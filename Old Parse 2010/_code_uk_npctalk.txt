zts1e	Milano Tool Shop (Use)zts13e	Farewell.zts14e	So, what would you like to know?zts15e	How can I upgrade my equipment?zts16e	What is the main advantage of upgrading my equipment?zts17e	How do I change my partner's equipment?zts18e	He looks just like you. Who is he? Your twin?zts19e	To upgrade your equipment, you will need Cella powder and a Soul gem.zts20e	Only weapons and clothes can be upgraded.These upgrades range from level 1 to 10. The amount of Cella powder required for upgrade will increase with the level.zts21e	I also a charge a transaction cost for that. That's about it. Understood?zts22e	Er.. How do I get this Cella powder and Soul gem?zts23e	From Gillion stones. You get them by refining Gillion stones.zts24e	These stones can be found everywhere and can be refined using the Soul gem refiner.zts25e	It's a little difficult to get a Soul gem but Cella powder should be easy to find.zts26e	If you are lucky, you might even find a perfect Soul gem.zts27e	Thanks, I understand now.zts28e	Your attack and defense power increases when you upgrade weapons and clothes.zts29e	But I don't see any changes on my attack/defense, only the + sign has been added to the item.zts30e	You got ripped off! Haha!! Don't panic. I was just kidding. The changes won't show up there.zts31e	Yet, when you are actually fighting, the effective attack and defense changes are based on the level difference between you and your opponent.zts32e	But.. how? (Is this for real??)zts33e	For example, your defense is calculated based on the difference between your opponents weapon level and your armor level.zts34e	If the difference is greater, the power also increases correspondingly. So, it is advisable to have high level equipment.zts35e	Ah! I get it now! Phew!! (It is for real!!)zts36e	What would you like to look at?zts37e	Show me the weapons.zts38e	Show me the clothes.zts39e	Show me other equipment.zts40e	The partner equipment can be used by your partner.zts41e	You need to get partner equipment because it increases their strength and capabilities.zts42e	It's very simple to make equipment for your partners. You can exchange any weapon or clothes that you use for partner equipment.zts43e	Do that and I'll convert it to partner equipment of the same level. But short-range weapons will remain short-range and vice versa.zts44e	If you want your partner to do short range attacks, it has to put on a short range weapon and the same range clothes.zts45e	And for long range attack, it has to put on a long range weapon and clothes of speed.zts46e	For a magical attack, it has to put on a magical weapon and clothes that improve mental acumen.zts47e	Who? This guy? He's my twin brother.zts48e	He just looks very busy, but in reality he's just lazing around.zts49e	Well, that guy always wants to hang around. Very careless. I don't trust him and won't give him any jobs to do.zts50e	By the way..zts51e	I've heard that he does strange things with equipment. Do not be fooled by his mysterious claims.zts52e	Oh really? Okay, I'll take your advice on that.zts53e	Milano Equipment Shop 2 (Use)zts62e	What are you placing as a bet?zts64e	If you've got any weapons or clothes without any unique properties, then show it to me!zts65e	With my divine skills, I will craft you a rare item.zts66e	Really? Are you sure? But why is it called a 'bet'?zts67e	Mistakes happen sometimes. I can't guarantee the same results every time. So, it's a gamble.zts68e	Really? How is that possible?zts69e	No, not much. Also, if the rare level is negative (-), I will never make a failure.zts70e	If the rare level is high?zts71e	Well, I'm not really sure about that.zts72e	I'm certain that after I touch it, if the item doesn't disappear, one of the rare levels from 1 to 7 will definitely be applied.zts74e	Milano NosCamp (Use)zts101e	End conversation.zts102e	What would you like to know?zts104e	When I start the TimeSpace mission, how is 'Mission Start' different from 'Challenge Records'?zts119e	Basically, there is not much difference. When the mission starts, the score is shown and recorded depending on the performance of each adventurer.zts120e	When you select 'Challenge Records', you can challenge the highest record using the score that you have earned.zts121e	What's the big deal then? I don't see any benefits from doing the record challenge.zts122e	No, it isn't like that. Once you break the record, your name will be recorded on the Stone of TimeSpace. Hence, you will gain the respect of every player! Isn't that awesome?zts123e	According to rumors, Sir Lopello will reward the players with the highest score sometime in the future. Above all, if you are truly an adventurer, your reputation is most important, right?zts124e	Then, don't you think that everyone would go for the record challenge instead? Why do the normal mission at all?zts125e	Haha! Of course not. The problem is that the record challenge costs money! And if they aren't confident enough, it would just be a waste of money.zts126e	So remember, you should be careful when you challenge the record.zts127e	Well, if we're not so ambitious then we don't have to do it.zts128e	Yes, of course! But why are you behaving like a coward? If you are an adventurer, then take the challenge! Show some adventurer spirit!!zts129e	Grr. I understand. I'll think about it.zts130e	Yes. I am Eril, the counselor. May you have a great adventure!zts131e	What kind of job would you like?zts132e	I want to slay evil and defeat villains with my shining blade! I want to be a swordsman.zts133e	I want to knock down villains before they even see me! I want to be an archer.zts134e	I want to be a sorcerer. I'll stun the forces of evil with my powerful magic!zts135e	If you change your occupation, you can no longer use the adventurer equipment that you currently have. You can only use equipment meant for your job.zts136e	Instead, we will give you equipment that you can use at your level. Is that alright with you?zts137e	How's the condition of the equipment?zts138e	Well, it is okay to use.zts139e	----------------------------------------------zts140e	Well.. money doesn't grow on trees and Sir Lopello no longer supports us like he used to, so.. blah blah..zts141e	Anyway, are you going to change your job?zts142e	Well, yeah sure. I will change it!zts143e	No, I will do something else. Like wander in the woods a little more.zts156e	Starting a family means managing a household with the people you meet in Nostale.zts157e	Help each other out and share their joys and sorrows! That is what family is all about! Enjoy the great world of Nostale with your nostale family.zts158e	I want to start a family.zts159e	I want to dismiss the family.zts160e	What must be done to start a family?zts161e	What are the commands & orders for managing a family?zts162e	Thanks a ton for your help. See ya later!zts163e	To start a family, you will need three adventurers who have successfully changed their jobs and cleared Act 1-1.zts164e	These three players form a party and one of them has to submit an application to me. It comes at a cost though.. 200,000 Gold!!zts165e	After that, he has to submit the family name. That's it. The person who submits the application becomes the Head of the family and the other two become the family's supporters.zts166e	And I apologize, since the family system is not completely developed yet. So, some functions cannot be used currently.zts167e	So, please be patient. We are doing our best to support you as quickly as possible.zts168e	Ok, I understand.zts169e	For Guild chat, you have to type the [: Your Message]zts170e	You can use the command order in the Chat Window. When you use it, use % instead.zts171e	If you want someone to join your family, type [%invite [character name]]. Only the Head of the family and manager can do this.zts172e	Removing someone from the family can be done in two ways. If a family member decides to leave the family he can type [%leave [Character name]]. If the Head of the family decided to remove a family member he can type [%Kick [character name]]zts173e	The Head of the family and family supporters cannot be removed. Anyone who has been removed has to wait for three days to start a new family or join a different family.zts174e	Also remember that there should always be two supporters in a family. To change the family supporters, type [%current supporter new supporter]zts175e	When you inherit the position of Head of the family, type [%inherit new character name]. This new Head of the family must be selected from the family supporters.zts176e	If you want to leave a message for all the family members who log on, type [%message [your message]]zts177e	Even though it's not perfect yet, I hope you enjoy the family experience!zts178e	I, Eril, will add more useful functions as soon as possible.zts179e	Milano Skill Registration Office (Use)zts191e	What would you like to know?zts192e	Tell me about the training in brief.zts193e	Tell me about Base Skills.zts194e	What is Plus Skill?zts195e	How can I delete skills?zts196e	Training directly influences your ability and once you learn it, it will have a permanent impact on your character.zts197e	There is a fee for education. You have to be at the corresponding combat level to get the training.zts198e	Are you talking about the number on the left in the 0/0 level sign? Is that the combat level?zts199e	Yes, it is! Training can be divided into three sections : Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. You can jump directly to intermediate training without going through basic training.zts200e	Really? Are there any difficulties in doing this?zts201e	No. There isn't much of a difference when you go directly to the second level, instead of doing it in order.zts202e	But it will be easier for you to do it in order.zts203e	Base Skills are those skills which you will use later.zts204e	To learn a Base Skill, a certain amount of Gold and CP are required. Also, you have to be at the corresponding job level to get a chance to learn.zts205e	Are you talking about the number on the right in the 0/0 level sign? Is that the job level?zts206e	Yes. Base Skill requires CP. If you don't have enough CP, you cannot learn it.zts207e	CP will increase as your Job Level rises. But CP is not enough to learn all skills. So, you need to take care while selecting appropriate skills.zts208e	Plus Skill is a special skill that adds a new power to the Base Skill.zts209e	For example, once you learn how to do the 'Sudden Attack' and also learn 'Stern' in addition; Stern will be added to your Sudden Attack.zts210e	So, the same skill can have different effects, depending on the Plus Skill.zts211e	Yes, one Base Skill can connect a maximum of 4 types of Plus Skills.zts212e	There's one thing you need to be careful about: when you see the bottom right part of the Plus Skill icon, there are circle and square icons. These signs show that you cannot learn Plus Skills of the same shape at the same time.zts213e	What do those shapes mean?zts214e	When you check the skill box, there are identical signs in the Plus Skill slot. These signs represents what kind of slot the skill has to go into.zts215e	Oh, I see. The same shapes go into the same slot. So, I cannot learn them at the same time.zts216e	If you go ahead and learn a Plus Skill in the same shape, it means that the old skill will be overwritten. Don't worry though. In this case, you will get a warning message.zts217e	If you don't like an existing skill or need CP to learn another skill, you can delete the existing skill.zts218e	To delete an existing skill, double-click the skill in the skill purchasing window.zts219e	When a skill is deleted, the CP that you spent for that skill will be refunded. But to delete the skill, you will have to pay the same amount that you paid to get the skill.zts220e	Base Skills can be deleted only after all the Plus Skills are deleted.zts221e	Training cannot be deleted. Since you haven't spent any CP on it, you won't lose anything, right?zts222e	Milano Alchemy Associationzts233e	Milano Mart (Use)zts257e	Milano Fashion Accessories (Use)zts266e	Ok, tell me.zts267e	Tell me about accessories.zts268e	Accessories are fashionable and indicate the social status of the wearer.zts269e	But, I see that you are looking at something functional. Hmmm..zts270e	Accessories have surprising magical powers. It could be said that magic is melted and molded into the accessories.zts271e	There is also a slot option to add new powers.zts272e	What? Can you explain it in more detail?zts273e	I knew you would be interested in this part. I will surely tell you.zts274e	In accessories there are 'Option Slots' and 'Option Levels'.zts275e	Option Slot tells you the number of options that you can put in and Option Level tells you up to which level you can put. Do you follow?zts276e	Yes! But how can you put the options in?zts277e	You will need a Cellon for this. Cellons are shiny gems.zts278e	Cellon level decides the option level. So, the higher the level of the Cellon, the better it is.zts279e	Ah, but you cannot choose which options to put in. So, everything is decided by fate and your luck.zts280e	Where can I get a Cellon?zts281e	Cellon can be obtained by refining Gillion stone. You will need the Cellon Refinery to refine it.zts282e	The Refinery can be purchased at the Alchemy Association.zts283e	TimeCircle (Milano)zts285e	Join the private infinite arena.zts286e	Join the family infinite arena.zts287e	See the TimeCircle list.zts290e	Select the town you wish to travel to.zts291e	Koaren town in Mt.

Introzts308e	Act 1. The Tree of Fernonzts309e	Attention amateur adventurers! I will give you your first mission.zts310e	End the strike in Kovolt Town.zts311e	But the situation worsens and escalates into war.zts312e	In the ensuing chaos, the heroes make an appearance.zts313e	The enemies who will stop you.zts314e	The resurrection of the Fernon Tree that might throw the whole world into chaos.zts315e	Do you have what it takes to undertake this adventure?zts316e	Now.. this is only the first level.zts317e	Nevertheless, pay heed to me. This will be the great story of a low level adventurer.zts318e	Act 2 Intro.zts319e	Everyone helped each other to overcome the crisis.zts320e	It is not over yet. No one knows when the Fernon Tree will be awakened.zts321e	Catsy, a mysterious tribe had the key that could seal the Fernon Tree.zts322e	However, Kovolt and Catsy have been enemies for centuries.zts323e	If they start fighting, it will lead to war.zts324e	The crisis is not over yet.zts325e	Another crisis arises, bringing with it a new adventure!zts326e	Act 2: The Resurrection of the Devilszts327e	Wait! My white sheep is crying..zts328e	Milano Village NPC Conversationzts329e	You are just a rookie, aren't ya?zts330e	Yes. However, I will do my best!zts331e	You have courage, but be warned that things will not go as planned.zts332e	What do you mean? Are the Kovolts on strike?zts333e	Well, it's because the working conditions are horrible. Everything is bad.. and also..zts334e	Bah! You might not have treated them properly. Should I give them a lesson in good manners?zts335e	Haha! Yes, but we have to gather some more information.zts336e	Information? What information? It's obvious. The lazy bastards will start complaining again!zts337e	The Kovolts are protesting more severely than we thought, right?zts338e	Well, the world seems to be in chaos. It is a big problem.zts339e	But it looks like there are reasons behind that.zts340e	Reasons? What reasons? That stupid creature has a bad habit of complaining!zts341e	Will the war ever end?zts342e	Who will be victorious in the war between the humans and the Kovolts?zts343e	How did the situation get resolved so easily? I didn't think the Kovolts were so incompetent.zts344e	I never expected the war to end so easily. Who would have thought that the Kovolt would have internal troubles?zts345e	What will happen now? I worry so much that I cannot sleep.zts346e	We cannot give up now. We will do our best till the end.zts347e	No! There is nothing that we can do now. They are much stronger than we are.zts348e	Look at me! Why did I have to go through all this? Why did I have to suffer like this?zts349e	Glad to see ya! How have you been?zts350e	Hello. You may not be familiar with everything. All the best.zts351e	Please! I beg you! Fight on behalf of our village.zts352e	Strike? Oh my God! I hope nothing bad happens.zts353e	There is a growing feeling of worry. Let's keep our spirits high though.zts354e	What a horrible situation!zts355e	Thank you for your hard work.zts356e	This makes me depressed. I don't want to talk about this!zts357e	Excellent! You are my hero!zts358e	You remind me of my childhood days.zts359e	How was I back then? Was I stupid like you? Haha..zts360e	Do you want to hear a funny story? *snicker*zts361e	It is..zts362e	Puha~.zts363e	It's so funny that I cannot tell you about it now.zts364e	Welcome back. Do you remember what I was going to tell you the other day?zts365e	I can tell you now. I can hold back my laughter.zts366e	It is..zts367e	A long time ago, there was a thorny mouse.zts368e	..zts369e	Pffff.zts370e	Pfff. Haha.. How come the thorny mouse was there?.. That's hilarious.. Haha..zts371e	Well, I'll continue the story later. Haha..zts372e	Let's not lose heart as difficult times loom ahead.zts373e	To keep our spirits high, let me tell you a really funny story.zts374e	Hey! Where are you going? Why don't you listen to my story?zts375e	Hey..zts376e	A funny story, eh? Do you really want to tell me that story now?zts377e	Thank you for being so nice to me. To return your kindness, I will tell you a funny.. Hey! Where are you going?zts378e	And for today, this is a special story about Lanetan from the Tree of Fernon.zts379e	If they blow themselves up, they become potato chips! Haha..zts380e	Haha!zts381e	Gosh! It's not funny! Should I die here?zts382e	Hello, this reminds me of a funny story that just popped into my head.zts383e	What would happen if the Lanetan blows up?zts384e	Don't know? The answer is..zts385e	Potato Chips!! Wasn't that hilarious?zts386e	This is my funniest joke ever!zts387e	Hey, if you are just a rookie, you need to behave yourself. And be quick!zts388e	Hey, why are you dawdling? Run! Quickly!zts389e	Filthy Kovolts! Noisy Kovolts!zts390e	What a day!zts391e	What will happen to Milano Village now?zts392e	We're all going to die! This is the end! We're finished!zts393e	Come in! No one trusts me when I say that I'm a good friend of yours. Give me your autograph as proof.zts394e	The weather is beautiful and I don't have to do any work. Ah, this is the life!zts395e	Why did you join NosCamp? It's not too late. Come back to Sir Lopello's Guard!zts396e	Stop whining now. Go away! I have to find out if the Watch is coming in now.zts397e	I am so annoyed! Why on earth are the Kovolts on strike now?zts398e	Do something! Isn't this your duty?zts399e	Kovolts! Noisy creatures!zts400e	Good job, you losers!zts401e	To make matters worse, there might be a war!zts402e	See? How dare they start fighting against the humans? Haha!!zts403e	Don't say anything. My life is over!zts404e	Salute! Everything is A-ok!zts405e	Milano Conversation with Jackzts406e	I heard that some people didn't make it back after the adventure. They are still missing. Anyway, good luck!zts407e	Oh you're still safe? Well, I reckon it's because there hasn't been anything dangerous yet. Anyway, all the best!zts408e	I heard that you are better than the other adventurers. However, you shouldn't become arrogant. Okay?zts409e	What? You shouldn't be making a big fuss about it, right? Well, anyway..zts410e	The serial number of the Adventurer Sword is NTR40U-10X. It has excellent power.. for its price. This is why the Smith has stopped making it now.zts411e	While polishing your sword, we suggest you use a rag made of polyester. Polyester rags have been known to have a cooling effect on the blade.zts412e	When you find yourself facing an enemy in leather armor, lift your sword and bring it down at an angle of 36.5 degrees. We have found that the Collagen in leather can be easily cut off at that particular angle.zts413e	There are two types of Bow strings. The first type is made out of three strings and is twisted twenty times. The second type is made of five strings and is twisted fourteen times. According to our research, the second type decreases the stress on the fingers by 0.2%, but nobody really feels the difference.zts414e	That equipment? Man, if you had purchased this when you bought the other tools, you would have got something free.zts415e	Milano Conversation with the Manager of the Mines.zts416e	The mines owned by Sir Lopello produces the largest amount of Gillion stone in Eastmile. The people of Eastmile benefit from this.zts417e	Sometimes, a dog will bite its master.zts418e	The Kovolt bastards! I may not enjoy a long life because of that.zts419e	What kind of a world do we live in nowadays? A war with the Kovolts? Haha..zts420e	Is this the time to relax? I knew the Kovolt would do something like this.zts421e	I got drunk to drown my sorrows. (Hic) There is no joy in my life. The dead roots of the Fernon tree isn't going to kill us, is it? (Hic)zts422e	The Kovolts worked hard too. A few days ago, Sir Lopello awarded a good Kovolt miner. The misunderstandings have been cleared. Isn't that great!zts423e	Manager at Mine entrancezts424e	Adventurer? I know this sounds ridiculous. But I was thrown out by the Kovolts from the Mines.zts425e	Why are they acting like this?zts426e	Isn't it your job to handle this, adventurer? DO something!zts427e	What? Strike? What the heck are they talking about?zts428e	They did nothing. Why are they responding this way? I hate living with the Kovolts!!zts429e	What? A war? Hahahahah. Muhahahahaha!!zts430e	See? I knew this was going to happen. War? Don't even dream about it!!zts431e	What a big problem!! Who's going to solve this?zts432e	I have been treating my Kovolt friend very badly these days. I will approach them more generously.zts433e	Koaren Guard 1zts434e	* Bark* Why do you human beings come here?zts435e	Come, you human!

Just surrender!!zts1066e	Hahaha.. Is this what I get after trusting the betrayer!!zts1067e	Just give up! All the Kovolt soldiers are killed!zts1068e	Haha.. I know. Yet, I cannot betray my people just because of this life!zts1069e	And then I cannot help it!zts1070e	The Demons' minions!! Bring it on!!zts1071e	!!zts1072e	Don't compromise with anyone who sells their soul to the Demons!! Come on!!zts1073e	Nope!!zts1074e	This voice is. Kenel?zts1075e	A while light surrounds Koaren. Koaren disappears all of sudden. That's the Wing of Return!!zts1076e	I've never heard of Kovolts using the Wing of Return!!zts1077e	Scenario of TimeSpace 31zts1078e	*Gasping*zts1079e	Stop chasing the master!!zts1080e	He disappeared!! I cannot just let him go!!zts1081e	Didn't I tell you not to chase us!!zts1082e	It's just one second!! I just want to ask you something.zts1083e	What a stupid man!!zts1084e	You are so stubborn!!zts1085e	I am begging you. Please, give me some time.zts1086e	I have a strange feeling. There are a large number of Demons. Would the injured KrrKoaren be able to fight them?zts1087e	Demons!! The injured KrrKoaren and Kenel are under the attack of the Demons.zts1088e	Player: Hey!!zts1089e	*Coughing* It's going to get worse!!zts1090e	I do not want to attack you now. Let's get rid of those Demons!zts1091e	Why are you helping us?zts1092e	KrrKoaren!!zts1093e	I want to ask you something.zts1094e	You are so rude!!zts1095e	Stop Kenel!! And hey, humans. You saved my life, so I will answer whatever you want to ask me. What is it?zts1096e	What kind of agreement is there between Lopello and the Demons?zts1097e	Please.. tell me.zts1098e	Well, you do not know?zts1099e	Master!! Do not trust these human beings!!zts1100e	In a nut shell, Lopello sold Mt. Krem to the Demons. We have lived there for more than a 100 years and it's our homeland. Now we don't have any place to return to.zts1101e	!!zts1102e	.. and Lopello has acquired the right to mine in the Northern land of Kreano in return.zts1103e	Really?zts1104e	Are you sure you do not know this?zts1105e	Stop Kenel! Don't you get it? These human beings are not interested in the fact that we are being kicked out of Mt. Krem.zts1106e	..zts1107e	We have been fighting for our survival. You human beings have no clue.zts1108e	I am so sorry. I thought it was just a strike.zts1109e	For the last 100 years, we have been working so hard in spite of the worst working conditions. But you human beings take it all for granted.. It's okay. Everything is over. You do not have to be sorry either. Just go back home!zts1110e	Go away, human beings!zts1111e	Kenel! We. We are going to Kenko. We must know! The reason why Kenko betrayed.zts1112e	Scenario of TimeSpace 35zts1113e	Someone is watching us.. Just be aware and cautious!!zts1114e	Someone is trying to do something. This tension.. We must be careful.zts1115e	This might be a trap.. but I can't prove it. But my intuition keeps telling me to leave this place.zts1116e	It's too quiet And too easy. I have the feeling that we are being setup.zts1117e	Master!! Do not trust these human beings!!zts1118e	(Gasping)zts1119e	Human beings!! The ones that extorted us and tortured us!zts1120e	We should kill them now!!zts1121e	No. They are not our enemy. The real enemy is Lopello and the Milano guards. We are small in number. Do not consider all human beings as our enemies.zts1122e	Really?zts1123e	Okay.. and then, we will stop it!zts1124e	You human beings!! You may go back! It's ok!zts1125e	When I told you to leave, I meant it.zts1126e	I just wanted to thank you.zts1127e	No, that's unnecessary. I may not feel hostility towards you, but certainly doesn't mean that I am your friend. Humans does not get along with Kovolts. Whether you stay here any longer or not, is up to you. But know that I don't guarantee you safety.zts1128e	Yes, I will.zts1129e	And never.. never come back.. This is the last land of the Kovolts. The smell of human beings makes us sick.zts1130e	Scenario of TimeSpace 36zts1131e	Koarens: Help us. Please, help us!zts1132e	Didn't I tell you not to come back here?zts1133e	Wait! I want to ask you something!zts1134e	I have no intentions to respond to your question. Go back. I am suffering enough with this internal conflict.zts1135e	Why are you helping us?zts1136e	Because it seems like you are looking for help.zts1137e	Kenel!! What are you here for?zts1138e	You again?zts1139e	Kung: Kenel, the enemies have all retreated!zts1140e	Kenel: Good work!zts1141e	Kung: But this man is.zts1142e	Player: So we meet again.zts1143e	Kenel: Do you guys know each other?zts1144e	Kung: Kenel, let me ask you one question.zts1145e	Kenel: Sure, whatever.zts1146e	Kung: Do you trust human beings?zts1147e	Kenel: I do not.zts1148e	Kung: Then how come you accept this man?zts1149e	Kenel: ..zts1150e	Kung: Please, tell me. I trust your judgment.zts1151e	Kenel: This man might have the body of a human. but he has the soul of a brave Kovolt.zts1152e	Player:!!zts1153e	Kung: Okay.. I understand. I will also believe that the brave soul of a Kovolt is inside him!zts1154e	Player: Thank you!!zts1155e	Kung: I will see you again.zts1156e	Kenel: You look like you're in a hurry. What happened?zts1157e	Kung: Nowadays it seems like Kenko is up to something suspicious. I have to inspect this further.zts1158e	Scenario of TimeSpace 37zts1159e	The base camp of Kenko.. but things are in disarray. The stench of the Demons linger in the air. It does not look like the base camp of Kenko's elite troop.zts1160e	Help me!! Help us!!zts1161e	Get out, you Demons!!zts1162e	I will get rid of you all!!zts1163e	The soldiers of Kenko look out of their minds! What happened here? They are attacking here all of sudden.zts1164e	I do not want to fight. Just go!!zts1165e	??zts1166e	If you want to kill me, do it!. I cannot live any longer!!zts1167e	What made you come here?zts1168e	I also feel that Kenko is being suspicious.zts1169e	Everyone in Kenko has gone insane. I think they have been poisoned by some drug or magic. But I do not know more than this.zts1170e	Attack them!zts1171e	Attack them!!zts1172e	Enemies!! We will talk about this later.zts1173e	Escape here first. We need to look around here a little more.zts1174e	I see, take care!zts1175e	I never expected to hear such words from a human being. It's not bad. Anyway, you take care too!zts1176e	Scenario of TimeSpace 38zts1177e	You have some gut! You come here as if nothing has happened!!zts1178e	It's the same to you, isn't it?zts1179e	Hahaha.. I don't like you, however at least you are not completely useless.zts1180e	You too!zts1181e	Okay, good! Once we meet up, let's work together as a team. Let's go to Kenko's office. We can fine some clues there.zts1182e	What the!!zts1183e	It's military documentation. It might be useful. Let's check it out.zts1184e	Report: Successfully injured the Tree of Fernon. The poisonous gas came out of the tree and many soldiers are intoxicated and have been requested to move to a safe place.zts1185e	The Tree of Fernon?zts1186e	What is that?zts1187e	Did they want the Tree of Fernon?zts1188e	What is it?zts1189e	Human!! Grab the report and get out of here!!zts1190e	Get them!!zts1191e	That's Kenko.zts1192e	Be quiet. Just hide yourself!!zts1193e	Fernon will be unsealed soon, but our disaster is not small as we thought.zts1194e	Many of the soldiers have been poisoned to death. Nobody told me this.zts1195e	Anyway, when the seal is broken, every living creature in Mt. Krem will die.zts1196e	We are not helping you so that you can just be killed!!zts1197e	The human beings in Milano will die!! Koarens will also die. All the mines and Milano will be yours.zts1198e	I've already betrayed my species. I do not want to drive my people to death.zts1199e	When Fernon wakes up, the sky will open up and the land will be divided. The glory of Hellrod will never forget you. A small sacrifice is inevitable. So, survive!! We will respect whoever survives.zts1200e	*Krrrr* I will not continue this unfair trade.zts1201e	We acted on the agreement. We promised to you the mines of Milano, not your lives.zts1202e	What if I no longer cooperate with you?zts1203e	Once you break the agreement, you will die. We will go find a new partner.zts1204e	.. You mean it.zts1205e	Kovolts of Kreano. Your land has already become the Demon's land. You, miserable creatures, you can neither deny nor resist. We promised you a new land. Just keep up the promise. We will give the land of Milano to all survivors, in the glory of Hellrod.zts1206e	We have no choice.zts1207e	We do not need to talk about the old contract. But, from a couple minutes ago..zts1208e	??zts1209e	Someone has been overhearing our conversation.zts1210e	What is it?zts1211e	They found me!zts1212e	I will continue to fight till the end!zts1213e	No, go and tell Kung of all the things that you have heard. I will handle the situation here.zts1214e	But!zts1215e	Both of us cannot die here. Hurry up!zts1216e	Kenel!zts1217e	If we can survive this, let's meet again!zts1218e	Scenario of TimeSpace 40zts1219e	This is the first Energy stream. Hurry up!!zts1220e	Okay!zts1221e	Well, here it is. Take the seal.zts1222e	Scenario of TimeSpace 41zts1223e	This is the second Energy stream. Hurry up!!zts1224e	Scenario of TimeSpace 42zts1225e	This is the third Energy stream. Hurry up!!zts1226e	Scenario of TimeSpace 43zts1227e	This is the fourth Energy stream. Hurry up!!zts1228e	Well, we made it.. The Fernon tree has stopped growing!zts1229e	Is it all done then?zts1230e	No.. The growth has stopped temporarily. If we leave it like this, the energy stream will move to another place and will take another form.zts1231e	What should be done then?zts1232e	We need to attack the trunk of the tree. Since the growth has stopped, the strength of the tree has become weak. It's the right time to attack!zts1233e	Okay, I will try. I will attack it by all means possible.zts1234e	This way!! Just go straight!! Ignore the enemies that come your way, just move on!zts1235e	Yes. We almost made it. Please, this way!zts1236e	Enemies again?zts1237e	Dryad, the Imp of Fernon.zts1238e	Dryad 1: Enemy of Fernon, you will pay for this with your life!zts1239e	Dryad 2: May the curse of Fernon always stay with you!!zts1240e	Dryad 3: Fernon!! May you accept the blood of these scum!!zts1241e	Dryad 4: Fernon!! May you open the eyes!zts1242e	There are too many!!zts1243e	I didn't know they were this many!!zts1244e	I can't hold them off anymore!!zts1245e	We must run away!! We can't be killed here!!zts1246e	But I cannot move!! I'm sorry!!zts1247e	What? Already? Young man, are you going to give up so easily?zts1248e	Where is this voice coming from?zts1249e	Well, just go back!!zts1250e	All of sudden, everything turns white.zts1251e	*Crrrr*zts1252e	*Ahhhh!! *zts1253e	Miner 1: Greedy Lopello has to apologize!!zts1254e	Miner 2: Stop the unfair torture!!zts1255e	Miner 3: There are humans!!zts1256e	Well, I am in trouble..zts1257e	Miner 1: Are you working for Lopello?zts1258e	Miner 2: If you are, then you will not be forgiven.zts1259e	Wait!! Just let me explain first.zts1260e	Miner 1: Lopello's minion has come all the way here!!zts1261e	Miner 2: Let's get out of here! We'll be dead if we get caught!zts1262e	Wait! Just.. Just wait!zts1263e	Old Miner: He.. We won't be deceived by your tricks!zts1264e	Just listen to me! I just want to tell you the story.zts1265e	Old Miner: Promise me that you will not drive us away!! Except that, nothing is necessary!!zts1266e	Take it easy!! Go back to work! Sir Lopello will acknowledge all your requests!!zts1267e	Old Miner: Puhahahaha!! Hahahaha!!zts1268e	Old Miner: I will not be deceived anymore! Lopello has never tried to listen to our words. He just sent his forces to beat up our brothers.zts1269e	Well, that's because.zts1270e	Old Miner: You are the same. Brothers! Let's beat this guy up!zts1271e	Old Miner: It's strong! Brothers, let's retreat!zts1272e	Old Miner: What a stubborn guy!! Yet we will never give up!zts1273e	Old Miner: You've been chasing me! You thought that everything will be over once you catch me? Well, this is the end of my life. But our brothers will continue to fight!!zts1274e	Old Miner: It's so sad.zts1275e	Why do you fight so fiercely like this?zts1276e	Old Miner: For survival.zts1277e	Old Miner: Do not bother me anymore. Just go away. It's the end of my life. But my brothers will never forgive you!zts1278e	Hey, we meet again!!zts1279e	Glad to see you, Rhain!zts1280e	But I feel a bit sad to see you here.zts1281e	?zts1282e	You and I are warriors, taking the responsibility of protect our friends from the evil one. That's why I have been fighting the Demons. But, This is.zts1283e	Now, our enemies are those poor Kovolts.zts1284e	Yes. It's the Kovolts that are sweating and working so hard in the mines, for us humans. They are not our enemies. We should listen to them.zts1285e	But, they never try to tell us anything.zts1286e	Do you think that they haven't been trying to cooperate, from the beginning? They tried to get closer to human beings by all possible means. But, they weren't allowed to set foot in the town.zts1287e	I really wanted to listen to them, but they just.zts1288e	The Kovolts don't trust the humans any more. A few days ago, when they brought a letter to Sir Lopello, his guards snatched the letter and beat them up.zts1289e	Really? How can this be?zts1290e	That's why those poor friends had to fight against us. I knew everything behind this.zts1291e	..zts1292e	I came here to finish their protest.zts1293e	Miner 1: Here come the guards of Milano!!zts1294e	Miner 2: Attack them!!zts1295e	This.. This is not fair. I can't continue this!zts1296e	Guard Captain: Hey, Rhain!zts1297e	Do not get me in!! This is meaningless!zts1298e	Guard Captain: Shoot, the enemies are coming down! We will talk about it later!zts1299e	Miner 1: Hang in here!zts1300e	Miner 2: This line has to be protected. Otherwise, everything will be over.zts1301e	A large number of Kovolts are standing, surrounded by the guards of Milano. They look very tired and scared.zts1302e	Guard Captain: Arrest them all!zts1303e	No!!zts1304e	Guard Captain: Hey, we are the guards of Milano. What do you think you are doing?zts1305e	This is not fair combat. We have just desecrated our honor.zts1306e	Guard Captain: Hold your tongue! Or you will be the first person I arrest!zts1307e	.. No!!zts1308e	Ahhh? Is it you?zts1309e	If you are going to arrest Rhain, arrest me first!zts1310e	Guard Captain: Hmmmm.zts1311e	Guard 1: Gosh! I think Rhain is right!! Arrest me also!zts1312e	Guard 2: I think this mission is unreasonable. These Kovolts haven't really done anything bad!!zts1313e	Guard 3: Sir! Let's just go back. What on earth are we doing now?zts1314e	Guard Captain: ..zts1315e	This is all we want!zts1316e	Guard Captain: Well.. Okay.. You are right. I am ashamed of myself. Let's retreat!!zts1317e	Captain, thank you!!zts1318e	Let's get out of here. It feels like everything has been settled and solved. I feel like flying!zts1319e	Wait!!zts1320e	Err. Yes??zts1321e	I think I should say thank you.zts1322e	No, you shouldn't. It is me who should be thankful to you!zts1323e	Where are you planning to go?zts1324e	Wherever my heart takes me.zts1325e	I will come along with you.zts1326e	Yes??zts1327e	I will go with you, I would never let go of a true friend like you.zts1328e	You are welcome to join me.zts1329e	The armed forces of the Kovolts are coming. The strange silence of the battlefield will make people really uncomfortable.zts1330e	Knights Captain: The combat will take place here. Do not just hang around here!zts1331e	Who dares to bring so many Kovolt soldiers?zts1332e	Knights Captain: It's KrrKoaren. People call him Gray Storm. He is the most powerful warrior of the Koaren tribes and completely different from the weak miners. I cannot assure your safety. Just leave!zts1333e	Knights Captain: The enemies are much larger in number than we thought. It is going to be a lot tougher than we expected.zts1334e	Guard: The guards of Milano will join us shortly.zts1335e	Knights Captain: Good! Its worth a shot now. Resume the attack, block KrrKoaren!!zts1336e	Knights Captain: Now we have backup! People!! Let's fight for victory and nothing less!!zts1337e	Whoever dares to stand in our way will be killed!zts1338e	Kovolt: Ahhhh!!zts1339e	Kovolt 1: Retreat!! Fall back!!zts1340e	Kovolt 2: Retreat and rearrange. We will counter them with KrrKoaren. He will arrive immediately!!zts1341e	Knights Captain: The Kovolts are running away!! Chase them!! Do not leave a single Kovolt alive!zts1342e	Guard Captain: No! We cannot proceed any further.zts1343e	Knights Captain: What? Are you afraid or what?zts1344e	Guard Captain: We are the guards of Milano. We cannot go any further from Milano.zts1345e	Knights Captain: Hahaha!! No, It's because you just lack the courage. Well, we do not need a coward like you!! GO!!zts1346e	Guard Captain: Do not insult our honor!zts1347e	Knights Captain: What? Do you have any pride at all? Haha.. If you cherish your life, just sit back and relax!zts1348e	Guard Captain: (In a low voice) We do not like these meaningless fights!zts1349e	Knights Captain: What did you say?zts1350e	Guard Captain: No. Never mind. We will go back now.zts1351e	Kovolt 1: Gray Storm is flowing.zts1352e	Kovolt 2: KrrKoaren. He's coming.zts1353e	Kovolt 3: Oh, you are the great warrior!!zts1355e	Is he KrrKoaren?zts1356e	Knight 1: Look! A large number of enemies are coming!!zts1357e	Knight 2: It's beyond our control!zts1358e	Knights Captain: Let's retreat for a while. Regroup the soldiers.zts1359e	Knight 3: All the escape routes are blocked!!zts1360e	Knights Captain: Gosh! Let's go out through the Eastern valley!! Hurry!!zts1361e	Knights Captain: Where are the enemies?zts1362e	Knight 1: We have evaded them.zts1363e	Knights Captain: (Gosh!!) That was scary. Let us prepare for a counter attack. We will go after a short break. Everyone, get ready!!zts1364e	Listen, human beings!!zts1365e	Knights Captain: Uhhh!! What?zts1366e	Human beings, you are all beset by us. Surrender!! Or DIE!!zts1367e	Knights Captain:!! This is a trap! It's an ambush!zts1368e	Knights Captain: Shoot!! I can't stand this any longer!!zts1369e	Uhhh!! I am tired.zts1370e	Get up!!zts1371e	Player: Well.. Where are we?zts1372e	Wake up!! This is an underground prison cell that the Kovolts have made.zts1373e	.. Who?zts1374e	Guard Captain: It's us! Even though we didn't join the battle, we were worried about adventurers like you. So, we kept an eye on you. Now, it ends like this.zts1375e	.. Sorry about this.zts1376e	Guard Captain: Let's talk about this later, first we have to get out of here.zts1377e	Can we get out of here?zts1378e	Guard Captain: This place used to be our patrolling area!! I used to know a secret place here. That's why I came all the way here to find you. Well, now let's hurry!!zts1379e	Kovolt 1: Look! They are running away!!zts1380e	Guard Captain: Shoot!! They have seen us!zts1381e	Guard Captain: Ummmm..zts1382e	What is the matter?zts1383e	Guard Captain: If we operate that equipment, we can get out of here more quickly.zts1384e	Then, open the door and leave right now.zts1385e	Guard Captain: However, if we switch the button on, the Kovolts will hear us and chase us.zts1386e	So.zts1387e	Guard Captain: Wait.. I have a plan, let us take the right. There is a detour. But this is much safer. What would you prefer?zts1388e	How am I supposed to know?zts1389e	There is an exit!!zts1390e	Guard Captain: Haha.. Not many guard patrols here. Let's go through directly!!zts1391e	Yes!!zts1392e	Guard Captain: Well, we made it out!!zts1393e	(Sigh!!) .. We are alive!zts1394e	Guard Captain: Many Kovolts died.zts1395e	Yes.. and so did many people.zts1396e	Knights Captain: This is what happens in war, we cannot avoid it.zts1397e	Guard Captain: Anyway, let's go back. No need to cry over spilt milk. Let's just be optimistic.zts1398e	This is a base camp of Kenko. Kenko is very hostile to human beings. Keep yourself away from their sight! Also, KrrKoaren is around here. Korkoaren and Kenko should never meet.zts1399e	KrrKoaren's coming here!!zts1400e	..zts1401e	Eliminate himzts1402e	Why?zts1403e	Because he will go against the will of the Demon.zts1404e	Still I don't find any reason good enough to kill him with my bare hands. I reject it!zts1405e	Do you think KrrKoaren will accept you, even though you rejected the battle against Lopello?zts1406e	Well, but still I cannot!zts1407e	We have promised the new land to your tribes.zts1408e	If you had not come to Kreano, we would not have requested the new land. Right?zts1409e	Kreano is the Holy place for Demons. It is sin for you to be settled in that place. If Father Demon was not generous, you would not stay here alive!zts1410e	(Krrrr) I will never point a sword at my tribe!!zts1411e	(It's getting serious.. Let's run away!)zts1412e	I urge you not to see Kenko!zts1413e	Can't you see? He has a contract with the Devil. Do you trust the guy who has sold his soul to the Devil?zts1414e	I am sure there must be a reason.zts1415e	No way!! What if Kenko betrays us..zts1416e	Hey! Watch your tongue!zts1417e	Master!!zts1418e	I will meet Kenko. I will trust my.. our brother!!zts1419e	(Grr) Kenko!!zts1420e	(Grrr) No time..!zts1421e	Why.. Why did you decide to help the Devils?zts1422e	Tell me!!zts1423e	Brother, I will not say any excuses.zts1424e	Master!! You do not need to waste your time anymore.zts1425e	It's not too late. Let's work together, brother!!zts1426e	Just go away!! Otherwise, I will..zts1427e	Brother!!zts1428e	I am asking you. Please, go!!zts1429e	Suddenly the earth shakes. It's a Demon!zts1430e	You don't have to.zts1431e	Shoot!zts1432e	KrrKoaren, Kenel!! Be careful!!zts1433e	Is this your response to it?zts1434e	Yes!! I will never forgive you! For the honor of our ancestors!zts1435e	Go get all of them.zts1436e	Master!! This way!! Come this way!!zts1437e	Hurry!!zts1438e	Good!! Lucky!!zts1439e	It is so sad!!zts1440e	Let's get out of here first!zts1441e	I am very disappointed with myself. I never expected to point a sword at my brother.zts1442e	We have no time!!zts1443e	Yes, we should get out of here first!!zts1444e	Sad!! (Grr) Kenko!! I will not forgive my brother anymore!!zts1445e	I was waiting!!zts1446e	Sorry. Kenel was.zts1447e	I knew. However, to rescue Kenel, we must hurry up!! Give me the report.zts1448e	Here is it!!zts1449e	The report on Fernon: Fernon was created by the will of Mother Erenia. This is a huge tree that connects heaven and hell.zts1450e	Gosh!! Kenko tries to break the seal of Fernon!!zts1451e	If the seal is broken, what will happen?zts1452e	Turn to the next page of the report.zts1453e	Report: The door to Fernon was sealed by the disciples of the God Zenas. In consequence, the pathways to the world were all blocked and the land of Mother Erenia became a huge prison. Areas of Mt. Krem and Milano were the place where Fernon was dried..zts1454e	It's not that big a prison.zts1455e	Idiot!! Look at the bottom!!zts1456e	Report: When the seal is broken, Fernon will regain its life. Its power would destroy all of Mt. Krem and Milano. All the creatures on earth will become mere fertilizer for Fernon and thus the tree will have eternal life.zts1457e	Everyone will die?zts1458e	Yes, but I think I get the meaning now. The purpose of the Demons.zts1459e	The purpose of the Demons?zts1460e	The Demons are originally creatures from another world. They cannot survive here. But some of the demons emerging from the North seem to have the power of survival and have already become a serious threat to us. But if the tree is completely unsealed.zts1461e	It means that the forces of the Demons can flow in here!!zts1462e	Yes! You are right. Unfortunately, we do not have much time! Let's get moving. If the seal is opened, everything will be over!!zts1463e	Through this pathway, we can approach the root of Fernon. We must stop the ceremony before Kenko finishes it!zts1464e	Knights Captain: You cannot go through!!zts1465e	We have no time!! Please, let us go!zts1466e	Knights Captain: Human beings are on the side of the Kovolts. I cannot forgive you.zts1467e	If we get delayed, all of us may get killed.zts1468e	Knights Captain: .. What are you talking about!!zts1469e	Take it easy and just relax!! Take a look at this.zts1470e	When he reads the report, he is astonished.zts1471e	Now, do you know what I meant?zts1472e	..zts1473e	Sir Lopello might have been interested in the rights to the mines in Kreano. Yet, the Demons did not care about that, right from the beginning! They intend to eliminate all of us!!zts1474e	Knights Captain: What!! It can't be!!zts1475e	It was a big mistake to start cooperating with the Demons in the first place, if not stupid.zts1476e	(Krrrr) Human beings are creatures of greed. We, the Kovolts, cannot even imagine this!!zts1477e	Knights Captain: What a shame!!zts1478e	Thanks to your stupidity, many of my brothers have been sacrificed.zts1479e	Knights Captain: I do not want to hear advice from a Kovolt!!zts1480e	Hahaha.. No wonder you are human!!zts1481e	Here is.zts1482e	A complex maze starts here. Don't get lost in here. We don't have time for that.zts1483e	Ahhhh (Groaning)zts1484e	What's this? The sounds are getting closer.zts1485e	It's Kenel!! It's very close now.zts1486e	Who is it!!zts1487e	Kenel!! You are alive!!zts1488e	It was you. Ahhh.zts1489e	Did you get hurt?zts1490e	How did you get here?zts1491e	I successfully escaped!! But, I got lost in this maze and badly wounded.zts1492e	Well.. You were lucky though.zts1493e	I snatched the key from the patrol guard. If we find an exit, we could get out with this key.zts1494e	Well, good!! However, we need to see Kenko before that!!zts1495e	I think we are at the end of maze.zts1496e	Grrrrrrr.zts1497e	Ahhhhhh!!zts1498e	Ukkk!!zts1499e	Well, I don't feel so good. Let's hurry!zts1500e	All the seals have opened up!zts1501e	Ahhhh!! We are too late!!zts1502e	Ahhh?? You are.zts1503e	We do not have time to waste with them. Let's leave!!zts1504e	They disappeared!!zts1505e	The place will collapse soon. Hurry!! Let's get out of here!!zts1506e	Aaargh!! We are all going to die!!zts1507e	It's too early to give up! There is a solution!!zts1508e	The Tree just woke up, and didn't get back its full power. If we can cut off its energy stream, we can stop the tree from awakening completely.zts1509e	Is that true?zts1510e	I will go with you. We shall do it by all means.zts1511e	If you go this way, it may be a bit longer but you can approach the heart of Fernon without being caught by the Imps.zts1512e	Do. do you think I can make it?zts1513e	Trust yourself!! Believe in yourself and your friends!!zts1514e	But.. I am not confident!!zts1515e	Stop right there!! Enemies of Fernon!!zts1516e	Ahhhh!! They are strong!!zts1517e	It's too early to give up! Someone's coming. Who are they? Are they Imps?zts1518e	Guard Captain: What are you doing here?zts1519e	Hey!!zts1520e	Guard Captain: Keep moving forward!! I will handle things here.zts1521e	You are!zts1522e	Guard Captain: Do not talk too much!! How dare you come here without me? I will be angry with you later, but not right now!!zts1523e	It's hard to stand any longer.zts1524e	Not yet.zts1525e	Knights Captain: Already? You want to give up?zts1526e	Captain!!zts1527e	Knights Captain: Do not worry about me. Keep moving forward. All of these things happened because of me and Lopello. I will take that responsibility!! I am sorry!zts1528e	Is. Is this the end!!zts1529e	(Coughing) What are you still doing here?zts1530e	Kenel!! With that body.zts1531e	No time!! Just leave me and go kill Fernon!!zts1532e	I am so tired.zts1533e	Are you giving up?zts1534e	Rhain!!zts1535e	I had a hard time catching up!! I will take care of things here.zts1536e	Thanks Rhain.. I mean it!!zts1537e	It was a great time traveling with you!! Hurry up!! Fight for our friendship.zts1538e	Gosh!!zts1539e	Warriors!! Still, it is too early to give up!zts1540e	Kevin?zts1541e	Just leave!! I got your back!!zts1542e	Thank you, Kevin!zts1543e	Don't talk, just go!!zts1544e	Here. Here is.zts1545e	We made it!! It's the heart of Fernon.. Let's..!!zts1546e	Uhhhh! Attacking is useless.zts1547e	Is it beyond our power?zts1548e	No.. Not yet!!zts1549e	The enemies of Fernon!! I cannot forgive you!zts1550e	Enemy of the world. Enemy of my brother. I cannot forgive you either!!zts1551e	The sword of KrrKoaren penetrates the heart of Fernon! Suddenly, everything turns white. Consciousness turns blurry.zts1552e	Where are we?zts1553e	You are awake? You did it! We made it!zts1554e	Ahh.. Today was such a long day.zts1555e	I am tired of Lopello and the others.. Haha..zts1556e	I never expected to fight with human beings. (Grrrr)zts1557e	Is everything over?zts1558e	I think it is.. I just want to rest.zts1559e	By the way, where is KrrKoaren?zts1560e	Are you looking for me?zts1561e	You are still alive? Wow!! Wonderful!!zts1562e	Thanks to you, my brave friend! I need to thank you!zts1563e	Haha.. You are most welcome. Actually, I just did what I had to do.zts1564e	Yes. for this peace, many of our brothers have lost their lives.zts1565e	(Everyone looks down and remember the faces of the brothers who sacrificed themselves. some time passes. Suddenly a creepy smell comes from somewhere. It's the smell of a Demon..)zts1566e	De.. Demons!! You are Kenko??zts1567e	You!!zts1568e	I think I am lost. Warriors!!zts1569e	But remember, this is not the end! I will never forget what happened today!!zts1570e	The Demons and Kenko disappear.zts1571e	Yes. It's not the end!zts1572e	The Tree of Fernon has died already! The army of the Demons can no longer come into our world.zts1573e	Fernon is not dead. It is just sleeping now. It is the creature with eternal life.zts1574e	Then, what should be done?zts1575e	If we cannot kill it, we have to make it sleep forever with seals. We have to go and find a man who can seal the Tree.zts1576e	Seal?zts1577e	Are you talking about Catsy?zts1578e	Catsy??zts1579e	The faces of KrrKoaren and Kenel turn rigid all of a sudden. What would happen? The dark cloud over Elstern is not likely to go away. There still is a strong sense of danger. All of these adventurers hold their tongue to this feeling.zts1580e	Act 2zts1581e	This place of smells of devils. Mt. Krem is also full of it.zts1582e	What brought you here?zts1583e	Kenel! Good to see you!!zts1584e	While I was focusing on the war in Milano, Mt. Krem became so chaotic with the presence of the devils.zts1585e	Watch out!!zts1586e	(Sigh!!) .. Devils here tougher than the ones in Milano.zts1587e	Anything special in the town?zts1588e	It is very quiet. Come visit us. I have several things to tell you. Master also wants to know how you are doing.zts1589e	Haha.. yes.. Surely I will..zts1590e	I will investigate this place for a while.zts1591e	I will come along with you!zts1592e	Hmmmm.zts1593e	Anything happened?zts1594e	No, not really. I feel disgusted because of this bad smell.zts1595e	The Scent of the Devil. I am disgusted by it as well.zts1596e	I am not talking about the devil's scent. It is slightly different.zts1597e	Something even stranger. It gives me a headache.zts1598e	This is Catsy!!zts1599e	HoHoHoHo~zts1600e	Just stop there!! You nasty creature!!zts1601e	Those who do not know how to appreciate!! Bye!!zts1602e	Where is it? Uh?zts1603e	It's of no use. It disappeared. Instead, other guests are coming here.zts1604e	Kenel! I have something to ask. Who or what is that Catsy?zts1605e	A very disgusting species!zts1606e	Dis. disgusting?zts1607e	They are strange smelling creatures with weird names, moving around in dirty clothes.zts1608e	I do not know what you mean.. what is disgusting?zts1609e	Let's not talk about it anymore!zts1610e	But why did it say, people who do not know how to appreciate?zts1611e	Do not pay attention to those stupid comments!zts1612e	But.. Don't you think something is strange?zts1613e	I don't want to talk about it anymore. By the way, let's get out of here. It is of no use to investigate further.zts1614e	The ruins of Fernon can be seen. Even though the energy streams were cut off and has withered. it still looks very dangerous.zts1615e	Then is it because of the Fernon that the devils are becoming more aggressive and violent nowadays. But Fernon is sleeping, so?zts1616e	Fernon is not sleeping.zts1617e	Who? Who is there?zts1618e	Haha. You'd better watch out for the Devils.zts1619e	Who on earth is it??zts1620e	Hmm. You. Better than I thought. Haha.zts1621e	Where are you? Come out here and say!!zts1622e	Here.. there is.zts1623e	No! If you are curious, come and see for yourself.zts1624e	Huh!! Was I deceived??zts1625e	Yap.. Good job!!zts1626e	This.. you did this?zts1627e	No.zts1628e	Are you making fun of me?zts1629e	Hehe.. I don't have time to make fun of you, see?zts1630e	Do you see the lever at the center of the screen?zts1631e	Hmmm. Yes.zts1632e	Pull it.zts1633e	Hey! By the way, who are you?! Why are you making fun of me?zts1634e	Hmm.. I never made fun of you.zts1635e	Stop fooling around and show yourself!zts1636e	In the next room.zts1637e	What?zts1638e	Hahaha! If you come here, you can find me! Come on over! Why don't we talk over some coffee?zts1639e	Where are you!! Show yourself immediately!!zts1640e	Ta-dazts1641e	Yeeeks!zts1642e	Nice to meet you. My name is Charlotte de Whitewine!! I'm a noble princess of the Forest family!zts1643e	Who.. Who.. Who.. Who.. Who are you!!zts1644e	You Fool!! You've never seen a Catsy before?zts1645e	Hahaha. Ca.. ca.. tsy!! I heard that name for the first time today.zts1646e	No, no!zts1647e	Well, anyways, nice to meet you! What kind of drink do you want? Coffee, red tea, chocolate, cream soda, fresh fruit juice. Hmm. There's also mineral water if you don't want any of these.zts1648e	I. I don't need those! Just answer my question!zts1649e	I feel really embarrassed. You are investigating me like I'm some criminal.zts1650e	Shut up! Why were you fooling around with me?zts1651e	I never did.zts1652e	So what were you doing until now?zts1653e	I didn't do anything!!zts1654e	Are you making fun of me?zts1655e	I didn't even think of something like that. Haha!zts1656e	(It's cheating me. No. It's fooling me I guess)zts1657e	Don't give me that look, I feel so embarrassed!!zts1658e	So, what are you. doing here?zts1659e	Me? Now, I'm a prisoner of Fernon.zts1660e	What??zts1661e	Prisoner of Fernon! Yes it's me! And you are here to save me! Like a knight on a white horse! Thank you very much!zts1662e	If you are a prisoner, that means you don't have any relationship with the Devils?zts1663e	Of course I do. They put me here and kept their eye on me. But thanks to you, now I am set free!! Hoho!!zts1664e	(It's very complicated. I am getting a headache)zts1665e	You..zts1666e	Cute, you are. I must say.zts1667e	Oh!! Don't come closer!!zts1668e	Then bye!! Hehe!!zts1669e	Kenel! What is going on?zts1670e	They were here!zts1671e	They?zts1672e	The disgusting Catsies!!zts1673e	Ahhh!zts1674e	I don't know why they are irritating us, but if they want a fight, we won't say no. Let's investigate here now.zts1675e	Soldier 1: Yes!zts1676e	Soldier 2: Okay Sir!zts1677e	You!! Humans in front of me!!zts1678e	Ahhh, you are?zts1679e	My name is Cenil de Strawberrypie. I am the captain of the Rosebud Knights and White Witch in Catsy. I just want to ask you for directions, so please show me your generosity!!zts1680e	Ah. yes, please tell me.zts1681e	Do you know where the dirty Kovolts live?zts1682e	Ah!!zts1683e	I don't know why you look so surprised. but if my question was rude, I sincerely apologize.zts1684e	No, not at all. But, before answering you, I want to ask you one question.zts1685e	Yes, as you wish.zts1686e	You Catsy. How do you feel about the Kovolts?zts1687e	Those foolish, wild and filthy creatures.. I don't even want to mention their name!zts1688e	And then, why do you want to find them?zts1689e	To punish their discourtesy!!zts1690e	The Kovolts around this area are my friends. So with that reason, I am sorry, I can't give you the answer!zts1691e	Oh!! . You are a friend of the Kovolts?zts1692e	I don't know you. Go back if you are trying to pick a fight with my friends.zts1693e	Whoa!! If you are a friend of the Kovolts.zts1694e	(Cenil is grinning.)zts1695e	Your are our. enemy!!zts1696e	Rosebud Knights!! Punish him!!zts1697e	Rosebud Knights: In the name of Rosebud!!zts1698e	Ahhhh!!zts1699e	Don't kill him! We have to keep him alive until we find out where this filthy Kovolt village is!!zts1700e	Rosebud Knights: Yes Sir!zts1701e	Will it be?zts1702e	(Clang!! An explosive sound followed by a cloud of dust)zts1703e	Hey! Wake up!!zts1704e	Ah!! Kenel.zts1705e	Follow me before they see you!!zts1706e	Haha.. They won't keep you alive, once they know you are on the side of the Kovolts.zts1707e	Really.zts1708e	But it's so sad. Because of Fernon, the Koaren family are having a hard time.. Another war is upon us..zts1709e	Wa.. war? Is it that serious?zts1710e	Because we are Kovolts and they are Catsies!zts1711e	.. Is there an old grudge between the two species?zts1712e	I don't think so.zts1713e	Then why can't we be friends? Like you and I have become!zts1714e	Impossible..zts1715e	Why not? You never even tried.zts1716e	First of all I don't like the way they look!! Unpleasant!! Disgusting!! Snobbish!!zts1717e	Do you think that is a good reason?zts1718e	And their names. At the end of their names.. they put..zts1719e	What?zts1720e	They put the name of their favorite food!zts1721e	(Grrr) . Very. Just very creepy creatures!!zts1722e	Okay. So. Those problems you had. I mean.. might have.. might have had before.zts1723e	You human beings can't understand this. Just as you hate the fly and the roach, we hate the Catsies. We just don't get along. It's like oil on water. Once we see each other, we just feel the desire to terminate each other.zts1724e	And for that, you risk your lives just to terminate them?zts1725e	Those disgusting creatures that started this war first!!zts1726e	(He never gets it!!)zts1727e	Humans. I wanted to ask you for help, but I guess I can't.zts1728e	Go back!! I don't want to pull you into the faithless fight!!zts1729e	(Krrrrr) .. They.. They are very strong!! Retreat, retreat!!zts1730e	Knights of the Rosebud!! Show them our anger and power!!zts1731e	Kenel!! Are you alright?zts1732e	Ah! It's you!!zts1733e	Hmmm.. not bad, but let's not sacrifice more on both sides. But, I want to ask you some questions.zts1734e	No need to answer!! It's between you and me!! One of us will not be here from now on!!zts1735e	Do the filthy Kovolts even know the meaning of honor?zts1736e	Smelly Catsies!! How dare you mention honor with your ugly mouth!!zts1737e	Both of you stop!! Here, Mr.Cenil de Strawberrypie!! So what do you want to know??zts1738e	You fools.. Why did you wake Fernon up?zts1739e	Answer me!!zts1740e	How did you know that Fernon woke up?zts1741e	Shame on you! You don't even know what your crime is! Your ignorance is the crime!!zts1742e	I asked you something. How did you come to know that?!zts1743e	You sinner. Catsy is a creature of intuition. I know everything.zts1744e	We didn't wake Fernon up!!zts1745e	Ah ha! But Fernon doesn't wake up without a Kovolt's blood! So don't keep lying!zts1746e	That makes sense now. You awoke Fernon and what did you do to our princess?zts1747e	Princess?zts1748e	I know you didn't hurt our princess, because even now I can hear her heart beat, but if.zts1749e	Haha!!zts1750e	I'll give you a tour of hell if you lay a finger on the princess.zts1751e	Hahahahaha!! Ahahahahaha!!zts1752e	Are you laughing at me?zts1753e	You stinky Catsy.. Listen.. I'm not afraid of your empty threats. By the way, isn't it great.. The life of the Catsy's princess is in my hands!! Hahaha!!zts1754e	Kenel! What are you talking about!!zts1755e	Retreat!! Let us go back!!zts1756e	Remember. Even one scratch on her. And we go to war! And then you will only be able to regret this arrogance.zts1757e	Kenel!!zts1758e	(No need to fight anymore! Let's start searching for the Catsy's princess!!)zts1759e	Brothers!! The Catsy's Princess is somewhere around here!! Get her alive before today!! Let's hurry!!zts1760e	Ah!! Kenel!!zts1761e	Oh! What brings you here?zts1762e	I was just passing by.zts1763e	Are you by any chance looking for the Catsy's princess, like the others?zts1764e	No, no, no, no!!zts1765e	Hmmm. I smell fish, but it doesn't matter. You are human, so we cannot make you follow the Kovolt's law!zts1766e	Haha, anyway, bye! I don't have much time now.zts1767e	Sorry.zts1768e	Brothers!! Catsies are very smart. Look for the princess immediately!! We need to find the Catsy's princess by all means!! Let's hurry!!zts1769e	Oh.. you.. you are!!zts1770e	Hey knight! Help me out here!!zts1771e	What are you talking about!!zts1772e	I'll just go and hide.. you figure out something to say!!zts1773e	Ahh!!zts1774e	What are you doing here??zts1775e	Did you happen to see any Catsy girl running around here??zts1776e	Umm. That is.zts1777e	I guess I shouldn't have asked you.zts1778e	Ah. We meet again!!zts1779e	Yeah!! I need to talk to you!!zts1780e	Sorry, I don't have time for this, bye!zts1781e	It's dangerous here! You must leave this place immediately!!zts1782e	I.. know!! Bye!!zts1783e	Oh!! .. Are you still here?zts1784e	Yes.zts1785e	Are you planning to save the Catsy princess?zts1786e	No.. no.. I don't think.. so..zts1787e	I don't intend to put any pressure on you, but I am a little disappointed.zts1788e	Stop right there!!zts1789e	Oh!! My knight!!zts1790e	I told you this place is very dangerous!zts1791e	Ah.. Now.. are you worrying about me?zts1792e	No, no, no, no, noooo!!zts1793e	Thanks for your concern!! But I have something to do here!! Bye!!zts1794e	A fight between Charlotte and Kenel!! If I don't do anything now, it's going to be disastrous!!zts1795e	Stop this!!zts1796e	Oh.. My knight!!zts1797e	Mind your own business!!zts1798e	Stop it!! Kenel!! She's just a little girl!!zts1799e	Why are you stopping me?zts1800e	There's no need to fight! She just came here to seal Fernon!!zts1801e	I know!! But!!zts1802e	Then if you knew it.. you should stop!!zts1803e	But.. Catsy and Kovolt are not compatible!! This is our destiny!!zts1804e	Will you please you stop it!!zts1805e	If you guys don't stop arguing. I'll give up.zts1806e	What are you talking about!!zts1807e	I'll just go with this old doggy man. I will give up. I'm too tired.zts1808e	Ar.. ar.. are you insane?!?zts1809e	By the way.. my knight!zts1810e	I saved you!!zts1811e	Haha. you probably don't remember what happened back in Fernon's heart!!zts1812e	Oh.. you're.zts1813e	Thanks to you, I had been captured as a prisoner of Fernon for quite sometime.. I guess it's time to pay back!!zts1814e	She talks too much. Be quiet!! And brothers!! Arrest that smelly Catsy!!zts1815e	(It's silent. Flames on torches shake the silent air. Koaren guards are patrolling there. Avoid a conflict with them, otherwise the peace pact between the human beings and the Kovolts will be broken.. Let's sneak in there and save Prince Charlotte!!)zts1816e	Soldier 1: I heard that the dirty Catsies have started strolling around here, right?zts1817e	Soldier 2: (Grrrrr) A war is about to happen!!zts1818e	Soldier 1: A war??zts1819e	Soldier 2: The other day Captain Kenel had big fight with the Catsy knights. If their knights came to Mt. Krem, their goal is very clear!zts1820e	Soldier 1: (Grrr) I see, so that's why!!zts1821e	Soldier 2: Why?? What are you talking about?zts1822e	Soldier 1: There is a certain Catsy that has been captured. She must be around here somewhere.zts1823e	Soldier 2: Shoot!! That doesn't sound good. I'd hate to see any Catsies!zts1824e	Soldier 1: Well, anyways it's bad. It's hasn't been long since the war in Milano ended.zts1825e	Soldier 1: And you know that a Catsy girl is here??zts1826e	Soldier 2: (Grrrrr) . She smells nasty!!zts1827e	Soldier 1: Those horrible creatures call it perfume!! Nasty!!zts1828e	Soldier 2: Ugh.. It just gives me the creeps. I don't know why they are keeping her alive. Just kill her and bury her anywhere!!zts1829e	Soldier 1: (Grrrrr) . I've worked in this prison for a long time. But I have never felt this sick.zts1830e	Now, the Rosebud Knights are desperately searching for the princess. If they know that she's here, they will rush here immediately.zts1831e	Hmmmm.zts1832e	We will use her as bait to lure them here. Then we will disarm and execute all of them because they polluted our Mt. Krem.zts1833e	There's no need to kill the princess. And we won't fight against the knights.zts1834e	Can't you see? Catsy is the only tribe who can seal Fernon. So why should we turn Catsy into our enemies??zts1835e	No!!zts1836e	If Fernon wakes up, we are doomed. We'll lose many brothers. And even if we are alive, we'll lose the place to stay.zts1837e	Grrrr.zts1838e	I can't let my brothers die just because of some old grudge.zts1839e	I'll never compromise with Catsy, even if we lose our brothers!!zts1840e	Stop it. I'll untie the old grudge between Koaren and Catsy. And will put Fernon into everlasting sleep.zts1841e	Then don't keep her here!!zts1842e	You!! How did you get in here!!zts1843e	I guess with his skills, it's a piece of cake!!zts1844e	I don't know why the princess followed you, but there's no need to keep her here, is there? Please let her go!zts1845e	No, I can't.zts1846e	If she falls into the hands of Kenko.zts1847e	Huh! You seem to understand.zts1848e	But the Rosebud Knights won't let it happen.zts1849e	I wanted to see you because of this reason.. It is going to be easy since you are here.zts1850e	Pass my letter on to the knights.zts1851e	Yes? What kind of letter?zts1852e	A peace pact.zts1853e	Do not interfere with my decision warrior!! Leave now and meet Catsy!!zts1854e	It's not possible.zts1855e	And when you go out, go quietly, just as you sneaked in here. Nobody knows you were here, except for the 3 of us. I don't want to make a fuss with you around.zts1856e	Yes! Got it!! I will persuade Catsy to close it.zts1857e	Ahh!! Kenel.zts1858e	.. Sorry..zts1859e	I cannot let you go.zts1860e	Please. Reject the order of master.zts1861e	Sorry.. But I cannot.zts1862e	(Grrr) And then. Sorry for this.zts1863e	Brothers!! Arrest him!! Take his letter!!zts1864e	Gosh!!zts1865e	Hi!!zts1866e	Wow! You scared me!!zts1867e	Still so cute!! Haha!!zts1868e	I would like to save you.. but I can't. Somebody is chasing me.zts1869e	Haha. This place is not that bad though.zts1870e	You don't need to worry. Koaren and Catsy wants to reconcile.zts1871e	Haha.. I know.. My beauty and my loveliness can melt anyone's heart!! If the Kovolts are not blind, so will they!!zts1872e	(What a super optimistic girl she is!!)zts1873e	Hmm. are you also falling for me??zts1874e	Ah.. Anyway, I will meet the Rosebud Knights and then propose that they close the peace pact! Please wait for a while until then.zts1875e	What? Did Cenil come?zts1876e	Didn't you know?zts1877e	Cenil.. is noisy, picky.. and even boring!!zts1878e	Hmmm. I feel so bad. My knight. Just leave me alone. I am so down now.zts1879e	(She's beyond my patience.)zts1880e	What are you doing? I want to be alone..zts1881e	Kovolt 1: Stop there.zts1882e	Kovolt 2: You cannot get out of here!!zts1883e	Kovolt 3: It's the order of Kenel. Brothers, arrest him!!zts1884e	Kovolt 1: You don't give up!!zts1885e	Kovolt 2: But now it's over!!zts1886e	Kovolt 3: You can't escape here!!zts1887e	Stop it!zts1888e	Kovolt 1: Huh!zts1889e	Kovolt 2: Master!zts1890e	Do not disturb him anymore!!zts1891e	Krr. KrrKoaren!!zts1892e	Warrior! Now leave quickly. I hope you will be back with good news.zts1893e	KrrKoaren!! Thanks! And do not be anxious! I will persuade Cenil by all possible means!!zts1894e	Stop there!zts1895e	You just won't give up, will you?zts1896e	Please. Hand me the letter.zts1897e	No, no way!!zts1898e	I don't want to fight you. But!!zts1899e	Kovolt and Catsy can never be friends.zts1900e	Who are you??zts1901e	Ah.. You are Catsy!!zts1902e	I am looking for Cenil. I have to meet him.zts1903e	Huh.zts1904e	Aren't you from the company of Cenil?zts1905e	Umm.. What is the reason that you want to meet him?zts1906e	I have the letter from KrrKoaren! He wants to close the peace pact.zts1907e	KrrKoaren. a master of Koaren. Right?zts1908e	Right!zts1909e	Give me the letter!!zts1910e	By the way, who are you??zts1911e	My name is Patrisha de BlackCappuccino. Younger sister of Princess Charlotte. You can call me Patty.zts1912e	Ah. So you are. The princess was captured by the Kovolts. But do not worry, she is safe. Read this letter first.zts1913e	(Handed Patrisha the letter from KrrKoaren)zts1914e	According to what you said.zts1915e	Without this letter, the peace pact cannot be closed.zts1916e	(Patrisha tears the letter apart)zts1917e	Wh.. what are you doing!!zts1918e	As you saw.zts1919e	Your sister's life is in danger!!zts1920e	So what? What's the big deal?zts1921e	Hohohoho!!zts1922e	Who. Who on earth are you?!zts1923e	Princess Patrisha, sister of Princess Charlotte. Ahh!! Someone is coming here.. Hoho!! I will go. Bye!!zts1924e	Stop there!zts1925e	That is done. The letter has been torn apart already.zts1926e	What are you talking about?zts1927e	I don't know. A strange Catsy girl was coming up all of a sudden and.zts1928e	Hmmm.. Was it a Darksy?zts1929e	Yes. Yes??zts1930e	You don't know that. But the Catsies are divided into two groups. One is liberal and loves peace but the other one, called the Darksy are radical and violent. Of course, Darksy is far more dangerous.zts1931e	Anyways it is interesting!! Darksy is on my side.. Hahaha!zts1932e	I couldnt agree more.zts1933e	Who!! Who are you!! Where!!zts1934e	Are you wondering who I am? Even though you don't know who's on your side or on the other?zts1935e	You!!zts1936e	I am the princess of Catsy and the master of Darksy. Princess Patrisha de.zts1937e	Grrr..zts1938e	Kovolt Soup..zts1939e	I will kill you.zts1940e	You stinky Catsy.zts1941e	Huhu..zts1942e	(No.. I must not get involved in this fight. Let's get out of here, hurry up and find Cenil)zts1943e	Surely Cenil is around here. I have to find him and persuade him. If we succeed in making the peace pact between the Kovolts and the Catsies, then there is nothing that Kenel and Darksy can do.zts1944e	Cenil. Please listen up!zts1945e	Hmm.. Don't you value your life? How can you come here by yourself?zts1946e	Stop it! KrrKoaren. the master of Koaren wants to make a peace pact.zts1947e	Oh. Hohohoho!zts1948e	It's true. Believe me!!zts1949e	If you were me, would you believe?zts1950e	The hatred between the two species are beyond your imagination. It cannot be settled down with your persuasive words.zts1951e	What is so important about the grudge that you cannot even find the origin of?zts1952e	Its origin is forgotten easily as time goes by. But even though nobody remembers it, it doesn't mean that an origin is not there. Since we came to the world, we have hated the Catsies. Even though we don't know why.. But the hatred is still alive in our veins. If you say we have to reject that, it means..zts1953e	It means you're my enemy!!zts1954e	It will be over!!zts1955e	Hold on!! Cenil de Strawberrypie!zts1956e	Ahhh!! You are Patty?zts1957e	I have never allowed you to use this name.zts1958e	The title 'Princess' would never match a betrayer!!zts1959e	How can you call me a betrayer, even though you are against the will of Mother Erenia!!zts1960e	The heart and the lives of all the Catsies are coming from one source - Princess Charlotte. Everything other than that is considered betrayal.zts1961e	You didn't give up Charlotte. She's insane.zts1962e	Just tell me your brief message and leave now. Otherwise, I worry that I just might pierce your heart with my sword.zts1963e	You have become arrogant. It's okay. I'll tell you my message.zts1964e	Tie him up!!zts1965e	I have only one request.zts1966e	Why?zts1967e	Haha!!zts1968e	Why do I have to follow your orders?zts1969e	Otherwise, Charlotte may die.zts1970e	!!zts1971e	You don't seem to understand. You had a fight with KrrKoaren a few days ago.zts1972e	How dare you. What did you do to the Princess.zts1973e	HuHu.. It doesn't hurt anyone to obey me. Human! Follow me.zts1974e	Wh.. What 's the reason to save me?zts1975e	Do not be in a hurry to listen to the reason.zts1976e	I won't forgive you Patty. I will kill you.zts1977e	You will be safe here.zts1978e	Wh.. Why did you save me?zts1979e	Because I'm the one who wants to make peace with the Kovolts.zts1980e	What??zts1981e	Cenil hates Kovolts. His heart is full of hatred. If you had met him with the letter from KrrKoaren, you would not be alive now.zts1982e	Really!zts1983e	It's like flying to the fire.zts1984e	Then, why did you upset Kenel? Why did you fight him?zts1985e	Kenel smells of something.. tricky.. just like Cenil.zts1986e	I don't mind if it's Cenil or Kenel. I would make the peace pact with the Kovolts and will help them handle Fernon.zts1987e	Will you do it yourself?zts1988e	HuHuu..!! Do not underestimate a Darksy!!zts1989e	All of sudden, what are you doing?zts1990e	Ahh!! Not bad!!zts1991e	Why did you attack me?zts1992e	Sorry about that. I just wanted to see what skills you possess. Anyway, let me introduce myself. We are the best troop of the Darksies - the Blackshoes Knights!!zts1993e	Blackshoes Knights!!zts1994e	I'll go with them and meet KrrKoaren.zts1995e	But, why don't you go meet KrrKoaren directly?zts1996e	Because most Kovolts hate Catsies. But now I have the Blackshoes Knights, I am safe!zts1997e	Kovolt: Kaaa!!zts1998e	Oh, what is going on?zts1999e	Kovolt: Kenkos are here.zts2000e	Kovolt: KrrKoaren is in danger. Please, help him!!zts2001e	Kenel's men and the Rosebud Knights are fighting together!zts2002e	Stop! Stop it right now!!zts2003e	Why are you stopping me??zts2004e	What are you doing??zts2005e	This isn't the right time for this! KrrKoaren is in danger because of Kenko's attack!!zts2006e	Master??zts2007e	So what? What does it matter to me?zts2008e	It does matter to me!!zts2009e	Patrisha!! And Blackshoes Knights!!zts2010e	I'll handle this.. you take Kenel and find KrrKoaren!!zts2011e	I don't need the Catsy's help!!zts2012e	Kenel!! There's no time for this!zts2013e	There's no time for you!! Leave it to me! You must look for the master.zts2014e	Will it be okay?zts2015e	Hah! This is a piece of cake!zts2016e	What are you doing!!zts2017e	You are the Catsy who can handle seal magic?zts2018e	Let me go! Let me go!!zts2019e	Kenko.. Stop there!! That's enough!!zts2020e	Oh my knight! Do something!!zts2021e	Oh! You are quick!!zts2022e	It's over!! Give up!!zts2023e	The Demon snatches Charlotte and runs away.zts2024e	Ahhh!! Help me!!zts2025e	No!!zts2026e	It's good!! Hey human. I won't forget today!!zts2027e	Are you okay??zts2028e	Kovolt: Krr.. KrrKoaren. Please. Ahh.zts2029e	Gosh. He's dead.zts2030e	That's all right. It's not that serious.zts2031e	Oh Patrisha..zts2032e	Ummm.zts2033e	She is going to come by herself. Let's wait.zts2034e	By the way, where is Cenil?zts2035e	We drove him away. He was injured and will be quiet for the time being. By the way, where is Charlotte?zts2036e	Anything happened?zts2037e	Sorry, but she was kidnapped by Kenko.zts2038e	Oh my God!! No!! We have to find her by all means!!zts2039e	Um.zts2040e	Sister.zts2041e	By the way, Patrisha.zts2042e	Call me Patty.zts2043e	Ah.. Patty, why can't you get along with Cenil? Both of you seem to cherish Charlotte, right?zts2044e	Is there some reason you can't tell me?zts2045e	It's like the difference between Catsy and Darksy.. Haha..zts2046e	What do you mean?zts2047e	Well.. It's like we can't admit it to each other. But you may get me wrong at this moment, so let's stop here.zts2048e	Okay.zts2049e	Are you chasing Kenko too?zts2050e	Of course. I don't know why Kenko kidnapped Charlotte, but l do know it's not for a friendly chat!!zts2051e	Do you know the reason then?zts2052e	Do you know Charlotte has the power to seal Fernon?zts2053e	So?zts2054e	The reverse is also possible.zts2055e	Okay, let's work together for time being. Finding her is our first priority now.zts2056e	Catsy, what are you?zts2057e	My name is Patrisha de Blackcapuccino, Princess of Darksy and head of the Blackshoes Knights.zts2058e	You saved me?zts2059e	Probably.zts2060e	For what?zts2061e	To cut off the history of grudge between our two species.zts2062e	As a gift of reconciliation.zts2063e	Hmm.zts2064e	I will give you the life of GrrKenko.zts2065e	What if I reject it?zts2066e	Do you think I will compromise with Catsy to save myself and my people?zts2067e	But if it's the only way to save you and your brothers.zts2068e	Now, I guess the reconciliation is accepted. Now, I will leave. byezts2069e	Wait!zts2070e	Kenko's troops are approaching now.zts2071e	Ah.zts2072e	As a return gift, I will protect you from them!!zts2073e	Patrisha: It's my honor. Huhu.zts2074e	But.. it is beyond my power. Can I use the power of the Blackshoes Knights?zts2075e	Of course.zts2076e	Here is the way down.zts2077e	(Sigh!!) . Finally we found it!!zts2078e	Oho!! .. Cenil.zts2079e	Haha.. Is that you? Patty?zts2080e	You better watch your mouth. I don't forget unpleasant memories so easily. Don't remind me.zts2081e	Huhu.. I don't have to show respect to anyone who betrays the Princess.zts2082e	No.. No.. Stop it.zts2083e	Let's not waste precious time arguing. Saving her is of utmost importance now.zts2084e	Will. you go together?zts2085e	Hmm. Okay but only because the Princess is in danger. However!zts2086e	Go ahead.zts2087e	After we save her highness, I cannot promise that the life of that human will be safe.zts2088e	Okay, as you wish.zts2089e	What.. what are you talking about?zts2090e	Hey.. Dirty Kovolts.. Bring it on!!zts2091e	Hmm.. We have to go through it.zts2092e	They are too many. We can't waste anymore time here. Let's leave it to the Rosebud Knights.zts2093e	You don't have to explain everything in detail. Just give us an order!!zts2094e	You brave Rosebud Knights, stay here and show those dirty Kovolts how ruthless we can be! Don't leave even one of them alive!!zts2095e	Knights: In the name of Rosebud!!zts2096e	I found the way down!zts2097e	I can feel it. We will meet the princess soon!!zts2098e	Hey.. stinky cats!! Everyone!! Attack Catsy!!zts2099e	Kenel!! Stop it!!zts2100e	Hahaha.. As you wish, I will take over your life.zts2101e	No!!zts2102e	Hey kid. Don't disturb.zts2103e	No.. Never.. I cannot allow you to kill Kenel.zts2104e	Get out of my way. If I am doomed to be defeated, I will gladly accept it. I won't kneel down to a stinky cat to save my life.zts2105e	Haha. You talk so well, dirty Kovolt!zts2106e	Cenil. Stop it!zts2107e	Patty, stay away from this! It's not your business.zts2108e	On behalf of Darksy and Kovolt, KrrKoaren and I have made the peace pact. If Catsy attacks Kovolt, I won't accept it!!zts2109e	What? This. dir.. dirty!zts2110e	Majesty.. Oh.. my majesty, he finally.. (Sobbing)zts2111e	Kenel.. You are also chasing Kenko, right? Then why don't you work together?zts2112e	I can't get along with. Ka. Catsy!!zts2113e	What if this is the will of KrrKoaren?zts2114e	Ok. Let's decide it. Now, hurry up. We can catch up with Kenko soon!!zts2115e	Yes.. I can feel it.. the heartbeat of the princess!!zts2116e	Kenel. Where are we now?zts2117e	KrrKoaren wanted to reconcile with us. So, be friendly to him.zts2118e	Here below us, is the bottom of Shanera Dungeon.zts2119e	Go ahead.zts2120e	This place smells like Demons!!zts2121e	Four of them lead to disaster and only one is the pathway to life. Whoever finds this path can overcome me.zts2122e	What does it mean?zts2123e	Go through 8 hills. Keep in mind that I have little patience.zts2124e	Ah.. Here is the maze of pain!!zts2125e	Maze of pain?zts2126e	People say that they can get out of here only if they accomplish 5 missions. It's a place of legend. Hmm. Interesting.zts2127e	Pain is my middle name. Bear it and survive it.zts2128e	Enemies are coming!!zts2129e	Swear at the shining sword, in the name of honor!zts2130e	Watch out. Something huge is coming!zts2131e	Sink in desperation and give up. Only despair will save your life.zts2132e	Wh.. where are we??zts2133e	Hmm.. You guys are smarter than I thought. I didn't expect to meet you here.zts2134e	Give back Charlotte!!zts2135e	The ritual has already begun. You are too late for the show.. Haha!!zts2136e	Fernon will awake soon, and the closed TimeSpace will be torn into pieces. And then, the way will be opened.zts2137e	This.. villain!!zts2138e	Shout as much as you want!! But it has already begun. Praise the Demon and respect his plan.zts2139e	The Demon is disappearing!. Does it mean that everything is over?zts2140e	We cannot give up now!! Let's find Kenko and save Charlotte!!zts2141e	Patty. I have to tell you something.zts2142e	Why? Why do you want to save Charlotte?zts2143e	What do you mean? Of course, we have to.zts2144e	Hmm. You don't know yet. Darksy does.zts2145e	Cenil. Shut up! Stop it!zts2146e	They have to know about this.. Miss Liar??zts2147e	Don't entrap me!zts2148e	I am not entrapping you. But you know that Darksy wants Fernon to be reborn.zts2149e	Grrrrrr!!zts2150e	And then, why do you try to save Charlotte? I think you are the person who desperately awaits the ritual.zts2151e	Don't jump to conclusions. What I want.. No.. What the Darksy wants is the will of Mother Erenia. She wants to communicate with the world. Fernon is a gift from her and with her blessing, it will wake up from deep slumber!zts2152e	(Sigh!!) .. and then why did you try to block Kenko? I don't understand you. I refuse to go with you any more!zts2153e	It's not like that. The Demons are not giving rebirth to Fernon. They are changing Fernon into a tree of the Devil. It will make a pathway for the Demons in Hellrod to pass through.zts2154e	However, if Fernon is opened, everything else will be the same in the long run. Did you know that!!zts2155e	No, it's different!! The original Fernon doesn't have any Devil power, and doesn't hurt any life!zts2156e	Haha. You Darksies. Always twisting and distorting the truth. I will leave here, but I promise you one thing. The next time I see you. My sword will be aimed at your throat. Hahaha. Bye.zts2157e	I.. I don't know. But let me ask you one question.. Do you really want to save Charlotte?zts2158e	Of course.zts2159e	If so.. if you really do, then I will follow you. Kenel, What about you?zts2160e	My master has ordered so.. I have to follow it.zts2161e	It doesn't have any end!!zts2162e	Let's get out of here now!! Hurry up. We have to find Kenko first!!zts2163e	Here you come!!zts2164e	Where is Charlotte?zts2165e	She's in the ritual. It is already started.zts2166e	Kenko!! Why did you betray us? Why have you thrown away your pride?zts2167e	.. I didn't have any other choice. Our land, Kreano, was already taken over by the Demons. In order to survive, I had to follow their orders.zts2168e	What.. What?zts2169e	Hate me. Kill me. Even though I die here, I deserve to be cursed. However!zts2170e	Get out of my way.. You betrayer!!zts2171e	No, I can't.. For the sake of my brothers, I can't show you the way.zts2172e	If that is so, then all of us will die!!zts2173e	None of you can enter until the ritual is over!!zts2174e	(Grrrrr) Betrayer! Why didn't you expect this?zts2175e	I have one thing to ask for!!zts2176e	Please don't kill my brothers.. They are innocent..zts2177e	Okay..

Is Fernon sealed?zts2211e	No.. it's just falling asleep again.zts2212e	Then why don't you seal it? Hurry. Begin the sealing ritual!zts2213e	It's too late to seal it. Fernon awakes with the blood of the Kovolts and sleeps with the blood of the Catsy. Now it has tasted both and will move of its own will. There's nothing we can do from now on.zts2214e	Does that means sometime later.. it will wake up again?zts2215e	Don't worry. If it's not the Fernon of Devil power, it won't hurt any life.zts2216e	But, even so, all the pathways in the worlds will be opened and the world will plunge into chaos.zts2217e	It is.. it is the will of Mother Erenia.zts2218e	Well.. we don't know who's right.. and who's wrong now.zts2219e	One thing sure is.. a new age is coming.zts2220e	(Cenil. I kept the promise)zts2221e	Hey.. Brother. What did you say?zts2222e	No.. Nothing.. I didn't say anything.zts2223e	Was our adventure a success or a failure? Only vanity and sorrow are left. Many died, but nobody knows who were on the side of justice. Fernon.. Are you the will of Mother Erenia or the symbol of Devil power?zts2224e	Pajama Quest Start 1zts2225e	It's a Soul gem to get a Pajama card.zts2226e	Ah..

I was cursed by a wicked witch and then..zts2338e	Hmm.. really?zts2339e	Yes, I lost my memory and became the fairy of pajamas for the last 100 years. I think I have done a lot of vicious things.zts2340e	Ahh.. headache.. What is happening here?zts2341e	Thanks again, Hero. You punished the wicked witch and released me from my curse. Please accept this gift from me.zts2342e	Ah. this card is.zts2343e	It's a pajama card! It will bring you luck. Now it's time to bid farewell.

A thousand years have passed since I saw the last face.zts2359e	Who are you?zts2360e	I used to be a human like you. However, I am now a ghost in anger.zts2361e	I won't forget the gratitude I owe you sweety.. However..zts2362e	However, what?zts2363e	I cannot disappear like this.zts2364e	Sorry, but I have to use you for the time being. When the wheel of my revenge stops, you will be free.zts2365e	What? What are you doing?!zts2366e	The adventurer feels dizzy and later regains consciousness. He looks around but does not find anyone. When he looks down, he finds the piece of TimeSpace.zts2367e	Warrior (Voice) : Sorry. Because of my grudge, you will lose your vitality slowly. Please cut off the chain of my grudge. Find Dark Stalin, the vicious elf. Only his blood can save us!zts2368e	(Talk to the Soul gem again and enter TimeSpace)zts2369e	Warrior Quest middle Conversation 1zts2370e	..

If I had my bow and arrow in my hands, you would be already dead, Mr.Jerk.zts2385e	Don't you think you speak too harshly?zts2386e	You haven't changed a bit. Now the time to pay back has come.zts2387e	Haha.. There's no need to bring old memories back. Let's have a long sleep again.zts2388e	Have you lost the pride and honor of a warrior?zts2389e	No, but I'm just sick of killing without a reason.zts2390e	A thousand years in the darkness. Doesn't this make you angry? Do you want to forgive those vicious elves?zts2391e	Well, the first one hundred years was very boring, but I started getting used to it.zts2392e	Don't avoid the question, my friend. Answer me!zts2393e	Have you forgotten everything? We fought against the cursed Dark Stalin and lost. Why did we lose? It's because we were stupid. And now, since a thousand years have passed, what more can we do?zts2394e	That vicious elf was afraid of our power, and killed himself and trapped us in his body. Our souls have been restrained in a thousand years of darkness. It's so shameful. If we cannot take revenge, we don't deserve a peaceful death.zts2395e	Haha.. So who are you fighting now? The innocent descendants of the elf?zts2396e	Dark Stalin. He is still alive.zts2397e	Haha.. this is a funny story.zts2398e	I was sealed in his head and heard the whole truth. He didn't die, but just sealed us in his body.zts2399e	He has lost his body, but he's still alive. And now, both of us are alive again. We have to kick his butt!zts2400e	Oh.zts2401e	He has regained two thirds of his body back already.zts2402e	If you don't like it, you don't have to join.zts2403e	Well, that sounds alright.zts2404e	I want to see his face.zts2405e	Haha..zts2406e	Hey, you little man!zts2407e	Yes?zts2408e	Take it and find his flesh and bones!zts2409e	A piece of TimeSpace was thrown at the feet.zts2410e	The flesh and bones of Dark Stalin?zts2411e	Haha.. If you go there, you will come to know naturally.zts2412e	Warrior Quest middle Conversation 3zts2413e	Don't talk to me without a reason.zts2414e	Warrior Quest start Conversation 3zts2415e	I found this old, shabby sword.zts2416e	Oh, this is..zts2417e	Yes. It was made of his flesh and bones. Now, let's bring him back.zts2418e	A strange beam is coming out!zts2419e	Dark Stalin! You cursed elf! I will kill you! I will burn you and cut you up into pieces!zts2420e	Hey buddy, calm down.zts2421e	Haha.. after a thousand years, you still haven't changed a bit.zts2422e	What has happened to me? Has it really been a thousand years?zts2423e	Okay, I will explain everything. So just calm down.zts2424e	You know Dark Stalin, right? The cursed thief. Where is he? I will kill him and chop him into pieces. I will burn him to ashes and blow it away from the top of a mountain.zts2425e	Haha.. okay, that's enough. Shut up. We will meet him soon.zts2426e	Already.. the head, heart, flesh and bones of Dark Stalin flock together.zts2427e	A beam emanates from the head, heart and sword respectively. The three beams come together and become one. And then, something drops to the ground. This is..zts2428e	Piece!zts2429e	Finally, we can see his face. Now, you little warrior..zts2430e	This is your last mission. Give way to us!zts2431e	Way? What do you mean?zts2432e	That piece will lead us. Now, give way for us to pass.zts2433e	I will melt your flesh to the bones, Dark Stalin.zts2434e	Warrior Quest middle TimeSpacezts2435e	Long time no see, filthy elf!zts2436e	Dark Stalin: ..zts2437e	I will slay you! Fireball!zts2438e	Stop it. Calm down.zts2439e	Don't interrupt me. I will release a thousand-year grudge here.zts2440e	Dark Stalin: Yes, kill me.zts2441e	.. Do you have any last words before you die?zts2442e	The past one thousand years.. It has been long and tiring. I am fed up with it now.zts2443e	Fireball!! Hey, why do you bother me?zts2444e	I told you not to take immediate action!zts2445e	Dark Stalin: Haha.. Everything will end with my death. So don't argue with each other.zts2446e	Why? Why did you imprison us for a thousand years?zts2447e	Dark Stalin: You killed so many of our tribesmen. I was afraid of your power.zts2448e	It was you who attacked first!zts2449e	Dark Stalin: Suppose we didn't attack you, then do you think we could've avoided the war?zts2450e	Dark Stalin: We also suffered through difficult times. Everything was for our survival.zts2451e	Dark Stalin: So, I sealed you.. Nothing personal you know.zts2452e	Dark Stalin: That's all. Kill me now.zts2453e	Why hesitate? Do it now!zts2454e	Why are you smiling?zts2455e	Well.. It's not funny anymore. Let's leave.zts2456e	What?? Are you insane?!zts2457e	It's all over. I just want to see Dark Stalin's face. Now, let's go back. This world is for the living.zts2458e	Let's return.zts2459e	What? Why are you doing this?zts2460e	He doesn't have any family to protect, no passion for life. He only has a desire to rest.zts2461e	No, I don't understand. What do you mean?zts2462e	I don't want to bother giving the piece to him.zts2463e	What does it mean?.. Ah!zts2464e	You idiot!zts2465e	Hey, Dark Stalin!zts2466e	A thousand years of suffering.zts2467e	Now, much suffering will come your way.zts2468e	Warrior Quest Endingzts2469e	Thanks, little warrior!zts2470e	Watch your mouth!!zts2471e	Gosh!!

But what are you doing here? What are these flowers for?zts2482e	Ah.. They are lilies. If I collect a thousand lilies, he will return.zts2483e	He.. Hmm. interesting.zts2484e	I put my heart into these lilies. If I collect a thousand of them, he will surely come back, even if he has a stone-cold heart.zts2485e	Ah, I see.zts2486e	Now, I have only a hundred left to collect, but some of them keep disappearing. I have no idea why.zts2487e	Hmm. strange. Can I help you?zts2488e	You need only a thousand lilies, right?zts2489e	Yes, but I don't want to bother you.zts2490e	No, no problem.zts2491e	Sorcerer Quest middle Conversationzts2492e	I feel relaxed with the lilies.zts2493e	Sorcerer Quest Start 2zts2494e	Here you go.. one thousand lilies.zts2495e	Thanks..

I gather them over and over, but can't make one thousand.zts2502e	How can it be possible?zts2503e	I don't know. Probably someone prevents me from meeting him.zts2504e	Uh.. someone is here. Hey, who is it?zts2505e	Who the hell are you?zts2506e	You.. you are the thief! You robbed the lilies, right?zts2507e	That person hid in the shadows and disappeared.zts2508e	Where is he?zts2509e	He ran away to the chasm of TimeSpace.

I don't know.. why..zts2529e	Please, don't ask me that. Yes, he was killed by my own hands. I am an assassin with a cold heart. I have to complete the job, as my client requests, but he is so..zts2530e	He is such a great person. I wish to help him. Please..zts2531e	Why did you take the flower?zts2532e	These flowers cannot bring him back. If she knows that one thousand lilies can't cause the miracle, and then she will become desperate.zts2533e	Now, he's arrested in the horrible place. I can't do anything there with my weak powers. But you are stronger than me. Help me. Please.zts2534e	A beam coming out of a finger.

I have already died before, so it's not painful.zts2580e	You know it is not as you said.zts2581e	I.. loved the miss.zts2582e	So.. when I got the order to kill the master, I could give it up and instead could have killed myself. No.. I could have even ran away to avoid the order.zts2583e	And, who gave you the order?zts2584e	The master's uncle.zts2585e	I'm not sure why.. but that uncle.. he isn't human.zts2586e	How could he give that order?zts2587e	Because he's the leader of our team.zts2588e	Don't think about it too much. Anyway, I killed my master, with the excuse of following the order.zts2589e	Hmm..zts2590e	No.. I don't know. Do you think, if I hadn't loved her, I wouldn't have stabbed him?zts2591e	Argh..

For master? For miss? On earth..zts2606e	You are terminated!zts2607e	PsychoDemon: Hahaha..zts2608e	You insulted the love of these people.

What are you talking about?zts2615e	PsychoDemon: Do you have a good reason to go hunting? Have you ever cried over the death of innocent animals?zts2616e	..zts2617e	PsychoDemon: At that time, I was fatally hurt and his uncle saved me. But I am a Demon and I have my own ways of survival. I ate him up and then fed myself with his family. Finally, I could survive.zts2618e	They rescued and restored you with hospitality. How could you return their love like this? You Demon.zts2619e	PsychoDemon: Exactly. Hey, love and affection are your values. I am a Demon.zts2620e	PsychoDemon: I will die soon, because you are too strong and I know I can't beat you. Do you think I will hate you for that?zts2621e	PsychoDemon: Haha.. It is a Demon.zts2622e	You just die..zts2623e	Hurry up! For me, truth is most important!zts2624e	So, did he escape?zts2625e	Tell me!zts2626e	To be honest with you!zts2627e	The story? The adventurer spoke about the death of the assassin.

Die..!!zts2814e	The huge Mandragora disappears and a dim light shines from the inside. It's a ghost!zts2815e	Whhhooooo.zts2816e	Who.. Who are you??zts2817e	Hooo. So much time has passed.zts2818e	And nobody remembers us.zts2819e	..zts2820e	I was a farmer in Milano 200 years ago.zts2821e	I don't understand.zts2822e	200 years ago, the Lopello family dug out all the fields of ginseng and built mines.zts2823e	We couldn't stand it, so we began fighting, but we were eventually defeated.zts2824e	Lopello's guards killed us and buried us all here, but we can't leave this world until our souls are given what they deserve.. peace.zts2825e	That means.zts2826e	Yes.. The Mandragoras are creatures created from our thirst for vengeance.zts2827e	But thanks to you, we are now free from the curse.zts2828e	I didn't.. Didn't intend to..zts2829e	No.. Your bravery has saved us.

I will do my best!zts2835e	Thank you brave adventurer, please take this.zts2836e	Xysenload, have you heard about this?zts2837e	It's a formidable monster formed from the grudge of farmer victims. You can't beat it by yourself. Please make a team and unite your powers. If heroes like you can cooperate, you can surely terminate it. Save the other poor souls.zts2838e	Yes, I promise. I will save your friends!zts2839e	Thank you. Thank you so much.zts2840e	This is the forbidden altar. Nobody is allowed to touch it.zts2841e	I..

Ain't that cool!zts2852e	5 years? Are you kidding? We can't get anything here, not even a drop of water or food!!zts2853e	You idiot! This is the room of eternity. We don't have to eat or sleep. We can't even die here because we are not getting old!zts2854e	No way. That's unreasonable!!zts2855e	Hey! I am a witness. Well, it's not extremely bad, except that it's very boring.zts2856e	Oh. Gosh!zts2857e	Anyway, let's get along with each other, my new buddy!zts2858e	Don't say that! I will escape from here by all means!!zts2859e	Hahaha. Hahahaha!zts2860e	Don't laugh at me!zts2861e	It's a closed space, but at the same time, it's open.zts2862e	What do you mean?zts2863e	Here!!zts2864e	A portal has opened at the direction the Catsy showed!!zts2865e	If you don't believe me, try it!zts2866e	Hmm.. it doesn't seem to have any end.zts2867e	So, just give up!!zts2868e	You!!zts2869e	Follow me.zts2870e	Give up. I made this room out of a magic field without any exit.zts2871e	The real room of eternity is over there. It's filled with huge Devils. I created this to protect myself.zts2872e	You. You are hopeless.zts2873e	At least, we are safe here. forever.zts2874e	No!! It can't be. Save me. Get me out of here!!zts2875e	(Monologue) Whenever l look back on the past, it isn't that bad, except for being bored. 5 years of time passed aimlessly. Now, what is coming to us.

Like you, my curiosity killed me. Hahaha.zts2882e	Nobody can get out of this room. I, too, have been grounded here for the last 5 years. Ain't that cool!zts2883e	5 years? Are you kidding? Even I, the strongest Kovolt warrior, can't bear it for that long!!zts2884e	You idiot! This is the room of eternity. We don't have to eat or sleep. We can't even die here because we are not getting old!zts2885e	Say something reasonable!!zts2886e	Hey! I am a witness. Well, it's not extremely bad, except that it's very boring.zts2887e	Anyway, let's be good friends!!zts2888e	Don't say that! I will escape from here by all means!!zts2889e	Don't laugh at me!zts2890e	Hahaha. Hahahaha!zts2891e	You dirty Kovolt. This is a closed place, but at the same time, it's open.zts2892e	Ah.

You!!zts2896e	Okay.. follow me!zts2897e	(Monologue) Whenever l look back on the past, it isn't that bad, except for being bored. 5 years of time passed aimlessly. Now, what is coming to us. Uh??zts2898e	Shut up!zts2899e	So. Sorry.zts2900e	Don't do that. Now, it's time for even the newest buddy to be depressed.zts2901e	Haha. Probably. Time goes so fast.zts2902e	Kung!! (Falling sound)zts2903e	What is this? Why is everything being repeated?zts2904e	??: Ouch.zts2905e	You guys stay here. I will go and check it out!zts2906e	Hmm. as I expected. A human, a Kovolt and a Catsy.zts2907e	Who are you?zts2908e	You useless humble life. Take back your stupid question!!zts2909e	Let's terminate him!zts2910e	You can say that again!!zts2911e	Okay.. All.. Attack!zts2912e	Huh!!zts2913e	Let me finish him!!zts2914e	No.. Stop it.. He knows something about us!zts2915e	Okay. Then, let us listen. Tell us what you know.zts2916e	What do you mean 'expect'?zts2917e	What do you know about us?zts2918e	If you don't open your mouth, we will kill you.zts2919e	Kill me!zts2920e	No. No. No. Let's calm down!zts2921e	Haha.. We Demons are not like you. We never beg for the life.zts2922e	So, let's finish him!zts2923e	No, stop it. Hey Demon. Is there any reason why we can't know the truth?zts2924e	Haha.. not really.zts2925e	And then, spill it. Tell the truth.zts2926e	This place is..zts2927e	Don't hesitate!zts2928e	Hey, stinky Kovolt! Get out of my face.zts2929e	What? You!!zts2930e	Hey.. Stop it.. Okay?zts2931e	Anyway.. this place is the grave of DarkCastra.zts2932e	DarkCastra?zts2933e	DarkCastra will wake up soon and you will be a victim for his resurrection.zts2934e	What?zts2935e	You idiot! 3 species and 15 years. It's the key to break the door open. Now, DarkCastra is coming.zts2936e	Oh. DarkCastra.zts2937e	What is that?zts2938e	An insane wizard.zts2939e	That's all?zts2940e	I don't know more than that.zts2941e	A wizard that went insane. He will destroy the whole world, that's all.zts2942e	Oh.. my..zts2943e	By the way, what brought you here?zts2944e	I came to see the ritual break the door. I expected to have some fun today.. But didn't expect such strong resistance. It was my mistake.zts2945e	If the ritual is over, what will happen to us?zts2946e	No need to say.zts2947e	Answer me! I asked you what would happen to us?zts2948e	I don't need you anymore. So, after that, it's your decision.zts2949e	Oh.. that means 15 years of imprisonment will be over?zts2950e	(Giggle)zts2951e	Hey.. what do you think about it now?zts2952e	Be quiet. Hey Demon, how many years have passed in the outside world?zts2953e	Here 5 years is equal to 1 day outside.zts2954e	Oh.. Really?zts2955e	What do you have in mind anyway?zts2956e	Go on.. Continue that ritual.zts2957e	What? Are you insane?zts2958e	(Giggle) Now, I can say good bye to this place.zts2959e	You said if DarkCastra wakes up, the world would be in big trouble!zts2960e	Yes.. So what?zts2961e	What? What do you mean?zts2962e	I don't care for world peace.. Just give it to a dog if you want it. For me, my freedom is more important.zts2963e	If we can't get out of here, the fact that the world is in peace or in danger, is meaningless to us. Right? Use you brain like me.zts2964e	(Giggle) If you keep bothering us, we will force you with our power and leave here!!zts2965e	Shoot.zts2966e	Hey.. Demon. Keep going.zts2967e	Haha.. If you decide, follow me!!zts2968e	Now. We are almost there!!zts2969e	Here.zts2970e	Go ahead!!zts2971e	(Giggle!!)zts2972e	Hey.. please!!zts2973e	The Demon starts emitting a light and everyone starts passing out slowly. Hmm.. where are we?zts2974e	Uh. Where. Where am I?zts2975e	It's your world.zts2976e	Ah.. the door was broken?zts2977e	Yes.. Haha..zts2978e	Shoot.zts2979e	If you want to protect the world, kill DarkCastra.zts2980e	If that's so. Where's DarkCastra?zts2981e	Take it.zts2982e	What is this?zts2983e	It will lead you to DarkCastra. You can't kill it for yourself, but if you can collect these other idiots, then you may be able to do it.zts2984e	Why.. why are you helping me? I thought you wanted the world to be destroyed.zts2985e	The Demon doesn't like Soul Erenia. No.. East mile is to be destroyed.zts2986e	You are not our enemy. So, don't worry. You only have to show us that you are suffering from chaos, betrayal and pain.zts2987e	What?zts2988e	Hahahaha.zts2989e	(The Demon disappears with smoke. Everything looks like a daydream.)zts2990e	A swarm of spiders are attacking. Can we escape?zts2991e	What. What is this.zts2992e	Here we are.zts2993e	Ah.. KrrKoaren.. What are you doing here?zts2994e	Nowadays. Spiders come up to Mt. Krem and prey on the Kovolts. Hmm. It was never this bad before.zts2995e	Yes. And here it looks very dangerous.zts2996e	It's all surrounded by spiders. You'd better be careful.zts2997e	I have a feeling that we are going over the same tracks again and again. I mean like a circle..zts2998e	Too many spiders. Well.. I don't know if we can even escape here alive.zts2999e	Watch out. Enemies!!zts3000e	I can't. Not anymore.zts3001e	Shoot. If I have warriors of Koaren.zts3002e	Why?? Do you have any idea?zts3003e	Not much. But.zts3004e	I will handle them. So, you escape first!zts3005e	What do you mean? I know what honor is.zts3006e	No.. Just listen. You get out of here and bring the Korean Warriors. It's the only way for all of us to survive.zts3007e	No. I can't!zts3008e	And then, both of us will die!zts3009e	Shoot.zts3010e	Please!!zts3011e	Okay.. I shall go. I won't forget your bravery. Hang in there. I will definitely come back for you all.zts3012e	Shoot. I don't think I can hold them back anymore.zts3013e	All creepy, hairy, smelly spiders everywhere!!zts3014e	KrrKoaren!!zts3015e	Oh. You human. You still alive!!zts3016e	Kenel, too!!zts3017e	Now, let's get out of here. Hurry up!zts3018e	You've gone through hard times.zts3019e	No, not at all, anyway, we were so lucky!zts3020e	As we inspected, there is a Queen spider somewhere in this cave.zts3021e	Queen spider?zts3022e	Yes.. all the spiders strolling around Mt. Krem are coming from her, the Queen spider.zts3023e	Then, we have to kill her.zts3024e	Yes, but the problem is how to access her. She is protected by gigantic soldier spiders. It's not easy.zts3025e	I will help you!zts3026e	Okay. Now, here Korean troops will wipe out the spiders.zts3027e	But where is the spider nest?zts3028e	Look at this stone.zts3029e	Get a piece of TimeSpace!!zts3030e	This is a piece of TimeSpace!!zts3031e	With this, we can find the Queen spider. Let's go!!zts3032e	My brother Koreans.. Wipe out those vicious bugs!!zts3033e	Kovolt 1: They are retreating!!zts3034e	Chase them. Don't let them escape alive!!zts3035e	Master!! I feel something strange. Don't you think it's too easy?zts3036e	What do you mean? They just got scared by seeing our troops. Everyone!! Chase them to the end!!zts3037e	Master!! It's weird. They disappeared all of a sudden!!zts3038e	What? Search around!! They can't simply disappear.zts3039e	It's a trap. The Spiders are coming from all directions. We have to retreat now!!zts3040e	Shoot. I can't a find any way out!!zts3041e	Watch out. It's coming!!zts3042e	Master. Master. It's too dangerous. Please run away!!zts3043e	You. foolish human beings.zts3044e	Who?zts3045e	You will be punished just like you tormented my family.zts3046e	The Spider talks? No. That's not possible!!zts3047e	You dirty bug. Show up. Where are you?zts3048e	Your body will nourish our babies. This is an honor for you. Pssh. Pssh.zts3049e	You can't come to me, nor die. Mother of all spiders. Jack Spider doesn't want your life, nor does it want to meet you.zts3050e	Cut the crap, and just come out!!zts3051e	Never forget the shame of today.zts3052e	Master!! Master!!zts3053e	Ukkk. What happened?zts3054e	I don't know.. When we came back to ourselves, we were here.zts3055e	What about our brothers?zts3056e	Only 3 of us survived.zts3057e	It's so scary.zts3058e	Yes. it's such a formidable monster!zts3059e	I will seal the entrance of the cave at once.zts3060e	But, will it make a difference?zts3061e	However, it's too dangerous to open it.zts3062e	How. How will you seal it?zts3063e	I will cut off the alley to this place.zts3064e	Hmm. Kenel.zts3065e	Tell me.zts3066e	Give me one more chance.zts3067e	What chance?zts3068e	I can't forgive Jack Spider, Queen Spider.zts3069e	I don't reject sealing the entrance. But, can you allow me to fight her again?zts3070e	It's too dangerous.zts3071e	I know. I can't make it by myself. But I don't want to step back here. In the name of Milano, I wish to try it again!!zts3072e	And then, you have to promise me one thing!!zts3073e	Yes. Tell me.zts3074e	Never. Never try it alone.zts3075e	Yes. I won't. Thanks.zts3076e	Kenel: Now, take it.zts3077e	As I said, we will block the alley. This sealing stone will lead you to the monster.zts3078e	Yes.zts3079e	Promise me you will be careful.zts3080e	Where. Where am I?zts3081e	??: Don't interrupt our slumber.zts3082e	Slade: Please don't disturb our slumber.zts3083e	I've not seen these Devils. I'd better get out of here.zts3084e	You.. You again??zts3085e	Slade: Please don't disturb our slumber.zts3086e	Who on earth are you!zts3087e	Slade Priest: We are the Slade species of ancient times. Don't awaken us you.. yo..zts3088e	Slade?zts3089e	Slade Priest: Our pain, our sadness.. We have buried all of them. So, don't irritate us any more.zts3090e	I wish to get out of here too, but can't find an exit!!zts3091e	Slade Priest: Do not disturb our slumber.zts3092e	Hey!zts3093e	Slade Priest: Anyone who awakens us has to compensate for it with their life!!zts3094e	What is this?zts3095e	What the heck is this?zts3096e	This is a sculpture.zts3097e	Slade Sculpture: Slade is the tribe of ancient times.zts3098e	Gosh!! The sculpture is talking!!zts3099e	Slade Sculpture: Slades are faithful slaves of Mother Ancelloan.zts3100e	Ancelloan?? The ancient Goddess of legend?zts3101e	Slade Sculpture: Ancelloan.. Mother of Erenia. The creator and master of this world.zts3102e	You. Are you really a sculpture?zts3103e	Slade Sculpture: Mother Ancelloan represents Slade. Her death is the death of Slade.zts3104e	Sound like he's murmuring all to himself.zts3105e	Slade Sculpture: Slade is dead, but our sadness is still alive. Sladeheim will come. Sladeheim will mourn for the death of Ancelloan forever.zts3106e	Sladeheim?zts3107e	Slade Sculpture : We curse you and this world. Die.. You die.. All of you die.. All of you terminated.. All of you have to follow the doom of Sladeheim!!zts3108e	Gravestone is also.zts3109e	Now.. It doesn't have an end!!zts3110e	Demon: You. Human. Follow me!zts3111e	Exit!!zts3112e	Why did you save me?zts3113e	Demon: Human.. Do you want to get out of here?zts3114e	Yes.zts3115e	Demon: I can help you then.zts3116e	How??zts3117e	Demon: With only one condition.zts3118e	What do you want from me?zts3119e	Demon: Take this stone.zts3120e	Demon: Sealing stone of Slade.zts3121e	Then, why do you give it to me?zts3122e	Demon: With this, enter the land of darkness.. And destroy the gravestone there.zts3123e	Is that the condition?zts3124e	Demon: If the stone is destroyed, this space will be twisted and you will be pushed out of that chasm.zts3125e	And then, what do you want on earth?zts3126e	Demon: My condition follows next. Will you do it?zts3127e	Demon: Decide now. Will you do it?zts3128e	If I follow your order, what will happen to the world?zts3129e	Demon: Well.zts3130e	Demon: Only one thing is sure.zts3131e	Demon: The future of you human beings is beyond my interest. I don't care what happens to you.zts3132e	And then, what do you want?zts3133e	Demon: Put a sleep on the ancient chaos, and we will replace it.zts3134e	If it is of any harm to the world, I won't do it!zts3135e	Demon: What if not?zts3136e	What do you mean?zts3137e	Demon: What if you can save the world with this?zts3138e	Demon: Will you or won't you do it?zts3139e	Don't cheat me.zts3140e	Demon: The Great Demon never tells a lie. I am not like you.zts3141e	Demon: Decide now!!zts3142e	Make it clear. For this world, do I have to do it or not?zts3143e	Demon: Both are right and both are wrong.zts3144e	What the heck is that?zts3145e	Demon: Now, make a decision immediately. Yes or no?zts3146e	Okay. I will do it.zts3147e	Demon: Then, leave now. Give sleep to the ancient chaos!!zts3148e	With the lights, portal is being opened!!zts3149e	Demon: Now. the trace of Slade will be washed away.zts3150e	Tell me..! Slade tribe.. Is it an enemy to the human beings?zts3151e	Demon: No.. It's just an ancient tribe sleeping with sadness.zts3152e	And then, why have you made me do this?zts3153e	Demon: To awaken Sladeheim.zts3154e	Demon: Now, because the Slade is terminated. Their despair will cause the gigantic monster Sladeheim to open its eyes.zts3155e	What do you mean?zts3156e	Demon: Sladeheim's despair will destroy the world!!zts3157e	What??zts3158e	Demon: The human beings are powerless in front of Sladeheim.. Sladeheim destroys, kills and takes everything back to nothing!!zts3159e	You dirty Demon.. You deceived me!!zts3160e	Demon: A Demon doesn't tell a lie.zts3161e	Demon: Sladeheim will wake up anyway. Of course, if untouched, it will wake up sometime later. But the later it wakes up, the more power it will have and then.. even God cannot control him.zts3162e	Demon: If so, you human beings better fight the young Sladeheim when it has less despair.zts3163e	Demon: Now, you will face the enemy 10,000 years in the future. So, I didn't lie to you!!zts3164e	You. You..zts3165e	Demon: Come on, it was your decision. Now, take responsibility for it. And for this, I saved your life. Waste of time.zts3166e	You. Devil.zts3167e	Demon: Hahaha! Enjoy chaos and horror. and despair. That sealing stone will take you to Sladeheim!zts3168e	Silence, horror.. and deepest despair.zts3169e	No. Never. I will do it. I will terminate Sladeheim. I will call on the team and collect the power of all the adventurers in Milano! I, I will save the world!zts3170e	Herbteazts3171e	Mysterious Wizard: Hmm.. I will keep watching you!!zts3172e	The Mysterious wizard disappeared suddenly.zts3173e	Ah.. Patrisha.. Are you okay?zts3174e	Ah.. Is it you?zts3175e	What was that all about?zts3176e	It's something about my privacy. None of your business.zts3177e	Okay. Well. I understand.zts3178e	You all!! Chase Herbtea!! Search the place!!zts3179e	Partisha and the Blackshoes family have retreated.zts3180e	His name is. Herbtea?zts3181e	Ah. You are Herbtea!zts3182e	Well done, but you, human!! Don't butt into our matters!!zts3183e	Herbtea promptly disappears.zts3184e	Give up, Princess of Darksy.zts3185e	Shoot.. I am blown up!!zts3186e	Patrisha. What happened to you?zts3187e	Heh. That spoiled kid evaded all the pursuing Blackshoes families. Haha.zts3188e	Hey!! It's not funny!!zts3189e	Hey Princess. Nobody can help you out. Stop resisting and just come with me.zts3190e	No. I won't do that!!zts3191e	Give up Human. Okay, Herbtea. Let's go!!zts3192e	You are clever. Okay, you. Human. Get out of here. I don't want to kill you.zts3193e	No!!zts3194e	Stop it!! It's not your business!!zts3195e	Catsy doesn't like others species to butt into the Catsy's problem. You understand?zts3196e	(Patrisha is pulled along by Herbtea)zts3197e	Knight 1: Princess, Princess!! Where are you!!zts3198e	Knight 2: Oh my God!! The Princess disappeared!!zts3199e	Hey.. You!!zts3200e	Knight 3: Ah. You. Did you see Princess?zts3201e	Patrisha. She followed Herbtea.zts3202e	Knight 1: Oh No!!zts3203e	Knight 2: Gosh!!zts3204e	Knight 3: It's our fault!!zts3205e	Sorry. I tried to protect her. But.zts3206e	Knight 2: No.. He's a powerful wizard. And if he is of Devil's power, you can't beat him.zts3207e	Knight 3: Anyway, let's chase them. Let's hurry!zts3208e	But.. what can we do?zts3209e	Knight 1: You can use this.zts3210e	This. this is?zts3211e	Knight 1: This is an emblem of the Blackshoes Knights. With this, we can chase any of the knights.zts3212e	Knight 2: This is not the time to talk and talk. Let's leave!!zts3213e	(A boring and tedious chase to Patrisha. The Blackshoes Knights also are getting very tired.)zts3214e	Are you sure this is the place?zts3215e	Knight 1: Yes.. I am. The Princess is somewhere nearby!!zts3216e	By the way, who is Herbtea? Why did he take her away?zts3217e	Knight 2: He was known as the Wizard Genius. Was very famous in Catsy. But one day, he came to Patrisha and said he would join Darksy.zts3218e	Knight 2: I don't know exactly why, but I guess he wanted to be a more famous figure. He probably thought that he could make it in Darksy and not in Catsy.. Because Darksy is rather generous to wizards.zts3219e	Yes.. I understand..zts3220e	Knight 2: But. Patrisha didn't trust him much and Herbtea came to know about it. So, he stole the secret document of the BlackShoes Knights and ran into Catsy.zts3221e	Knight 2: Unfortunately, Catsy doesn't trust this betrayer either, So he was deserted by Catsy too and now he has become an enemy to both sides.zts3222e	Knight 2: Even though I don't know the intention of Herbtea exactly.zts3223e	At least, Herbtea hates Patrisha.zts3224e	Knight 2: Right.zts3225e	Just a moment.. Did you hear something??zts3226e	Knight 3: Watch out!! Something's coming!zts3227e	Knight 1: The Rosebud Knights!!zts3228e	Knight 2: The Rosebud Knights have come!!zts3229e	Knight 3: Attack!!zts3230e	Hey. This isn't our original plan!zts3231e	Stop attacking!!zts3232e	Knight 1: He is Cenil!!zts3233e	Knight 2: Let's attack him!!zts3234e	Stop it!! We have to find Patrisha. Did you forget that?zts3235e	Hey, Darksy!! If you hold back your swords, we are willing to stop this meaningless fight!zts3236e	Small bustles. And then silence. The battle is over.zts3237e	(Sigh!) Hey. You. Human. What brought you here?zts3238e	We are searching for Patrisha.zts3239e	Patrisha? Haha. Got it.zts3240e	Do you know anything about it?zts3241e	Well.. that's enough. Now, we are going back. Bye Darksy!!zts3242e	The Rosebud Knights have retreated.zts3243e	Knight 1: What do they have in mind?zts3244e	Knight 2: Can we let them go?zts3245e	That's okay.. Let's continue searching again!!zts3246e	Hmm.. It's endless.zts3247e	Knight 1: Hey.. Look at this! The Emblem of Blackshoes is falling to pieces!!zts3248e	What do you mean?zts3249e	Knight 2: It means that the Princess is not here anymore or something terrible has happened to her.zts3250e	Gosh.. and then let's get out of here.zts3251e	Don't you think. we fell into a trap?zts3252e	Knight 1: Probably.zts3253e	Knight 2: And then, can we escape here?zts3254e	Now.. I am too tired to fight.zts3255e	You have given up already? Uhh.zts3256e	Hurry up.. All of you follow me!zts3257e	Now, you're safe!zts3258e	Why. Why did you saved us?zts3259e	Let me tell you the conclusion first. Your Princess was not there. Someone knew you were chasing and setup a trap there.zts3260e	Knight 1: Why do we have to trust you?zts3261e	Knight 2: What is your purpose??zts3262e	Whether you trust me or not, doesn't matter. Just take it.zts3263e	Knight 3: This is an emblem of the Rosebud Knights!!zts3264e	Keep it and you can follow me. You just might meet your Princess.zts3265e	Knight 1: ..zts3266e	Knight 2: ..zts3267e	Knight 3: ..zts3268e	Your faces say you don't trust me.. But anyway, it's up to you and I am leaving. Bye.zts3269e	Cenil goes away.zts3270e	(The dark and humid air gives an ominous impression.)zts3271e	Knight 1: Cenil.. Did he deceive us?zts3272e	No, at least he is not that mean.zts3273e	Knight 2: I hope not.zts3274e	Knight 3: Quite!! Something's approaching!!zts3275e	(Sigh!!)zts3276e	Knight 1: Yes.. I smell a rat!!zts3277e	Not yet.. Let's go there and find it!zts3278e	Hmm. I guess one of them is real.zts3279e	Knight 1: Be cautious!!zts3280e	Knight 1: This is. Cenil probably cheated us!zts3281e	Knight 2: We better get out of here.zts3282e	But what about Patrisha.. We have to save her!!zts3283e	Knight 3: ..zts3284e	We don't have any other choice but to go through it!zts3285e	Knight 1: Yes.. You're right.zts3286e	Knight 2: Okay.. And then, let's get through it!zts3287e	Knight 3: Yes!! Let's go then!!zts3288e	Haha.. You are late. I have been waiting for you!!zts3289e	Knight 1: Why you are here with Herbtea??zts3290e	It's because.zts3291e	Cenil. What is happening here?zts3292e	To get Patrisha from Herbtea.zts3293e	Knight 1: Yes.. you deceived us!!zts3294e	Knight 2: We should not have trusted you!!zts3295e	Knight 3: Cenil!! You are doomed!!zts3296e	No!! Let me complete it.zts3297e	Knight 1: Anything more you have to say?zts3298e	Your Princess is safe now.zts3299e	What??zts3300e	Herbtea wanted to give Patrisha to me and in return he will join the Rosebud Knights. However.zts3301e	I don't compromise with a mean opportunist.zts3302e	Patrisha is already free and Herbtea was already arrested by my knights. I will give him over to you. Whether punishing him or setting him free is your decision.zts3303e	Hahaha.zts3304e	Now, Blackshoes Knights!! Here, I am handing over Herbtea to you!!zts3305e	Don't call my name!!zts3306e	Aura surrounds Herbtea!!zts3307e	Cenil! Watch out!zts3308e	Ukk. I was careless.zts3309e	I won't forgive you. You betrayed me and threw my name into a ditch.zts3310e	The Devils come together to Herbtea!!zts3311e	Where is Herbtea?zts3312e	Already gone.zts3313e	Knight 1: Shoot!!zts3314e	Knight 2: We almost caught him!!zts3315e	I underestimated Herbtea, but don't worry. In the name of the Rosebud Knights, I will punish him!!zts3316e	Patrisha shows up.zts3317e	Here you are.zts3318e	Knight 1: Princess!!zts3319e	Knight 2: Princess!!zts3320e	Knight 3: Princess!!zts3321e	I am okay, so don't worry about me and Cenil!!zts3322e	Thanks.zts3323e	I didn't intend to help you, so.. no need to thank me!!zts3324e	Anyway, it's so bad to lose Herbtea.. Well, it's not bad though.zts3325e	Knight 1: Give me an order!!zts3326e	We will chase him and he will pay!zts3327e	Where are we??zts3328e	Here. it's.zts3329e	Something's strange.zts3330e	It.. It's the end.zts3331e	Really?zts3332e	(Suddenly Herbtea shows up. His body shining with lights.)zts3333e	Holiwind!!zts3334e	(The Devils disappeared suddenly.)zts3335e	What are you looking at?zts3336e	Ah. Anyway. Thanks a lot!zts3337e	Hey.. Human. Follow me. I know where the exit is.zts3338e	Really. It's so great!zts3339e	Don't talk much. Hurry up.zts3340e	Why you are here??zts3341e	That's what I want to ask you.. Why are the Rosebud Knights here?zts3342e	This is a trap Herbtea set to catch us.zts3343e	Anyway, we will catch Herbtea here.. We are lucky!zts3344e	(Faint voice) Hey. You. Human.zts3345e	(Faint voice) Hey, you.. human, I didn't mean to bring out this fuss.zts3346e	Umm. Yes.zts3347e	(Faint voice) Anyway, I saved your life before, so pay back now!zts3348e	Herbtea suddenly aims the sword at the throat of the Adventurer.zts3349e	Hey, Cenil!!zts3350e	What are you doing!zts3351e	Well.. We don't have to fight. We are not an enemy to each other.zts3352e	He is innocent, just release him.zts3353e	Set me free and then our fight will be over!!zts3354e	Now!!zts3355e	Rosebud Knights!! Release him.zts3356e	(Faint voice) Heh. Human. Thanks a lot!zts3357e	Where are we now?zts3358e	This strange feeling.. It's familiar!!zts3359e	Something's there!!zts3360e	It's you again!! I don't know why I am involved in your affairs!zts3361e	You, human. follow me.zts3362e	Patrisha!!zts3363e	Why on earth are you here?zts3364e	Hmm. Is this Herbtea's trap, too?zts3365e	He can't deny it.zts3366e	Yes. Probably.zts3367e	Hey, Herbtea. You are also dead meat.zts3368e	(Faint voice) Mr. Human. It's due to you. Without you, this trap couldn't be spoiled like this. It's twice. Thanks a lot for screwing up my plans.zts3369e	Give up if you want to catch me.zts3370e	(The Adventurer throws himself to Patrisha)zts3371e	Haha.zts3372e	Now, it's over. Herbtea!zts3373e	Blackshoes Knights!! Arrest him now!zts3374e	Patrisha, stop it!zts3375e	Herbtea saved my life twice!zts3376e	So what? This is a matter with our Catsy. You better step back.zts3377e	Herbtea may not be the villain you think!zts3378e	It will be judged in our court later!zts3379e	If you want to arrest him.zts3380e	??zts3381e	You have to fell me down first!zts3382e	(Sigh!!) .. Don't say that. This is a very important matter to our Catsy.zts3383e	I am not saying I will release him unconditionally.zts3384e	From now on, I will keep my eyes on him!zts3385e	What do you mean?zts3386e	It means from now on, you are my companion.zts3387e	Even Herbtea can't do much with me. Also, Herbtea, as long as you stay with me, you will be protected from Patrisha and Cenil.zts3388e	Hmm. not a bad idea.zts3389e	Patrisha!!zts3390e	Okay. Let's retreat!zts3391e	Thanks Patrisha!!zts3392e	That's alright!! And you Herbtea!!zts3393e	You'd better stop making any more trouble.zts3394e	(The Blackshoes Knights turn back and disappear.)zts3395e	Why did you save me?zts3396e	I don't know.zts3397e	Well.. It's fun.. Anyway, it's okay, I didn't lose anything.zts3398e	Yes, let's keep close to each other.zts3399e	No need for that. And don't trust me much. HeeHeeHee!!zts3400e	(Hmm.. Should I have given him over to them?)zts3401e	Clue of Ruinszts3402e	[Boy's note]zts3403e	To mom, dad and all friends in Milano.zts3404e	This is Romeo. How are you? I am fine here.zts3405e	As you know, it's a very cold and silent place. And all of the wizards are too smart for themselves. They hardly say anything.zts3406e	Everyday is monotonous, but nowhere close to hard work. So I really can't complain much.zts3407e	I am lucky to be doing errands for a Great wizard called Radal.zts3408e	He can be quite picky at times, but he is a nice man on the whole. Other boys are having a difficult time with the other wizards here.zts3409e	For example, I once broke his marble ball by mistake, but he was not upset nor angry with me. Rather, he let me go.. So I did.. (The next sentences were burnt and cannot be read.)zts3410e	If I get lucky, I might even get to do my apprenticeship with him. But I have to go down to the underground laboratory for that.zts3411e	The sounds that come from there every night are.. Gosh. Scary. I can't express it with words. It sounds like a Demon's scream. (The next pages were burnt.)zts3412e	[Preface of Experiment Report]zts3413e	With respect for the great history of the Lopello family, I hereby report as follows.zts3414e	Summary of Report.zts3415e	In the past, it used to be an experimental laboratory of Duke, the legendary wizard. This lab was made to analyze the magic power in the chasm of TimeSpace. Now, the Great wizard Radal and his magician team are working to restore the data.zts3416e	-The Chasms of TimeSpace were created by someone on purpose. He twisted time and space by force.zts3417e	- Through these chasms, we can access to a totally different world.zts3418e	- According to Duke, the legendary wizard, apart from East mile, there are three spaces more, and these spaces are disconnected into pieces.zts3419e	- Chasms of TimeSpace come from these twisted locations.zts3420e	- The power of magic coming from these chasms is beyond our imagination. And like all powerful things, if it is abused for vicious purpose, it may destroy the whole world.zts3421e	- We can't find what power lies among all 4 spaces.zts3422e	- Also, we have no idea who twisted these spaces.zts3423e	- Ultimate goal of Duke was to bring this power to the world.zts3424e	- Now, to find more information, we are constructing the pathway to move into ground ruins. This ruins have been shut down for long time, but we will collect more data soon.zts3425e	[Medical Chart]zts3426e	Name: Romeo Whitezts3427e	Title: Apprenticeship of magicianzts3428e	Symptom: Became insane and impulsive. Having wolf tooth, personality disappeared. Having resistance to magic power.zts3429e	Accident: That patient was working on the wastes in lab #7. Other than this patient, 2 more apprentices were working together with him.zts3430e	1 hour after starting work, he suddenly had a seizure and bit the co-workers on the neck. One co-worker died immediately.zts3431e	Another colleague fought him, but bled too much. Slim chance for survival.zts3432e	Comment: According to wizards who witnessed the accident, the patient has more power than ordinary human beings against magic power.zts3433e	Considering we already have 4 similar cases, though I can't find the reason, I guess he was Demonized by some mysterious evil power.zts3434e	At this moment, he lost all of his original personality and memory. Recovery impossible. Euthanasia recommended.zts3435e	[Letter to Great Wizard Radal]zts3436e	Dear Great Wizard Radalzts3437e	I guess you know about what is happening in the underground laboratory.zts3438e	So far, at least 15 apprentices were Demonized and all of them became subjects of mercy-killing. Including all the people who were wounded, the number reaches 50. Also, 2 wizards with similar symptoms have been separated, even though they didn't go down to the underground.zts3439e	If we ignore this, things will be beyond our control soon. I am so afraid and I think it's time we tread wisely from now on.zts3440e	For the last 3 years, we've collected most of the research work of Duke. However, for the last 1 year, we couldn't find any meaningful data. So I think we better stop working here.zts3441e	Most of the people here are talking about the recent accidents. They say that if they don't stop now, it will cause a huge disaster.zts3442e	Now, we need a wise decision from you, the greatest wizard. Please, with your deep and discrete counsel, protect all of us.zts3443e	--] Lab # 5, From the chief wizard, Lamias Brookhieldzts3444e	[Diary of an apprenticeship. It is stained with drops of blood]zts3445e	7th, Nov. //zts3446e	Oh. My.zts3447e	Everyone's insane here.. I need to escape. But how?zts3448e	Everyone keeps silent, but I know Romeo became insane and dead. Even wizard Ramias doesn't look normal. Who knows? Everyone except me are already crazy.zts3449e	I don't know. But I feel this lab is separated from the outside. Will they let us leave here alive? No way! I will find a way to escape tomorrow. When I get out. (Diary is finished here)zts3450e	[Memo. It was written in haste]zts3451e	Mother Erenia, Save us.zts3452e	Mother Erenia, Save us from those Demons.zts3453e	[Research paper of one wizard]zts3454e	Everyone knows Erenia, Goddess. She is unique and dominates this world in honor.zts3455e	But few knows Zenas, the God of Spirit. This name exists only in legend and nobody worships him in this world.zts3456e	According to the legend, Zenas was the enemy of Erenia and was doomed to death. But here, with the work of Duke, the legendary wizard, the shadow of Zenas is still alive. Can you believe it?zts3457e	This Shadow destroyed Duke, the legendary wizard. According to his research, he didn't know it was Zenas, but couldn't resist its invincible power and had been afraid of it.zts3458e	Now, after analyzing the research of Duke, we can define that it was Zenas.zts3459e	In spite of that condition, Duke continued to research on the chasm of TimeSpace. And the response was harsh. We, including wizard Radal, are showing the results of his efforts.. It ruins everything.zts3460e	Even though we don't know the details, we know that one day, Duke and his labs were destroyed by mysterious and evil powers. And that power.. Zenas.. may be watching us even at this very moment.zts3461e	The curse of Zenas stays in this lab.. If not, where is this curse and the smell of corpses coming from??zts3462e	[Counseling Chart]zts3463e	Question: Why do you want to quit working for the lab?zts3464e	Answer: I saw a Demon!!zts3465e	Q: There's no Demon. Everyone has a disease here and because of this, you saw a mirage. We are working on a solution to treat it. You don't have to quit working because of this.zts3466e	A: I saw a Demon. I am sure of it!!zts3467e	Q: I told you there's no Demon or anything.zts3468e	A: It was a Demon. A Demon!! It will kill all of us. It will drive us to insanity!!zts3469e	Q: Calm down. There's no Demon!!zts3470e	A: You will be killed too. That.. That will make us insane and devour us in the long run!!zts3471e	Q: I can't let you out due to non-existing devils. I will let you take rest for 7 days and then will make the conclusion after 7 days.zts3472e	A: No.. Let me out of here. It's coming.. that Demon is approaching!!zts3473e	[Mysterious Note]zts3474e	A key was discovered. As Wizard Radal said, the key is the source of all powers. But in the adventure team, only 3 members, including me survived. The rest of them went insane and started chasing us.zts3475e	[Wills of Radal]zts3476e	You said. it's the shadow of Zenas. I laughed at you. But it was true. You were right. Even though I am not sure if my apology can reach you, I want to tell you how terribly I feel for ignoring your words.zts3477e	In this lab, except me, everyone has lost their mind and become a 'guardian'.zts3478e	Ah. You probably don't know what a 'guardian' is. It's the result of the disease. The power didn't make us insane but came into our minds and brainwashed us to protect this place.zts3479e	These guardians will attack all the lives that approach this place. They are very violent and fierce.zts3480e	Who did it? It's a Demon. It spreads this disease. You said it's the shadow of Zenas, but I don't think Zenas exists.zts3481e	Anyway, it's all over. All of our research will be dust because the guardians won't leave it. I regret it now, but I guess it's too late.zts3482e	You may be wondering how I can write down this letter, when everyone else has become a guardian. But to be honest with you, I am also a guardian.zts3483e	With my willingness, I barely managed to press down the effect of this disease, but don't know how long I can hold it.zts3484e	I remember you said you would come back after 2 months. If so, please do me a favor. When you see me, kill me. That is the only hope in my heart. Please help me not live in this curse anymore.zts3485e	I don't want to lose my mind and be a puppet of someone else. Ahhh. I really hope this letter reaches you!zts3486e	Congratulations. Now, our rookie's adventure gets qualified to challenge Lv.18 Hero mission!zts3487e	Here, the Adventure Association has prepared a gift for Secret Partners.zts3488e	Clear Lv.18 Hero mission and get the Secret Partner Stone of TimeSpace!zts3489e	This stone is for secret partners.

Gosh.zts3518e	Anything fun?zts3519e	It's like a seal. A seal to go to Shadow Zenas.zts3520e	Shadow Zenas? What is that?zts3522e	Really.zts3524e	What is this?zts3526e	Are you sure?zts3528e	Anyway, thanks.zts3529e	For later use.zts3530e	Additional Dialoguezts3531e	Tutorial mission for TimeSpacezts3532e	The lobby is the place where you get ready to start a mission.zts3533e	The mission has not started yet.zts3534e	If you want to meet buddies to help you in this mission, you can meet up here and continue.zts3535e	When you are ready, move to the portal on the other side.zts3536e	Can you see the aggression in these monsters? Unlike monsters on the field, they are more violent and will attack you on sight.zts3537e	Go ahead and fight them. If you want to avoid them, just move onto the next open portal.zts3538e	Sometimes, when you enter a room, all the portals in the room will be locked.zts3539e	In such cases, you will have to terminate all enemies to open a portal.zts3540e	Good Job! The portal is now open. Hurry and get out of here!zts3541e	If you see a lever, check it. Sometimes you can unlock a portal with this.zts3542e	Oops!! I forgot to tell you. Sometimes a lever may be a trap!zts3543e	If you touch a lever with a trap, you will be attacked by monsters.zts3544e	This room has a time limit. If you can't terminate all the enemies within the limit, your mission fails.zts3545e	If you fail in this tutorial mode, shame.. shame.. BIG shame on you!!zts3546e	While traveling in the Stone of TimeSpace, it is most important to keep time. The chasm through which you enter the stone is very unstable, so you can't stay there for long.zts3547e	After a certain time, you will be pushed out of it. So here, in Nostale, the adventurer must finish his mission as quickly as possible.zts3548e	Look at the bottom of the screen. Can you see the clocks? You have to clear the mission before all the clocks disappear.zts3549e	Ah. While I was explaining, other enemies have appeared.zts3550e	That's all I can teach you.zts3551e	But keep in mind that you will face much more dangerous and various experiences much beyond your imagination.zts3552e	But don't be afraid. That is what an adventure is meant to be.zts3553e	Now, let's get out of here. I wish you all the best!!zts3554e	Uhhh!! Dangerous!!zts3555e	Oh my.. One of the Milano guards is under attack! As you can see, if one companion with shining light dies, the mission fails.zts3556e	Questzts3557e	No, No. All of you have special powers. Only so far, you didn't have the chance to verify them!zts3558e	From now on, NosCamp will help you show your powers!!zts3559e	Let's start with fighting against enemies. What about the easiest enemy first? Okay? Let's go!!zts3560e	Congratulations!! You now have a chicken as your pet. Do not underestimate your pet!zts3562e	..zts3563e	Hi, How are you?zts3564e	HELLO!! HOW ARE YOU? (Shouting)zts3565e	AHHH!! You surprised me!!zts3566e	Eril told me about you. I came by here to get some stuff for my adventure.zts3567e	Ah. I see. Our association of alchemy is. (Pause) that is. (Long pause) . (Silence)zts3568e	So where were we? Yeah.. we serve the rookie adventurers of NosCamp with useful magic supplies.zts3569e	(Mumbling) The works seem to be endless. (Like his mumbling. never-ending)zts3570e	Wha. What is this? Now he is all ears.zts3571e	Pay attention!! All existence has some mysterious power in it. Alchemy is to take that power and harness it for our needs.zts3572e	With alchemy, we can produce a lot of useful goods. like magic supplies for adventurers who come here. Isn't that cool?zts3573e	(Mumbling) (Grumbling)zts3574e	Everything. everything came back.zts3575e	Yes. Thanks.zts3576e	(Mumbling) . (Mumbling) .zts3577e	What about the others?zts3578e	No need to ask more.zts3579e	Ex. Excuse me.zts3580e	(Sigh) What now?zts3581e	Where can I get some.. food?zts3582e	Go to the mart.zts3583e	Ah.. Yes!! (Like it helps..)zts3584e	Ok, let's start an adventure!!zts3585e	(Glance)zts3586e	<pname>: Me! Me!! Look at me!zts3587e	Hohoho.. No! It's too dangerous for you <pname>.zts3588e	It may be hard.zts3589e	Hahaha!! Told you I could handle it.zts3590e	Ahaha.. Yes.. Yes.. that's right!zts3591e	Will you go to the Northern prairie and take care of the sheep?zts3592e	(<pname> explains what happened in TimeSpace to Eril.)zts3593e	How can a small village like Milano survive?zts3594e	Using production items, you can produce many goods by yourself.zts3595e	Yes, tell me.zts3596e	Sure, give it to me. (Mr. Sellbig of all people!!)zts3597e	Why?zts3598e	Why? Why?zts3599e	(Grumbling)zts3600e	Excuse me. but you called for me?zts3601e	What favor?zts3602e	Uhh. Thanks. (Mumbling)zts3603e	Yes.. To get the material easily.. you'll have to capture the Devils.. (Mumbling)zts3604e	Hmm. Okay. But where? And what devils do I have to capture?zts3605e	Grr.. The more I ask, the more pissed off I get.zts3606e	Wow! Thanks a lot.zts3607e	Haha.. You're welcome.zts3608e	Oh. By the way.zts3609e	What!! I brought it back here with great difficulty! In fact, I barely managed getting back in one piece!zts3610e	Huh?! Did someone just call me?zts3611e	Hey.. Over here.. It's me Vellochika, from Milano Mart.zts3612e	No! I meant.zts3613e	Wow! Thanks. You're the best!zts3614e	Well. I mean.zts3615e	Passer by Shouting: It seems like there is a problem in the village.zts3616e	Hey, where are you going?! We're not done here! Come back!!zts3617e	Welcome. I heard you helped the guards. They were all praises for you. That was a great job you did out there.zts3618e	Check your equipment and skill and come back to me.zts3619e	(Eril is too busy to listen.)zts3620e	Yes. Did you call me?zts3621e	Miner 2: Soon.zts3622e	Some serious talk.zts3623e	Yes?zts3624e	Yeah!zts3625e	Where do I have to go?zts3626e	Where must I go?zts3627e	Hey!!

I also don't.zts3632e	Miner 2: Now let's start!zts3633e	Miner 1: Now let's start!zts3634e	Miner 3: Now let's start!zts3635e	So, is there nothing we can do?zts3636e	Me?zts3637e	..zts3638e	Why?zts3639e	Bad news. Sir Lopello has rejected compromising with the Kovolts.zts3640e	Why. Why?zts3641e	He said it's not worth taking to them.. to the Kovolts.zts3642e	What?zts3643e	Yes.. And we can't do anything because the Adventurer Association was created by Sir Lopello. I am so sad about that.zts3644e	I feel like I am nothing.zts3645e	I know it's not right, but we have to follow this.zts3646e	Gosh!! Who surprised me?zts3647e	Hmm. Really?zts3648e	Hey!zts3649e	Yes?zts3650e	Bring me something I requested and then, I will give you a surprising gift.zts3651e	What are you talking about?zts3652e	Now, here you go!zts3653e	Ok. Here. Here I go!zts3654e	Driven by that groundless power of Sam, accepted his request.zts3655e	Ok, next one!zts3656e	This. this is.zts3657e	You know what? In the Western mines, people hear some breaking noise very often.zts3658e	Heh.. It's because nobody wants to listen to the sadness of the world.zts3659e	This world has lost the breath of the soul and has become meaningless.zts3660e	??zts3661e	Hey.zts3662e	Uh. Uh.zts3663e	Don't know what sound it is?zts3664e	Uhh. Yes!zts3665e	Inspect the Western mines. Something's there for sure.zts3666e	Uhh.

You'd better get warmed up first. Why don't you go hunting for a while.zts3720e	Show me some improvement and I will teach you the attacking skills immediately.zts3721e	You are better than the other new cadets. But don't be hasty. Concentrate on your training.zts3722e	Not bad. not bad at all. As promised, I will train you in attack skills.zts3723e	For a level 20 adventurer, the base attacking skills are offered for free.zts3724e	Give the training your best shot.zts3725e	You are looking great after skill training. We can finally start an adventure.zts3726e	Before you start, let's find some equipment for you. You can purchase them in the shops around the village.zts3727e	Let's begin with the Alchemy Association in the village. The first person to meet is Raul from the association. Let's start!zts3728e	Are you sure you're ready? You don't seem to be. Haha.zts3729e	Hey, how are you?zts3730e	Ah. yes. (Mumbling) .zts3731e	.. (Mumble) .. I shall explain what alchemy is..zts3732e	(Suddenly, Raul looks very interested.)zts3733e	Yeah, thanks a lot.zts3734e	Excuse me, do you know where I can buy equipment?zts3735e	Over there. If you turn around, you can see Mr. Smith's equipment shop. (Mumbling) .zts3736e	Just a minute.zts3737e	There happens to be two Smiths in our village. They are twins. You have to ask for the Mr. Smith with a hammer in his hand.zts3738e	What about the other Mr. Smith?zts3739e	Hmm.. is it you?zts3740e	The rookie adventurer from NosCamp.zts3741e	Ah yes, that's me.zts3742e	Here. Take this item. Eril asked me to give this to you.zts3743e	Are you giving it to me for free?zts3744e	Yeah!! Just take it before I change my mind.zts3745e	(He doesn't look very friendly and hardly talks at all)zts3746e	Welcome to the Milano Mart. Excellent taste and quality guaranteed!zts3747e	We have a special event today. For all new adventurers coming to Milano, food is on the house!zts3748e	Help yourself to our delicious food!zts3749e	Woah, you sure do know your business.zts3750e	Hehe.. more than just that. I am Vellochika, the head chef.zts3751e	How did shopping go?zts3752e	Great!! Look at them, I got it all for free! Hehe.zts3753e	Haha.. every rookie adventurer gets the best experience at NosCamp!zts3754e	Yes!zts3755e	In Eastmile, mysterious portals have appeared. These dark portals are referred to as the Chasms of TimeSpace. The Devils have entered the Milano fields through the Chasm and are threatening the peace.zts3756e	This mission is of utmost importance and is entrusted upon you, young adventurer. Your mission is to protect our village from the creatures that emerge from the chasm.zts3757e	It is said that to capture the tiger, you must first approach it. You must be wondering how to reach this chasm, right?zts3758e	Have you ever heard about the Stone of TimeSpace? This stone is known to connect the chasm with our world. But no one really knows how the Stone came into this world in the first place.zts3759e	The entrance to these chasms are also controlled by the stones. So, as an adventurer, finding the Stone will be your initial challenge.zts3760e	Enough talking now. I will show you how to go and explore within the Stone of TimeSpace.zts3761e	First, enter the TimeSpace area through the Stone of TimeSpace in the Northern area of the village.zts3762e	How was your first experience in TimeSpace? Well, did you enjoy it? I can tell from the look in your eyes that you like the thrill of adventure.zts3763e	Congratulations! Here, take this equipment with a rare level.zts3764e	With a rare level? What's a rare level?zts3765e	Yes. Look at the clothes you just received. It says [Clothes of an Excellent Adventurer]. Rare level equipment have descriptions like this.zts3766e	Right-click on the item and check the information window. Can you see what the rare level is?zts3767e	Excuse me, I have come to NosCamp looking for some help.zts3768e	Welcome Milano guard. What brings you here?zts3769e	Well it is my duty to patrol the Northern area of the Prairie today, but my mother has an upset stomach. so.zts3770e	So, is there any adventurer who would wish to patrol there instead of me?zts3771e	Well, let's see.. Who could fill in for you and do the duty of the guards?zts3772e	No! Trust me! I can do it!zts3773e	Really? Will you do it?zts3774e	Haha.. don't worry. It's only the northern area right?zts3775e	Uh? Haven't you left yet?zts3776e	Ah, you're safe!zts3777e	On the way, I met a Guard and helped him out too!zts3778e	Wow, you are great! You even helped out our guards. Please accept this. this is my gift to you.zts3779e	Hey cool. thanks a lot Sam!zts3780e	Hmm.. this time we have an excellent guy, don't we?zts3781e	Yes. He patrolled once as a replacement for me.zts3782e	Oh, he's not like any other adventurer. Do you remember the other day, an immature adventurer didn't listen to our advice and made a big fuss. So, it's hard to handle it.zts3783e	Of course, some adventurers are as good as you are.zts3784e	Hmm. Then, could you do me a favor? Nowadays, wild sheep show up and spoil our farms.zts3785e	I will pay you a lot if you can handle this sheep problem.zts3786e	Mild or Wild, Handling sheep can't be much of a problem. I'll do it.zts3787e	That is so good. We have a deal then, Young adventurer.zts3788e	All the best!zts3789e	I am beginning to like you!! This is the upgraded wooden sword that I used to use. It will be of better use in your hands now.zts3790e	Congratulations! You've already reached level 8. Has your chicken grown too?zts3791e	Anyway, it's time to get your second pet. This time your target is a friendly white sheep.zts3792e	It has a strong heart and is very loyal to its master. So, if you keep it as a pet, it will aid you well in a lot of your missions.zts3793e	Now let's go make an adventure team for you!zts3795e	Ah, but we have a problem. you can't bring two pets at the same time. Did you notice that your new pet has disappeared?zts3796e	If you're wondering where is it, the answer is in Mini-land!zts3797e	Yes. Let's have a look at the Mini-land and once we get there we will change your pet to a friendly white sheep.zts3798e	I sense an ominous turn of events somewhere. What is happening?zts3799e	As time goes by, the world seems to become increasingly dangerous.zts3800e	There are rumors that evil minions of the Devil are coming through the Chasm of TimeSpace. Some say that they have seen such old creatures only in ancient legends.zts3801e	But we have the NosCamp in Milano.zts3802e	Yes, definitely. We have hope because of brave adventurers like you.zts3803e	In that regard, here's an event to motivate the NosCamp adventurers. It is a special gift!zts3804e	Ah, is this a tool for production?zts3805e	Try producing something by yourself.zts3806e	Hehe. It's a great accessory, but.zts3807e	Unfortunately, it isn't that useful.zts3808e	The real power of the accessory is unleashed by the options added to it.zts3809e	Ms. Celloin at the accessory shop is an expert in this field. Drop in to her place to know more.zts3810e	Hi. Pleasant weather, isn't it?zts3811e	Not as pleasant as you!! Eril sent me here.zts3812e	Ah. (Blush) . Are you here to learn about options? I sell accessories, refine them with Cellon and add options to them.zts3813e	Well, we give one Cellon as a gift for first time visitors. So what do you think? Do you need to refine something now? Or would you like to do it later.zts3814e	Ah, Mr. Adventurer. Would you do me a favor?zts3815e	I'm a little busy right now. Could you pass this lunch box to Mr. Sellbig?zts3816e	He's so busy that he skips his lunch! If no one takes care of him, his health will get bad.zts3817e	He's so busy that he skips his lunch! If no one takes care of him, his health will get bad.zts3818e	Well, no specific reason.zts3819e	You don't have to know this.zts3820e	Hmm. You won't eat this. Will you?zts3821e	Hmm. But this. It's on sale in the mart.zts3822e	Hmm. No. It sounds ridiculous!zts3823e	Ah, it's lunch time already. Thanks.zts3824e	Well, it's not mine. Hahaha.zts3825e	Haha.. I know. This is a gift from Celloin, right?zts3826e	(Surprised) Well, it is.zts3827e	Hehe.. Don't be surprised. I have known Celloin's generosity for a long time.zts3828e	.. Yeah? I wasn't supposed to tell you.zts3829e	You seem embarrassed.. Sorry about that. To make up for this, I will give you some useful advice.zts3830e	Well, you guessed right. I am kinda embarrassed. But you don't have to apologize. or give me advice!zts3831e	Haha. That's okay. Anyway, I'm supposed to tell you about it. It's also one of the adventurer services of NosCamp.zts3832e	Today's training is about Plus skills. Do you remember the Base skills you learned before? Plus skills are additional optional skills for these base skills.zts3833e	Ah, There you are! Mr. Raul was asking for something. Will you go see him?zts3834e	Hmm. Here you are. As a matter of fact. I have a. a. favor to ask of you.zts3835e	I have to produce 100 potions by today, but some of the material is not.zts3836e	So you want me to get the material, right?zts3837e	Hey! To get the material, I should at least know where and what am I supposed to look for anyway.zts3838e	Northern area? To the. North. There. (Mumbling)zts3839e	I don't.. need.. all of them now.zts3840e	Sorry. But.. the order was cancelled. because it was overdue. So, take all the remaining material back. If you want, I could make some re-vitalizer for you.zts3841e	Hey! <pname>!zts3842e	Ah, gimme a minute. I'll be there in a jiffy!zts3843e	I was worried that you might have left already.zts3844e	What happened? Why did you call me?zts3845e	Well, I heard the story!zts3846e	What story?zts3847e	Story of the material.. the material you took to Raul.zts3848e	Well, so what?zts3849e	I need a lot of material too right now, but I am kinda busy.zts3850e	Haha. Thought so. But isn't it easy to come by food items inside the village itself?zts3851e	Are you discriminating my profession? (Frowns)zts3852e	If you weren't, good. So, this is what I need.zts3853e	Hey, slow down girl. Now tell me again. slowly.zts3854e	Hehe.. Thanks.zts3855e	(Whisper) Here we go again!zts3856e	Well, I gotta go now. (Sigh)zts3857e	No! Not now. There's still a lot of materials that I need.zts3858e	This time.zts3859e	What. What is that?zts3860e	Guard: All guards, fellow adventurers and good people of the village. Be on your guard! A large number of Devils are emerging from the Northern area of the Prairie. They will begin attacking us soon!zts3861e	Guard: Good job! We thwarted them!zts3862e	Guard: But it is still dangerous. I wish I could stay here longer.zts3863e	Yes, I understand.zts3864e	Guard: When things get back to normal, you can go back to NosCamp. We could really use the help of skilled adventurers like you. Thanks again!!zts3865e	Refresh yourself. It's time for another adventure!zts3866e	Are you ready? Now, for the final part of our preparations, we shall make the most essential thing you need to go on this adventure.zts3867e	The most essential thing?zts3868e	Tada! It's the Kovolt mask!zts3869e	The Kovolt mask? Why would I need that?zts3870e	Well, think of it as part of the perfect preparation. You will learn of the reason later.zts3871e	Anyway, collect these things for me and I will make you a Kovolt mask. I will need Dander Seed (6) from Weak toxidane and Seedle leaves (4) from Light seedle.zts3872e	You collected all of them? Good job. Hold on a moment, I will make a Kovolt mask for you.zts3873e	Eril.. Eril! We have a problem!zts3874e	Problem? What is it?zts3875e	The adventurers who were exploring the Western Mines.. They are missing!zts3876e	Dispatch some Milano guards ASAP and find out what happened.zts3877e	Oh my gosh! Do you have any news about these missing adventurers?zts3878e	The most important thing is that we at NosCamp conduct our own investigation right now! We have to make a team now.zts3879e	I will investigate this!zts3880e	I have a bad feeling about this. Please be careful <pname>!zts3881e	I will. For the honor of the NosCamp adventurers, I will give it my best shot!zts3882e	All the best. Hurry. If you are lucky, you might catch up with the Milano Guard team.zts3883e	(Sigh!) It's over now.. I will go back!!zts3884e	Hey you! Adventurer!!zts3885e	Yes? How are you?zts3886e	I am at the entrance of the mine. Can you see me?zts3887e	Hmm. As a matter of fact, I have one thing to ask of you.zts3888e	Ask me about what?zts3889e	Hey.. Why do you frown like that?zts3890e	Well, because I don't know who you are and you are asking me to do something.zts3891e	Haha! You are an adventurer. That means you have to enjoy adventure.. Right?zts3892e	(What. What is he talking about now.)zts3893e	What I mean is, if you are an adventurer, you have to get used to talking to strangers.. Right? Hmm.. Hmm!!zts3894e	(So, what's the big deal if I am an adventurer?) Ah. Yes. Yes. Tell me.zts3895e	Hmm. Frankly speaking, I lost my hammer.zts3896e	Okay.. So??zts3897e	But. That hammer belongs to Bill in the Tool shop.zts3898e	So?zts3899e	Find it for me.zts3900e	What?zts3901e	I might end up losing life that I can't get back.zts3902e	Don't just stand there making faces like an idiot! Hurry up. For the safety of the innocent citizens of Milano!!zts3903e	Good job. I knew you would make it. I am so proud of you. Now, take it to Bill Smith.zts3904e	And why would I take it there?zts3905e	Sure.. If you won't do it, then who else will?zts3906e	(Mumble) What.. Why am I following this idiot's order? He smells like an burnt out fig tree.zts3907e	Well. This hammer. Mr. Mudog told me to pass it on to you.zts3908e	Ah. This hammer is. Give it back right now!!zts3909e	What? Any problem? He lost it somewhere in the mines and asked me to find it for him.zts3910e	He did? I will kill him.zts3911e	What? What do you mean?zts3912e	I said I will kill him and I meant just that!!zts3913e	(Mumble) Well. Time for me to go then. (Scramble)zts3914e	Wow!! You are safe!zts3915e	Haha.. Yes.. Of course.zts3916e	Everyone was concerned about you, because you didn't come back with the other search parties.zts3917e	Ah. that's because Mudog asked me to do something for him.zts3918e	Haha. I bet he gave you a hard time. He's not mean, but.zts3919e	Hmm. Well. you can say that again.zts3920e	Hoho! But. Sorry about this. Mudog asked us to do something again.zts3921e	What?? Him again??zts3922e	You just go there. He will explain. Sorry again. Ah. Take your Kovolt mask along. It will be useful.zts3923e	Hmm.. You still alive.zts3924e	What the heck was with that hammer? I was really scared!!zts3925e	Ahahaha. Hahaha. Sorry about that.zts3926e	That's okay. By the way, what did you ask NosCamp to do?zts3927e	Oh. You are just the right man to take care of this.zts3928e	Well. It was not my intention, but.zts3929e	Ahahaha. Hahaha. Well, I am giving you this as an apology. Take it!zts3930e	Well. What I want you to do is.zts3931e	Tell me.zts3932e	Nowadays, I feel something weird is going on in the mines. The Kovolt miners. They must be planning something.zts3933e	They must be planning something against us.. But nobody is willing to go down and find out. Will you do it?zts3934e	Yes.zts3935e	But how?zts3936e	Disguise yourself as a miner and sneak in on them.zts3937e	What?? Sneak in?? Disguise?? Explain.zts3938e	Hmm.. Don't you know about the Kovolt mask?zts3939e	Yes.. I have the mask.. So, what do I have to do with it?zts3940e	If you put it on, you will look like Kovolt to the others. Isn't it amazing? If you use your head, you can understand this yourself without asking me. Isn't that amazing too?zts3941e	Liar. Are you trying to get me killed?zts3942e	It's true.zts3943e	You really intend to get me killed, don't you?zts3944e	No.. Trust me. If you put on the mask, it will be over. It's such an easy task. What is it now? Will you only believe it if the pretty girl comes and tells you.. to do the same.zts3945e	Hmmm. Then, why don't you do it yourself, if it's so easy?zts3946e	Well.. You have a point there. There is a problem though. The reason why I can't do it is.zts3947e	(Mumble) He. He is sobbing!zts3948e	Sorry. Sorry to ask you for this. But. Please. Do it by all means. For Milano. (Sob Sob)zts3949e	(Mumble) I don't know.. It sounds too dangerous.. But why can't I reject it? Why am I being persuaded?zts3950e	Miner 1: From when?zts3951e	Miner 3: Really. Can we make it?zts3952e	Miner 2: Not more than this. If we survive, we can do anything.zts3953e	Ha. Hahaha. Yes. He's right. Everyone thinks I am a Kovolt.zts3954e	Miner 1: The issue is being inspected in the mines. Many miners have died and have been wounded in that section of the mine. Before this problem gets out of hand, we have to handle it.zts3955e	Miner 2: Yes, you're right. But who can we send to inspect the mines?zts3956e	Miner 3: Let's draw for it.zts3957e	Miner 1: Sounds good. Hey.. You rookie! You, come here.zts3958e	Miner 1: The Kovolts are all equal. No exception. You draw yours.zts3959e	The lucky draw is on.zts3960e	Uh?! It's me!!zts3961e	Miner 2: Rookie!! So sad. All the best, come back alive.zts3962e	(How can't I reject this!!) Yes.zts3963e	Miner: Hurry up. Keep in mind that you don't have enough time.zts3964e	(Sigh!!) .. I managed.. managed to handle this.. I will go back to the village. I am so exhausted.zts3965e	Ah. Excuse me. Do you have some time for me.zts3966e	Ah.. Raul!! (Just what I needed now!!) (Sigh!!)zts3967e	Well. My. My uncle. Because of the Imp. the house. is. completely messed up.zts3968e	Ah. That vicious Imp. Came to my uncle's house. So, my uncle went after it.zts3969e	(Sigh!!) .. Just a moment.. Let me make this short. Your uncle went missing right after he chased the imp.. And you want me to find him??zts3970e	Haha. Yes. That's perfectly right.zts3971e	Ah. But. He is. At the #1 mine. In the Western area. It's. somewhat. dangerous.zts3972e	Yes. Don't worry too much, and wait.. I will check it!zts3973e	This. If you take this. it may. be useful.zts3974e	What is this?zts3975e	Ah. Ah. Ah. Sorry, but the Imp uses the Dark element. So, if you have the resistance power for Dark element, damage will be reduced.zts3976e	If you give me a pair of Adventurer shoes. I will combine. with the other two. (Grumbling)zts3977e	Ah. I will. combine it. Now.zts3978e	If you need a combination later. come to me. I will.zts3979e	Well. thanks.zts3980e	Raul must be concerned. Go back. by the way.zts3981e	I feel like something unpleasant is coming.. Do you have any idea about these things?zts3982e	Well.. Yes.. I do feel like something's weird. I think something big is going to happen soon.zts3983e	Hmmm.. I am so concerned about that. Let's just hope Milano will get through it.zts3984e	Miner 2: The Kovolts will start a general strike! No work anymore!zts3985e	Miner 1: Strike! Strike!zts3986e	What? Ko.. Kovolts are conducting a strike?zts3987e	We have to inform the village of it.zts3988e	What?? The Kovolts have started a strike??zts3989e	Yes. If we had known it earlier, we could have prevented it.zts3990e	Shoot.. anyway, let's break up that strike immediately!zts3991e	Yes, before Sir Lopello knows about this.. If it gets worse, I am dead.zts3992e	Do we have to?? Well.. I don't know!!zts3993e	This is.. It's too cruel. I will tell Mudog about this.zts3994e	Ahhh. It's too late. Now, it's beyond our control.zts3995e	Not just here, but the Kovolts at Mt. Krem have also called a strike. Sir Lopello knows about the strike now.. It's all over.zts3996e	Stupid NosCamp, Jerk Milano guards, What have you done so far? Why did you make it worse?zts3997e	(He is losing it) There must be a reason. We have to find out now. If we are lucky, we might find the clue.zts3998e	Haha. Hahaha. It's all over. What clue. I don't care anymore. I am finished now. All my savings. my pension and my cozy life for the future. Everything's gone away!zts3999e	(Mumble) Has he gone insane? I guess it's useless to talk to Mudog anymore. I have to inspect this myself.. There must be some reason.zts4000e	I lost everything.zts4001e	A request from the Kovolts. It's not ridiculous at all. There's some possibility of compromise. I have to meet Eril now.zts4002e	When they were talking about that issue.zts4003e	I got it. I will report it to Sir Lopello now.zts4004e	Yes.. Please.zts4005e	Hehe.. Trust NosCamp.. I hope this relieves some of your concerns. Right?zts4006e	Haha.. Yes.. Now, I can relax.zts4007e	Haha.. But, at NosCamp we can't relax at all. Here, another mission!!zts4008e	Okay.. I think I finished most of the missions, so can I go back?zts4009e	Hello. Did you get any message from Sir Lopello?zts4010e	The war will continue.. People say Sir Lopello and Milano will never forgive the Kovolts.zts4011e	We, NosCamp, have to follow the decision of Lopello. Right?zts4012e	Hmmm.. It's the life.zts4013e	Unfairness? It's the essence of life. love and justice? Haha. it's nothing but a mirage.zts4014e	The battlefield with the law of the jungle. That's the life!zts4015e	But, sadly, sometimes human beings are against nature's law. And they say that people are equal.zts4016e	But an idea is an idea.. It's a dream that never comes true. Haha.. You dreamer. Your dream is the seed of your tragedy. Do you know that?zts4017e	The stupid creatures who follow the mirage. Your name is human being!!zts4018e	So.. what do you want to say?zts4019e	Hmmm.. I was fired today.zts4020e	Ah. that deep. wait. So, it was just complaining!zts4021e	The world has gone blind. It does not see a person with great willingness. Now I arise, to reveal my dream and the earth will just watch, including you stupid humans.zts4022e	(Mumble) More than ridiculous.zts4023e	Hmmm.. But the finishing work was not good.zts4024e	Are you teasing me?zts4025e	Hmmm. This is.zts4026e	It's great. Yes, it's. wow!zts4027e	What? Is it that great?zts4028e	Hmmm. Don't you see that. It's like a pig wearing a pearl necklace. Now, I will give you the other gift, so take it and go back.zts4029e	What. is this?zts4030e	You don't have any intention of learning by yourself, do you? Won't you even touch the Menu window?zts4031e	Haha.. It looks fun.zts4032e	What?zts4033e	Sounds like Mozart's music. Hmm.. it's beyond words to describe its beauty.zts4034e	My heart can't release you!!zts4035e	What sound? I can't hear anything.zts4036e	what do you mean?zts4037e	Hurry up. Time doesn't wait for us.zts4038e	We'd better look around more.zts4039e	Hmmm. I feel something weird.zts4040e	Any problem?zts4041e	I came to take the weapon that the guard left here.zts4042e	Here.zts4043e	(Mumble) Still don't talk much.zts4044e	Hey. You.zts4045e	Well. We feel like something strange is going on around here. Can you help us?zts4046e	Sure!zts4047e	Sorry, but we need more hands. Not much that you have to do. We just need more people to search around.zts4048e	The enemies are getting stronger!zts4049e	I found the [black slate] from the dead body of a Devil creature.zts4050e	What is this? Strange letters. Hmmm.. Mr. Sellbig may be able to translate this.zts4051e	Sellbig: Hmmm.. Interesting letters. Just a moment. I think I can understand what's written here.zts4052e	It was found on a Devil creature. What does it say?zts4053e	Hmmm.zts4054e	(Silence for the time being)zts4055e	We have to inform the citizens. The Devils are going to invade our village through chasm of TimeSpace in large numbers.zts4056e	What?zts4057e	Suddenly Milano becomes fussy.zts4058e	Guard: Creatures are invading!! Creatures are all over the place!! Everyone come together fast!!zts4059e	Already started?zts4060e	I will go there too!zts4061e	Ahhhh. we totally lost!zts4062e	But again, most of the creatures went to back to the chasm.zts4063e	Yeah, but that was because they had stolen enough. But, some of the creatures are still here. They may attack the citizens.zts4064e	I will stay here.zts4065e	No, you can't do this on your own!zts4066e	Well. But I will try, because the guards have to take care of the wounded citizens.zts4067e	Sorry.zts4068e	(Sigh!!) Is it enough?zts4069e	Hey! Are you safe?zts4070e	How's the village? Is it getting repaired?zts4071e	Yes, the disaster done is not as much as I expected it to be.zts4072e	Because of the guards, the citizens were able to run away quickly.zts4073e	Haha. yes. It was good to have drills.zts4074e	Welcome.zts4075e	You look so tired.zts4076e	I got demoted.zts4077e	Hmm.. Sorry about that.zts4078e	Do you know Rhain?zts4079e	No?zts4080e	He went there a long time ago.. but no news since then. Please find him.zts4081e	One more accident and I will be fired. Hmmph.zts4082e	Don't.. don't cry.. I will find him!zts4083e	Go North. He heard that a wounded soldier was there and he went to cure him.zts4084e	Yes.. I see.zts4085e	Ah. Life is so tough.zts4086e	Ah.. You saved me. Thanks. Rhain, fool! He better not come in my sigh again!zts4087e	Yes.. Hahaha.zts4088e	Stupid guards. They don't know what is possible and not possible. They just make a fuss.zts4089e	Shut up!! You big mouth!!zts4090e	Aaaargh!zts4091e	H.. hi.. How are you?zts4092e	Is it you? Mudog's trouble maker?zts4093e	What? T.. trouble maker?zts4094e	I heard from this big-mouth that because of you, the Kovolts are making a big problem. So, how will you handle this?zts4095e	What.. what problem?zts4096e	The #2 mine is under my management, but even that is all screwed up. Take the responsibility. You aren't going to run away, are you?zts4097e	No.. no.. I won't..zts4098e	Wipe them out. That dirty Kovolts species.zts4099e	I am back. Uh? Where's Mr. Krispo?zts4100e	Hahaha. It's a problem. Krispo. he is.zts4101e	What happened?zts4102e	Bwahahaha! He went to check if you were doing well and was caught by the Kovolt demonstrators. So it's. Oh my God. Hahahaha.zts4103e	Really, it's such a big problem. Because the mines are so vast and complicated, we couldn't meet each other.zts4104e	Puhahahah! Yes. I guess so. He was so unlucky. How miserable he's. Hahahah!!zts4105e	(Mumble) He is never concerned.zts4106e	Even though he doesn't speak gently, Hmmm. I hope nothing terrible happens to him. Hahahaha.zts4107e	I will go there!zts4108e	No. It's too dangerous!zts4109e	So, I have to go there!zts4110e	Hey.. No way, why do you risk your life??zts4111e	I will go there!!zts4112e	No.. Stay here!! Save your life!!zts4113e	Shoot!! The Kovolts keep chasing us!zts4114e	Shoot!!zts4115e	Calm down!!zts4116e	Ah! Commander!!zts4117e	All of the Milano guards are coming here! Let's attack the base of the Kovolts.zts4118e	I will kick the asses of those Kovolts who beat me back then.zts4119e	Please. calm down!!zts4120e	Hey.. Krispo.. Now, paying back that little anger is not an issue.zts4121e	Little anger? What are you talking about you stupid guards!! If you weren't so lazy, I wouldn't have had that terrible experience!!zts4122e	Please!!zts4123e	The commander of the guards punched him!! Krispo passed out!zts4124e	We will march to the Southern East in haste. Hey, you join us as soon as you are ready!!zts4125e	Hmmm. Fighting again.zts4126e	What? What did you say?zts4127e	No.. No sir.zts4128e	Hey.. Welcome.. But you seem to have something funny in your hand?zts4129e	What? Ah.. this?zts4130e	Yes.. that's.. a Fairy!zts4131e	Ah. this shiny strange creature. is. a Fairy.zts4132e	No, it's not a strange creature, but it is a mysterious one. It gives new powers to its master. Let me briefly explain. Well, Mr. Vellochika is the expert in this field, but let me try and explain it to you first anyway.zts4133e	Wow! It's a fairy!!zts4134e	Hahah.. According to Eril, Vellochika is the expert on Fairies.zts4135e	Vellochika: Of course I am! The Fairy is a friend of Vellochika!! But, hmmm.. This fairy has a lot of complaints about it's master!!zts4136e	What? How do you know that?zts4137e	Hey. Don't you feel the emotion of your Fairy. Stone cold!!zts4138e	Hahaha. Yes. You may be right.zts4139e	Now, look at the Fairy. Is it shining? It looks very tame, but it's not. It's very very picky!! It's very greedy for food. If it goes hungry, it becomes very sad. Therefore, you have to always take care of it with food. Don't forget that!zts4140e	Hello there!! You.. the one with the pure soul!!zts4141e	Your eyes reveal much, come here and hold my hands.zts4142e	Are you calling me??zts4143e	Yes.. The window of ignorance is now open. Listen to your heart, come and touch my hands.zts4144e	Are you sure you got the right person?zts4145e	Please, just come here and touch my hands.zts4146e	I do not know you, why are you calling me??zts4147e	The cursed sun is rising on the prairie of the morning!!zts4148e	What the hell are you talking about!!zts4149e	The Devil's followers are gathering around the cursed sun!zts4150e	So you predict that something bad is going to happen?zts4151e	Exactly!zts4153e	Because only a hero can stop the darkness.zts4154e	(Mumble) This guy really freaks me out!!zts4155e	My God!! It's endless!!zts4156e	Is it still going on?zts4157e	I guess it's almost over.zts4158e	Whoa!! The Devils are making a big circle!!zts4159e	Oh my God!! What is that thing in the center?zts4160e	I have never seen something so horrible!! I have to report this to NosCamp.zts4161e	(.. Reporting what has happened.)zts4162e	Hmmm.. This sounds very serious.zts4163e	It is. I wonder if we can handle it.zts4164e	We have to ask Sir Lopello for backup. I heard that his knights are near the bridge of Southern Milano. Go there and explain the situation to him.zts4165e	Lopello's knights?zts4166e	Yes, his private guard. They were dispatched to support the Milano defense.zts4167e	Yes.. But they were sent to break the Kovolt strike.zts4168e	But the Milano guards cannot handle this on their own.zts4169e	Ya, we know that.zts4170e	Yes? Yes.zts4171e	Anyway, is that all? Then this meeting is over.zts4172e	.. You know its urgent!! So why aren't you doing anything about it??!!zts4173e	Be quiet!! We will act only after we receive orders from the Commander. To us, orders are more important than life itself!! Without official orders from the Commander, we will not take action.zts4174e	I guess I need to meet the commander then, where is he?zts4175e	Knights: He's on patrol now. He must be on the Morning Prairie.zts4176e	Who are you?zts4177e	Are you the Commander of Sir Lopello's knights?zts4178e	Actually, I am the Commander of the 3rd Squad for Sir Lopello. What can I do for you?zts4179e	I have urgent news for you.zts4180e	I know.zts4181e	Will you please help us? The Milano guards can't handle this on their own.zts4182e	No I won't. (Grinning)zts4183e	What!! Why Not??zts4184e	It's a secret.zts4185e	(Mumble) He's hiding something.zts4186e	What beautiful weather we have today, is there anything to eat?zts4187e	Hmm. (Mumble) Let's feed him, maybe we can get something out of him.zts4188e	Yes. It's lunch time. what are you doing?? Pay more attention when you are guarding me!zts4189e	Guarding you??zts4190e	Yes. stay and watch me enjoy my lunch in style.zts4191e	..zts4192e	Oohhho!! Did I make you upset?? Hahahahahahah.zts4193e	No. Not at all.zts4194e	Aaahhhh, I'm stuffed.zts4195e	Did you eat well?zts4196e	Hmmm. My cigar. where's my cigar? Did you see my cigar case?zts4197e	No I haven't.zts4198e	I saw a fox strolling around. It probably stole my case. Kill the fox!! I have given you an order to kill it!!zts4199e	Done.zts4200e	Heh heh heh heh.zts4201e	(Mumble) I have a feeling I'm going to have to do something stupid again.zts4202e	Heh heh heh heh.zts4203e	Yes. is there anything else?zts4204e	No. but I guess you want me to say something.zts4205e	It's Lopello!!zts4206e	That's the reason why we cannot work with you.zts4207e	What do you mean?zts4208e	Lopello prevents us from marching with you.zts4209e	If you're smart, you'll understand what I'm saying. Now leave!!zts4210e	By the way do you know a guy called Kevin?zts4211e	No.zts4212e	I heard he's patrolling this area. Meet him, he might be able to help you.zts4213e	Hmm. There is something fishy about this. I got a bad feeling about this guy. but I still need to meet Kevin.zts4214e	Kevin. not a very friendly person.zts4215e	Hello. how are you?zts4216e	You again??!!zts4217e	Well. about Kevin.zts4218e	I want to know about him.zts4219e	I don't know anything about him!zts4220e	But he's your colleague?zts4221e	I don't want to talk about it, go away!!zts4222e	Kevin is regarded as one of the best knights in Lopello's Guard. He's amazing.zts4223e	Lopello's knights.. Who are they?zts4224e	Sir Lopello's mercenary soldiers. It is an official group of brave and strong men. Milano guards can't be a part of it.zts4225e	Hmmm.. I heard something very interesting.zts4226e	Something interesting?zts4227e	Well.. The Commander said that because of Sir Lopello, they will not help Noscamp and the Milano Guards.zts4228e	Well like I said, they will fight only for money. So without the order of their employer, they will not fight.zts4229e	But.. Why did Sir Lopello not want them to fight?zts4230e	I don't know, nobody knows, unless you're one of the secret committee members in the meeting of the knights.zts4231e	Secret committee??zts4232e	The orders come from the secret committee. I don't know anything more on that.zts4233e	I need to find out, I will have to find the secret meeting place.zts4234e	Easier said than done.zts4235e	Please help me.. Lopello's knights.. They said they came here to fight the Devils, but they aren't doing anything about it.zts4236e	Yeah, you're right.zts4237e	Help Me!!zts4238e	Hmmm.. There is this person called Bill Smith. He's the one in touch with Lopello's knights, maybe he can help.zts4239e	Thank you!!zts4240e	No problem, I'm sorry I couldn't help you anymore.zts4241e	Hello, can I ask you a question?zts4242e	Yes?zts4243e	Please tell me about the secret committee meeting of Lopello.zts4244e	Don't know anything about it.zts4245e	Nothing at all??zts4246e	(Mumble) I can't talk about it here.zts4247e	(Voice out of somewhere)zts4248e	Hey you there!!zts4249e	You want to know about the secret committee meeting of Lopello?zts4250e	Do you want to know?zts4251e	Haha.. Morgan Smith, I am the best source of intelligence in Milano.zts4252e	How much do you want?zts4254e	Here it is!zts4255e	Hey that's too low!!zts4256e	Too low, but I guess it will have to do.zts4257e	(Sigh!!)zts4258e	Yes that's enough.zts4259e	Now please tell me!!zts4260e	What?zts4261e	ABOUT THE MEETING!!zts4262e	Why?zts4263e	WHY?? Because I paid you for it!!zts4264e	Hmm. well.zts4265e	I can't, because that information is worth so much more.zts4266e	You need more??zts4267e	Hahahah. Well. I changed my mind.zts4268e	I'll call you and tell you later.zts4269e	Aaaaahhhhhhh!!zts4270e	What??!!zts4271e	Tell me! Tell me!! Tell me!!zts4272e	Stop.. stop!!zts4273e	Tell me now!! Now!!zts4274e	Fine!! I'll tell you, stop bugging me!!zts4275e	Hmm. I need to find a clue, but where do I start?zts4276e	Ah! Morgan Smith!!zts4277e	No!! Not him!!zts4278e	(Sigh) But I can't find him.zts4279e	Eeeeeeeekk!!zts4280e	I'm sorry, I need to ask you a question.zts4281e	I'm the best source of intelligence in Milano. If you want information, let's keep our differences aside and talk. If I see a profit for myself then I'm willing to talk to even to a Demon.zts4282e	Hehe. Yeah.zts4283e	(Explaining to Morgan what happened so far.)zts4284e	Oh! That's interesting!!zts4285e	Do you feel anything?zts4286e	No.zts4287e	Don't feel too bad.zts4288e	I can help, but first you'll need 'chasing perfume'.zts4289e	Chasing perfume??zts4290e	Ask Raul.zts4291e	(Mumble) Chasing perfume. Used while chasing someone.zts4292e	Do you have chasing perfume?zts4293e	Raul: Hmmmm, let me check.zts4294e	(After a few hours.)zts4295e	Here it is!zts4296e	It's just a book!!zts4297e	Well, I don't have chasing perfume on me right now, but I can make it with the recipes. It's made of.zts4298e	First, I need. and with this I can make. (Mumble)zts4299e	Here. (Mumble)zts4300e	Thank you!!zts4301e	Nice! You got it. Well done!zts4302e	So what are you going to do with this?zts4303e	Oh, this is the price for talking to you.. Hehehe.zts4304e	You're cheating me again??!!zts4305e	Hey calm down. I was just kidding. Listen up.zts4306e	Go on.zts4307e	You know the knight Kevin right? He drops by my shop everyday.zts4308e	So?zts4309e	I'll spill some perfume onto his sword case.zts4310e	You only have to follow him.zts4311e	I want to know why the knights are acting weird, not just Kevin himself.zts4312e	Idiot!! Fine, I'll tell you more. Kevin does.zts4313e	Doesn't get along with his commanders. He always complains.zts4314e	So?zts4315e	Well.. As you know, secrecy is of utmost priority in his team. So he's the only man who will talk.zts4316e	Get him to talk, whether you bribe him or force him, its not my business. All the best!!zts4317e	Okay, by the way.zts4318e	More questions?zts4319e	That chasing perfume.. Is it strong enough for me to follow?zts4320e	You ask too many questions!! Here is a catch net. Near the temple you'll find a bug called 'Sniffer'. Use the perfume with that bug.zts4321e	Kevin just left. Looks like he's headed to the Morning Prairie. Hahaha. Now let's give this perfume a little test.zts4322e	Oh no, I lost him but I still have the trace of the perfume.zts4323e	Wait!!zts4324e	Stop there, Kevin doesn't want you to follow him.zts4325e	Where is he? Where is Kevin?zts4326e	He said that he smells something funny from his sword or something.zts4327e	Heh.. He came to know that!zts4328e	Leave him alone, if you touch a lone wolf, it will bite.zts4329e	I know. by the way who are you?zts4330e	I'm the warehouse manager Jerico.zts4331e	Pleased to meet you.zts4332e	Lovely day isn't it? Forget about him, let's hunt here for a while.zts4333e	What's that shiny thing on the ground?zts4334e	This. This is the helmet of a Milano Guard.zts4335e	Something happened, I will follow the foot prints.zts4336e	Guard 1: Thanks a million.zts4337e	Guard 2: You saved our lives.zts4338e	You guys were lucky!!zts4339e	Guard 1: By the way.zts4340e	Guard 1: When we were stuck, this stranger came to us.zts4341e	Guard 2: He said that you will come to save us, so don't worry. Isn't that strange?zts4342e	Who was this stranger?zts4343e	Guard 1: It was too dark to see his face. But he asked me to give you this letter.zts4344e	(Small folded letter)zts4345e	(I will wait for you in the South.. From your enemy)zts4346e	Guard 1: Your face looks pale.. What happened?zts4347e	I want to avoid it, but I need to settle something first.zts4348e	Guard 1: Hmmmm.zts4349e	Guard 2: Ah!! Yes!! I remember Jerico.zts4350e	Guard 1: Right.. Jerico.. People called him 'Rico Steel Sword'.zts4351e	Jerico?zts4352e	Guard 1: Yes, he was the most formidable fighter in Milano. Talk to him, maybe he can help.zts4353e	(Mumble) I thought he was a simple warehouse manager.zts4354e	You are the famous hero 'Rico Steel Sword'!!zts4355e	I was.zts4356e	No, you are!!zts4357e	Those were the old days, I have forgotten all about them.zts4358e	Mr.Jerico.. Please help me.zts4359e	Are you asking for help from a warehouse manager?zts4360e	I want to be your student.zts4361e	Hahahahhahaha!!zts4362e	What's so funny??zts4363e	You're talking about my old days. Not very good for you.zts4364e	Ask me with your heart. Let's see if I can be moved by it.zts4365e	Uhh uhh!! (Gasping)zts4366e	What's wrong with you?? You expect to move me with small wooden bricks?zts4367e	I.. I have to fight Kevin.zts4368e	You want to die so badly??zts4369e	Milano is full of Devils and the conflict with the Kovolts is escalating. Milano is facing a crisis and we need heroes like Kevin.zts4370e	Kevin is not interested.zts4371e	I will force him to be interested.zts4372e	And you're going to force him?zts4373e	Yes!!zts4374e	Do you mean it?zts4375e	Of course!!zts4376e	This is very interesting!!zts4377e	I wonder if you can force Kevin to join you.zts4378e	..zts4379e	I will give you 3 difficult missions. If you fail, you will die.zts4380e	I won't!!zts4381e	It's a piece of cake.zts4382e	Yes I finished all of them.zts4383e	Congratulations, you did it!!zts4384e	Thank you!!zts4385e	We are done here, you can go now!zts4386e	I will defeat Kevin, I promise.zts4387e	Tell me the results of the fight, once you're done.zts4388e	I will, thank you for your help.zts4389e	Hahaha.zts4390e	Hahahah. Bwhahahaha. You make me laugh. I've never seen anyone as stupid as you are. Ahahahaha!!zts4391e	Mr. Jerico!!zts4392e	Hahaha.. Get the heck out of my face. Wake up and come back again.. Hahahaha!!zts4393e	Welcome to NosCamp. We are so busy preparing for the war!!zts4394e	Hi.. How are you?zts4395e	For our honor, Sir Lopello dispatched military supplies to us. In return for his hospitality, we have to work harder!!zts4396e	(Mumble) Eril.. looks a little angry.. I must be careful.zts4398e	Good job.zts4399e	Leave it there. (Grumbling)zts4400e	Hi, how are you? I came to get some steel.zts4401e	Do you have any problem?zts4402e	Krispo got promoted.zts4403e	Ah. Hahahah.zts4404e	Now, he is my boss.zts4405e	Ah.. Yes.. he is.zts4406e	Leave me alone.. Bye.zts4407e	(Mumble) Hmmm. I guess I have to find it myself.zts4408e	(Sniff) Well done.. You can go now.zts4409e	(Sigh!!) You are late.zts4410e	Ex.. Excuse me. I have finished my part.zts4411e	Excuse. me.zts4412e	This is an order from Sir Lopello. He said all the adventurers of NosCamp have to lead from the front lines and conquer the Kovolts.zts4413e	It turned out to be like that.zts4414e	I am so sorry.zts4415e	Ms. Eril.zts4416e	Here you go!!zts4417e	I feel so grateful to Ms. Eril. You really are the kindest lady.zts4418e	Yes. but.zts4419e	Ms. Eril. Have a big smile on your face. You don't have to feel sorry for me. You couldn't help it. We are just one of the families living in NosCamp.zts4420e	Really..zts4421e	Cheer up!zts4422e	Yes.. Thank you. Thank you!!zts4423e	(Mumble) Eril was smiling!!zts4424e	Knights: The battle will be on. Everyone get together.zts4425e	Knights and Demons. Any relationship?zts4426e	(Explaining to Eril and Sellbig that the suspicious about the relationship between the knights and the Demons.)zts4427e	Is it. true?zts4428e	Yes. I don't know the reason, but I saw it.zts4429e	(Sigh!!) And then, we have to report it to the Milano guards.zts4430e	Yes. We do.zts4431e	Now, the Milano guards have setup camp at the entrance of the Fernon temple. Meet Commander Raymond. Hurry up.zts4432e	Oh.. Who are you?zts4433e	I am an adventurer of NosCamp.zts4434e	(Telling Raymond about the suspicious relationship between the knights and the Demons.)zts4435e	Hmmm. It's a big problem, but the bigger problem is that we don't have any evidence.zts4436e	No. we don't.zts4437e	Without evidence, what you are saying doesn't hold much ground as truth.zts4438e	Suddenly outside the camps, a big fuss erupts.zts4439e	Attack of the Kovolts!! The Milano guards have to support Lopello's knights from behind!!zts4440e	Hmmm. Let's talk about it later. But, the combat situation is urgent now. Can you help me?zts4441e	Ah.. Yes.zts4442e	Commander. he is?zts4443e	Yes, he is a NosCamp Adventurer.zts4444e	You NosCamp losers! (Looking at the Commander) They are cowardly and sometimes side with the Kovolts. You'd better not trust him!zts4445e	What are you talking about!!zts4446e	It's a matter that we have to judge, it's enough for now. The battle is about to begin.zts4447e	Kovolt soldier: Gray storm approaches. Now, the human beings are finished!zts4448e	Hmmm.. It's so lucky to finish the battle without much disaster.zts4449e	Yes.zts4450e	I can see the concern on his face. War devastates people.zts4451e	Commander.zts4452e	Yes. I didn't give you the answer.zts4453e	I heard that, Adventurer. But you think it's reasonable? Our glorious knights brought Demons?zts4454e	Hmmm. Be quiet.zts4455e	But Commander!!zts4456e	Okay.. Okay.. My fellow Adventurer. I will trust you and will keep my eyes on the knights. But, don't expect us to take any action now.zts4457e	Until we have the critical evidence.zts4458e	Commander!!zts4459e	You know what I mean?zts4460e	Yes.. Yes!!zts4461e	Don't know why, but Baymen's eyes are blazing.zts4462e	I've been waiting.zts4463e	It's useless.zts4464e	It's the same to us. We might be arrested for spreading false rumors.zts4465e	(Sigh!!) I don't know what is happening.zts4466e	Cheer up! It's not finished yet.zts4467e	(At this moment, some noise comes from the village.)zts4468e	I think it's a large scale battle against the Kovolts.zts4469e	The Milano guard has to take responsibility for this!!zts4470e	Raymond: ..zts4471e	The knights have had such a huge disaster because the Milano guards retreated suddenly. Now, we don't know where they are!!zts4472e	Why do you keep silent!! Commander!!zts4473e	.. Did you forget that the Milano guards don't belong to Lopello?zts4474e	We have the right to be independent. Don't talk about it any more. You may demoralize the soldiers.zts4475e	..zts4476e	And you adventurer.zts4477e	Yes.. Yes?zts4478e	Can you find out where the lost knights are? We are short of hands right now.zts4479e	Yes.. I can.zts4480e	Here's a trace. Over there?zts4481e	Here.. below this log.zts4482e	Note: All knights should go through the mines and get together!!zts4483e	Ah. you are here.zts4484e	Haha.. We are still safe. Lopello's knights are not that weak to be defeated by the Kovolts.zts4485e	Now, let's go back to base camp!zts4486e	We can't. Now, Koaren's partisans are ambushing. We may suffer a lot of damage if we move now.zts4487e	Hmmm.zts4488e	Well. We have plenty of supplies.. So, we can stay here for the time being. No need to worry. By the way, give this document to Baymen.zts4489e	It's information on the supportive troops. Don't lose it!!zts4490e	Hmmm. A document on the supportive troops?zts4491e	Baymen reads through the document.zts4492e	(Mumble) Baymen's face looks rigid.zts4493e	One favor for me.zts4494e	You.. get this.zts4495e	This is. it looks like powder?zts4496e	It's magic powder. You have to spread it on a red plate.. You may find the plate nearby.zts4497e	But.. what does it mean?zts4498e	You will see. Do NOT make a mistake!!zts4499e	What is that disgusting noise?zts4500e	Voice of guard: Attack!! Koaren's attack!!zts4501e	What the heck.. What exactly does Lopello have in mind? How did he compromise with the Demons?zts4502e	.. Now, I, Baymen, will take over command. So watch your mouth!zts4503e	Ex.. excuse me..zts4504e	You.. You!!zts4505e	Why? Why are you surprised?zts4506e	You successfully avoided the curse of the plate.zts4507e	Now, Lopello's knights has commanding rights over all the soldiers in the war against Koaren. That includes NosCamp adventurers, too!!zts4508e	Oh.. Yes. I know an appropriate role for you.zts4509e	What is that?zts4510e	The supplies from NosCamp were not enough, so all the swords of the knights have become rusty!! We cannot proceed the war with this!! Now I order you to produce 99 swords for the knights.zts4511e	If you can't make it.zts4512e	Yes. yes. and then?zts4513e	I will punish you by military law!!zts4514e	(Mumble) He must hate me deeply.zts4515e	Swords of knights?zts4516e	Yes.. Hurry.. I need 99 swords.zts4517e	Bleh! That's impossible!zts4518e	But. please. please.zts4519e	I don't have the seal of the knights. Without it, I cannot make it.zts4520e	But. please..zts4521e	No.. period!zts4522e	(Voice of Baymen echoing)zts4523e	I will punish you by military law!!zts4524e	Hey. the Commander ordered this?zts4525e	Please. Is it really impossible?zts4526e	No.. It's not possible.zts4527e	(Sigh)zts4531e	Please.. Tell me how to make it.zts4533e	Ple.. ea.. se.zts4534e	What?zts4535e	How to make the seal!!zts4536e	Ah.. Good idea.zts4537e	Please.zts4538e	Hmmm.. If you go to the Western mines, someone will come to you.zts4539e	That's all?zts4541e	??: Are you the guy Morgan introduced?zts4542e	Who are you?zts4543e	??: Bring me the heart of the Red Clay Golem in the closed mine.zts4544e	What? What did you say?zts4545e	(Silent)zts4546e	He disappeared.zts4547e	(Sigh!!) So scared.. I will hurry and bring it.zts4548e	??: Hah! Well done. With this, I can break into Lopello's house with ease.zts4549e	What? What do you mean? Do you intend to steal the seal from him?zts4550e	??: Nobody can duplicate the seal. Anyway, wait some more. It will take a little more time. And I will give it to Morgan.zts4551e	(Silent again.)zts4552e	Dis.. disappeared.zts4553e	Put him in jail now!!zts4554e	What? Why??zts4555e	Did you make 99 swords?zts4556e	No. Not yet. but.zts4557e	Right now, imprison him!zts4558e	Just.. just a moment!! I need more time!!zts4559e	(Suddenly, a fussy noise comes from the outside.)zts4560e	Guard: Enemy!! The Koarens are invading us again!zts4561e	Hmmm. He is so lucky.zts4562e	The enemy has. allies.zts4563e	If it's about the sword.. I will bring them!!zts4564e	Baymen!! Don't hurry to make a decision!zts4565e	Sir, I don't want to say this.. but, mind your own business, please. I will hang him up tonight.zts4566e	Please, Baymen. He's still young. Give him a break.zts4567e	You always want to be.. promoted..zts4568e	What do you mean? It's your own right to decide promotion.zts4569e	You will be.. So, save him.zts4570e	Commander!!zts4571e	Hmmm.. You think that the adventurer is worth that?zts4572e	Everyone is worth. And so are you.zts4573e	Bleh. You are too proud of yourself. Okay.. anyway, it's fine.zts4574e	Thanks.zts4575e	Hey!! I will give you one more day.zts4576e	..zts4577e	Now, you can leave!zts4578e	You will feel sorry about this!!zts4579e	Hahaha!!zts4580e	Here are 99 swords!zts4581e	Ah.. Already?zts4582e	Hahaha.. And I already returned the seal.zts4583e	Haha. Hahaha.zts4584e	By the way.zts4585e	Rumor has it that the Demons are in Sir Lopello's mansion.zts4586e	Said to be working with GrrKenko.zts4587e	What? That's ridiculous!!zts4588e	I don't mind if it's ridiculous or not. Hahaha!!zts4589e	Put him in jail now!!zts4590e	No. Here, I brought them.zts4591e	Wow. You made it. Hahaha.zts4592e	Hahaha! You. Hmmm. made it.zts4593e	Thanks to the Commander's help. And Commander, I have one thing to tell you in private.zts4594e	Telling the story of the Demon to Raymond.zts4595e	Hmm I have to tell this story to our soldiers in the line of fire against the Kovolts now.zts4596e	What will happen?zts4597e	Hmmm.. I don't know why Lopello did this. Anyway, instead of fighting and making sacrifices, let's hold it and see what's coming.zts4598e	Sooner or later, this balance of power will be broken and the war will be over.zts4599e	Hey. Baymen!!zts4600e	Haha.zts4601e	(Mumble) Insane.zts4602e	(Telling the story of the Demon to Romanson.)zts4603e	What. does it mean?zts4604e	Trust me. I am not telling you a lie.zts4605e	So.. So what are we to do?zts4606e	Avoid the useless combat.zts4607e	Hahaha.. useless combat? We are soldiers. And all combat is useful.zts4608e	Everyone, listen! We will attack the enemy from a passage to their side. Be ready to attack.zts4609e	Sir!!zts4610e	And you!! You are assigned to be a scout. Figure out the way for the attack. Hurry up!zts4611e	Did you forget? Sir Lopello said the Milano guards and Noscamp have to obey the knights!!zts4612e	Ah.. Yes.. I understand.zts4613e	Now, let's go back to base camp!zts4614e	What the!zts4615e	Calm down.zts4616e	will kill all Demons.. (Grumble) .zts4617e	Please calm down.zts4618e	You! Get out of my face. Go to NosCamp or hell!!zts4619e	Hey.. It's a big problem!!zts4620e	What? What is it?zts4621e	NosCamp.. It was ordered to shut down!!zts4622e	What??zts4623e	The other day, the seal of Sir Lopello was stolen and the thief was. an adventurer of NosCamp.zts4624e	What! No! No! I need. I need to meet Morgan!zts4625e	Haha!! Long time no see!zts4626e	What happened? Didn't you return the seal?zts4627e	Haha! I thought it was returned, but because you asked, I guess not.zts4628e	What?? What are you going to do? How did it happen?zts4629e	Hahaha.. It was you that asked me to steal the seal. You made this!!zts4630e	I am not asking you who made this. I am asking you how to handle this!!zts4631e	Hahaha. If you only have to.zts4632e	Tell me!! Do you have a good idea?zts4634e	Haha.. Try.zts4635e	Okay. With this, we can meet Sir Crescendo.zts4636e	Sir Crescendo?zts4637e	He is the right arm of Lopello and he likes bribes. That's why he likes me so much.. Haha!!zts4638e	(Mumble) Can.. can be.zts4641e	Commission.zts4642e	This is the commission for the broker.zts4643e	That much? Who's the broker?zts4644e	Me of course.zts4645e	Okay. anyway, but it's not enough. Hmm. Have you heard about.zts4646e	the Bloody-shining Ruby?zts4647e	What is that?zts4648e	It's a beautiful gem that can touch Sir Crescendo.. If we have it, everything will be easy.zts4649e	Hmmm. If it's a gem, I will ask Mr. Celloin.zts4650e	The Bloody-shining Ruby. Everyone who knows about gems knows about this. It's the gem of gems, you know?zts4651e	How can we find it?zts4652e	Well.. The Bloody-shining Ruby is made from bloody rubies. However..zts4653e	This bloody ruby is rare and can be extracted from vampie leech.zts4654e	Vampie leech?zts4655e	Yes. It's also so rare leech that people are not allowed to catch it. But if you need it desperately, I can tell you the place to get it.zts4656e	Yes. Please. I will catch it!zts4657e	But. I can't guarantee it because it's so rare.zts4658e	Oh my God.. You made this!!zts4659e	(Celloin is making a Bloody-shining Ruby.)zts4660e	Yes.. Here it is. Isn't it fabulous!!zts4661e	Hahaha.. Now everything's ready, so believe me!!zts4662e	Are you sure everything is perfectly ready?zts4663e	Don't you know me? Don't worry!zts4664e	(Mumble) Yes.. I know you too well. That's the problem.zts4665e	Good news!! With the generosity of Sir Crescendo, the punishment to NosCamp was withdrawn.zts4666e	Hahaha.. Yes.. I am so happy.zts4667e	But, it's only under one condition.zts4668e	Condition?zts4669e	Yes. We must collect information on the Kovolt Kenko in Kreano.zts4670e	Hmmmm. Do you have any idea?zts4671e	Hmmm. Rumor has it that the Demons are compromising with Kenko for something.zts4672e	What? What do you mean? The Demons must be. with Lopello.zts4673e	I don't know.zts4674e	(Telling Eril what happened so far.)zts4675e	It was true!! I will report it to Sir Lopello and NosCamp.zts4676e	And then, I will inform the knights and Milano guards of this!zts4677e	If the Demon has planned to give the Milano area to Kenko, the alliance between the Demons and Lopello must be broken.zts4678e	Yes. It must be.zts4679e	(Telling Raymond and Baymen what happened so far.)zts4680e	(Sigh!!) So, it was like this.zts4681e	Those dirty Demons.. They cheated us!! Dirty species!!zts4682e	Calm down. As we lost to the Demons, Koaren also lost to Kenko. It may be the best time to finish the war.zts4683e	Maybe.zts4684e	We will handle the alliance with the Demons later. Right now, treating Koaren is more urgent. Baymen, give the order.zts4685e	Yes Sir.zts4686e	If finishing the war is most urgent, then I will be at the front. Let me help put an end to this!!zts4687e	That's enough. Now, let's launch a full-scale attack! Baymen!!zts4688e	Yes Sir!zts4689e	The enemy is running away.zts4690e	This way?zts4691e	Uhh?? Where did they run off to?zts4692e	Now I know how KrrKoaren and Kenel disappeared. (Sigh!) will meet them soon.zts4693e	Kenko. what are they thinking? We may get some clues if we search around here.zts4694e	What. What is this? Some mysterious power is coming from this.zts4695e	Maybe Raul knows about this.zts4696e	Raul: Hmmm. This is.zts4697e	Do you know what it is?zts4698e	Ahhh.. Sorry, but I don't know.. But it doesn't seem to be precious.zts4699e	Really?zts4700e	Hmmm. This is.zts4701e	Anything special?zts4702e	Well.. I don't know.zts4703e	Hmmm.zts4704e	But.zts4705e	There is a message is on it.zts4706e	What? What is it?zts4707e	2nd floor of the deserted mines. The sculpture with the open mouth. Touch the necklace of the Hell dog. The door will be opened.zts4708e	Well, what do you mean?zts4709e	Don't know. Hahaha.zts4710e	A strange feeling.zts4711e	Ahhh. Here. It's for.zts4712e	Who?zts4713e	Kenko?? Hmm. Strange name. (Mumble)zts4714e	Do you know. him?zts4715e	Excuse me, do you know where I can get the necklace of Hell dog?zts4716e	The necklace of Hell dog?? Why, of course, Hell dog has it. (Grumbling)zts4717e	So, where do I have to go?zts4718e	Hell dog lives.zts4719e	Hmmm. It's such an unpleasant place.zts4720e	Ahh. it is.zts4721e	Are you an intruder?zts4722e	Haha. Human beings are not allowed to come here.zts4723e	Bring it on!!zts4724e	No. please wait.zts4725e	Even though I may look strict, I know about flexibility.zts4726e	What do you mean?zts4727e	It means with a bribe, I can keep silent.zts4728e	Hahaha.zts4729e	Let's like peace. Hahaha.zts4730e	Hmm.. This doesn't seem like a conversation Devils would have.zts4731e	Well. the Devil world is not that different from others. Corruption and decay are everywhere.zts4732e	Okay.. okay.. then, what do you want?zts4733e	Whiskers of blue mole.zts4734e	What? What is it?zts4735e	The most popular fashion accessory in the Devil world these days.zts4736e	Hmmm.Okay.zts4737e	Yes, and I will consider the deal was made, and hope you hurry up. I can't zip my mouth for ever, you know.zts4738e	Haha.. Good job!zts4739e	Just a moment!!zts4740e	I came here for Kenko. I chased him. Where is he now?zts4741e	Not here.zts4742e	He went back a long time ago. He said he just came here to get some antidote.zts4743e	Hmmm. That means that I am late.zts4744e	But if you want, I can tell you where he is.zts4745e	Do you know where he is?zts4746e	Of course.. Haha.zts4747e	Can you tell me right now?zts4748e	Of course, but not to empty hands! Haha!!zts4749e	(Mumble) Reminds me of someone in Milano.zts4750e	Kenel.zts4751e	Yes.. Master.zts4752e	Collect all the scattered soldiers and put them in order. It's war. War to punish our brother.zts4753e	Yes. Master!zts4754e	And human beings.zts4755e	We have to finish the story with you.zts4756e	The story ends with.zts4757e	cease-fire.zts4758e	Ahhh. It breaks my heart. Brothers.zts4759e	Get quest.zts4760e	Finish.zts4761e	Bet.zts4762e	Life is a gamble. Will you bet?zts4763e	Apply for job-change.zts4764e	Family-related.zts4765e	Get quest.zts4766e	Learning Skill.zts4771e	Individual arena.zts4772e	Family arena.zts4773e	Time Circle.zts4774e	Teleport.zts4775e	Decide place of respawn.zts4776e	( )zts4777e	For use of laboratory.zts4778e	Hmm. This is.zts4779e	Hmm. It's great. This is.zts4780e	Well. anyway, I think we can make something funny with this.zts4781e	God Zenas. It's the shadow of Zenas. Anyway, that shadow ruined. the lab.zts4782e	Anyway, just a moment. Ummm. Here it is. This is.zts4783e	This is the seal I mentioned. With this, you may meet. Shadow Zenas.zts4784e	According to this document. Hehe. well. even though I can't guarantee it.zts4785e	Ah, your weapon is just a wooden stick..zts4786e	Congratulations! Now you get your second pet [Happy Woolly].zts4787e	It looks like something is going to happen soon in this place.zts4788e	Hey, what are you doing there?zts4789e	Ah.. nothing special.. Just hanging around.zts4790e	Haha. I see. Then, will you do me a favor?zts4791e	Guard: Can you go to the tool shop and bring me the weapon I left for repair?zts4792e	Yes. Of course.zts4793e	Oh! You are the man! Okay, deal!zts4794e	Good news!! Koaren's troop retreated to Mt. Krem. The war is over!!zts4795e	(Sigh!!) Now, it ends with this.zts4796e	Ah?? You don't look so happy.zts4797e	Well. it just doesn't feel like it's over. Hahaha.zts4798e	Haha.. It's because you are too tired. By the way, even in the age of peace, NosCamp will be busy!!zts4799e	I guess you are going to give me a new mission!! Tell me.zts4800e	Raul asked you to collect some magic supplies. He looks busy, so hurry up. Also, Vellochika requested some cooking material. Help him too.zts4801e	Here, it is!zts4802e	Magic supplies. You requested it, right?zts4803e	Ah.. Really?zts4804e	Yes.. You did.zts4805e	Aha!! I've been waiting for it.zts4806e	Haha.zts4807e	And then, thanks for NosCamp people!!zts4808e	Haha.. Yes.zts4809e	By the way, how's the treasure hunt going?zts4810e	Yes? Treasure hunt?zts4811e	Yes.. I heard that NosCamp is busy in a treasure hunt, isn't it?zts4812e	Hmmm.. I will ask Eril about it.zts4813e	Ahhh!! You are left out!!zts4814e	Hahah. Not really I guess.zts4815e	Wow. In NosCamp, someone must be left out!!zts4816e	No.. No.. Calm down. That's not possible.zts4817e	Yes. Yes. You are surely left out!! Go and ask Eril!zts4818e	(Mumble) Vellochika looks happy!! Hopeless!!zts4819e	Hey. Eril. Eril.zts4820e	Yes?zts4821e	I heard from Vellochika about the treasure hunt. What is it?zts4822e	Ahhh. That is.zts4823e	Tell me!!zts4824e	Hmm.. To be honest with you, we received the report from someone about a hidden treasure.zts4825e	And then, why didn't you tell me about that?zts4826e	Hmmm. Because the source was Sam.zts4827e	Haha.. as you know, he is hardly a credible source.zts4828e	Yeah, he is.zts4829e	If you are personally interested, why don't you go meet him? But.zts4830e	Yes.. I know. NosCamp can't give any support on this.. You wanted to say this, right?zts4831e	Bingo!!zts4832e	Can you tell me about the hidden treasure?zts4833e	The hidden treasure.zts4834e	I heard about it from Eril. What is that?zts4835e	Hehe.. You idiot. There's nothing I can tell you about that!!zts4836e	What do you mean? Why not?zts4837e	Sam Treasure in the darkness.. Forbidden treasure.. Do you want it? And then, do you know the 4 virtues?zts4838e	4 Virtues?zts4839e	The first one is sympathy! You have to understand the feelings of others. You need to feel the pain and sorrow of others.zts4840e	The second one is sacrifice! For the good of others, you have to sacrifice yourself.zts4841e	Hmmm.zts4842e	The third one is service!! Not only by emotion, but also by action, you have to serve others.zts4843e	(Mumble) Hmmm. I feel it's getting worse.zts4844e	Last, but not the least, is sharing!! You have to share all of your belongings with others.zts4845e	Hmm. Well. Is it because you have something to ask of me?zts4846e	(Coughing)zts4847e	Your message is. If I do something for you, you will tell me about the treasure.. Did I get it right?zts4850e	It's in the Western mine area. inside the cave, there's a 'super tool set'.zts4851e	Super Tool set?zts4852e	It consists of 4 pieces. I need them.zts4853e	Okay.. I will bring them to you. And then, you will tell me about the treasure. Right?zts4854e	Hmm.. Hmmm.zts4855e	(Mumble) Yes.. It's Sam.. What else do I expect from him..zts4856e	Sam: Ohhh!!zts4857e	Now, here they are.zts4858e	Ohhhhh!!zts4859e	As promised, now tell me about the treasure!!zts4860e	Sure. I will keep my promise. I will put a mark on the location of the treasure!!zts4861e	What.. what the heck is this!!zts4862e	Well.zts4863e	Get it out of here!!zts4864e	Sorry.zts4865e	(Sam got only the shame)zts4866e	Hahaha. The treasure of Sam was. that carved sculpture?zts4867e	Yes.. it was.zts4868e	This stone seems interesting. Can I have a look at it?zts4869e	Here it is.zts4870e	Hmm. This is.zts4871e	Anything. special?zts4872e	This is.. a magic stone. The Kovolts in Kreano use this.zts4873e	The Kovolts in Kreano? You mean Kenko??zts4874e	Hmm.. Yes. Also, this stone seems to have been used recently. It means that the Kenkos are still somewhere in Milano.zts4875e	That means Kenko didn't go back to Kreano.zts4876e	Now there are many rumors about the war between Koaren and Kenko. We have to inspect it clearly, since it will have an impact on Milano too. It may even cause a big problem later.zts4877e	. As I've been concerned.zts4878e	You seem to have expected this.zts4879e	Yes.. Hmmm.. I will meet Koaren again!!zts4880e	Hmmm.. I heard from the other adventurers that you can meet Koaren spies in Fernon temple. You'd better go there.zts4881e	Who is it!!zts4882e	Ahhh. Calm down. I am just.zts4883e	If you don't intend to fight, give way for me.zts4884e	Just a moment. It's just because I am concerned about KrrKoaren.zts4885e	Ha! How dare you name my master! Get out of here. I don't want to listen to this.zts4886e	Hold on! I know that you are against Kenko. I am just trying to.zts4887e	Hey. I lost my companion to Kenko and don't know if he is alive or not. Do you still think I want to listen to you? Get out of my face now!!zts4888e	(Mumble) It's useless to say more.. By the way, did he lose a companion?zts4889e	Why do you help us?zts4890e	It's funny!!zts4891e	I.. I don't want to be your enemy!zts4892e	I just want to help you.zts4893e	(Sigh) Master and Sir Kenel has ordered me not to hurt you.zts4894e	Well.. do whatever you want.zts4895e	Tha.. Thanks.zts4896e	You want to help us? If so, there's one place we suspect. Can you inspect that place?zts4897e	Definitely!!zts4898e	Some companions went there and there has been no news from them since. So, help us find out what happened to them.zts4899e	In there? Nothing, other than the Koaren companions that were there.zts4900e	Hmmm.. I see. That's good.zts4901e	But, I got attacked all of a sudden.zts4902e	Hey!! Please understand. We Kovolts hate humans and as you know, the war has just ended.zts4903e	Yes.. I will.zts4904e	Kenko's supply troop has arrived near the Fernon temple. I came to know this when you were not here.zts4905e	I am wondering what supplies the troops gave to Kenko. We have to investigate this.zts4906e	I will check it out!!zts4907e	Hmm. You don't need to, because it's very dangerous and it's our business to do that.zts4908e	Now, Koaren has become the enemy of Kenko. So, it's safer for human beings to approach there than Koaren.zts4909e	Haha.. You are stubborn!!zts4910e	Because I can make it!!zts4911e	Are you serious?zts4912e	Yes. definitely!!zts4913e	Sorry. I know someone has to do it, but we cannot make it.zts4914e	Don't be sorry, just leave it to me!!zts4915e	Okay, sure, I will. First of all, they drink a suspicious beverage. It will be great if we can have some of it.zts4916e	Hmmm.. It's great.. Good job!!zts4917e	Haha. Thanks for the compliment.zts4918e	I will analyze this and tell you the result. By the way.zts4919e	Kenkos brought some emergency rations. Can we have some of them too?zts4920e	Just leave to me!!zts4921e	You are so quick!!zts4922e	Haha.. I told you I could make it, by the way, did any result come out of the analysis?zts4923e	Hmm. It looks like some sort of hallucinating material. But not exactly.zts4924e	It has some effect, but it's so weak that it doesn't have any impact on our body.zts4925e	It sounds complicated.zts4926e	Well.. If we inspect this gum, it might throw some light on this.zts4927e	And the powder they use on the wounded soldiers.. It looks suspicious too.zts4928e	Why?zts4929e	Rumor has it that the powder heals immediately and perfectly, no matter how serious the wound is.zts4930e	I will bring you some.zts4931e	Sorry again. I am giving you such difficult tasks.zts4932e	This is the medicine.zts4933e	The gum.. If you chew it with the beverage, it turns out to be a 'mad'cine.zts4934e	What? 'mad'cine? I only know medicines.zts4935e	It drives people to the brink of sanity and changes them into belligerent monsters.zts4936e	Oh. Gosh.zts4937e	This powder may have similar effects.zts4938e	Will you wait? This powder will be analyzed immediately!!zts4939e	(Spy left with the powder. after several minutes.)zts4940e	It.. It's a big problem!!zts4941e	Whoever takes this will become a monster with super powers.zts4942e	Then, he will die soon!!zts4943e	So scary, isn't it?zts4944e	However, what's worse is that Kung's troops are chasing Kenko's retreated troops. Most of the retreated are wounded, so he chased them.zts4945e	Kung's in danger.. What do we do?zts4946e	Wait. Wait for a moment!zts4947e	I want to go together.zts4948e	Not possible.zts4949e	Impossible? Why not? Do you have a reason?zts4950e	The place we are heading to. This place is is full of hatred for human beings. You can't even step on it.zts4951e	It.. It is.zts4952e	We are not human beings, and can be accepted there, but that's not possible in your case. Sorry. Bye.zts4953e	(Kung disappeared)zts4954e	Hmm. Is there any solution that can help? Ah. Raul may have it.zts4955e	Hey. Raul!zts4956e	Raul!zts4957e	Umm.zts4958e	Raul!! Listen to me!!zts4959e	Ah. Sorry.zts4960e	It's an emergency. Do you know the place that humans cannot enter?zts4961e	Ah. Yes. But I don't know the reason. It says that the ghosts there hate human beings and don't allow them in.. except for.zts4962e	Except?zts4963e	Ah. If you are not human beings, you can enter.zts4964e	Hey. that sounds ridiculous!zts4965e	Ah. Yes. You are right.zts4966e	Then, it's not possible at all?zts4967e	Ah.zts4968e	Please!!zts4969e	I can make you look like a Kovolt for the time being.zts4970e	Sam Main Questzts4971e	Lv.19 New friendzts4972e	Eril Main Questzts4973e	Lv.25 Formidable enemyzts4974e	Lv.31 Gray stormzts4975e	Morgan Main Questzts4976e	Lv.28 Rival competitionzts4977e	Raymond Main Questzts4978e	Lv.33 Tornado of Warzts4979e	Lv.39 Trust and Betrayalzts4980e	Baymen Main Questzts4981e	Lv.35 my side and the other.zts4982e	But if you have 10,000 Gold, it will be changed.zts4983e	10,000 Gold?zts4984e	Hahahaha. 10,000 Gold. It's 10,000 Gold!zts4985e	Hahaha. 10,000 Gold. 10,000 Gold!zts4986e	Haha. 10,000 Gold!zts4987e	First, the down payment is 50,000 Gold.zts4988e	Now 30,000 Gold for Sir Crescendo is ready. And.zts4989e	And.. where is the remaining 20,000??zts4990e	Hmmm. Really?zts4991e	Hmm. If we use this sucking-funnel. we can get the energy of the Kovolts. Hmmm.zts4992e	How?zts4993e	Once the Kovolts are tired we can use this.zts4994e	And then?zts4995e	That funnel. if it's filled up with energy. that is.. (Mumble)zts4996e	Tell me more details.zts4997e	Hmm.. Let's talk about it after filling the Kovolts up with energy.zts4998e	(Sigh!) Now, is it done?zts4999e	(Voice) Ex. Excuse me. Anyone here?zts5000e	This.. This is Raul?zts5001e	(Voice) Haha.. yes.. It's me.. Raul.zts5002e	How did you come here.. It's dangerous!!zts5003e	(Voice) Ahh. I.. I invented. something. It's.zts5004e	(Voice) The gadget that sends voice to a person long distance.zts5005e	You mean a gadget that passes voice to a person over long distances?zts5006e	(Voice) Ahh. Yes. That's. it.zts5007e	Ah.. it's so great.. Anyway, I filled up that funnel and got the mirage marble. I will go back now.zts5008e	(Voice) Ahh. but. do you know the deserted tower of the wizard?zts5009e	What are you talking about?zts5010e	(Voice) Sorry. But that name I can't remember. Is it a scroll?zts5011e	(Voice) We need. that scroll. Uhhh!zts5012e	(Noisy)zts5013e	His message was disconnected.zts5014e	His new invention must be out of order. Anyway, did he say.. the deserted tower of the wizard?zts5015e	Raul! Yes, it is.zts5016e	(Mumble) ..zts5017e	Raul!!zts5018e	Ahhh. So sorry. This gadget is broken now. So.zts5019e	(Mumble) He's still fixing it.zts5020e	By the way.. what brought you here?zts5021e	I brought what you asked.zts5022e	Ah. What is this?zts5023e	Ah. Yes. I did. Sorry. This is. Yes. It's enough. Wait.zts5024e	(After some time)zts5025e	Here it is.zts5026e	Will I look like a Kovolt with this?zts5027e	Yes. I guess so.zts5028e	(Mumble) I will ignore him.zts5029e	Is it you, human?zts5030e	It's war now. I will show Kenko what happens to those who betray us.zts5031e	But.. why did Kenko betray you?zts5032e	Haha.. I don't know, but I will get to know it a little later. Don't worry about it now. Just think about the WAR!!zts5033e	Yes.zts5034e	Our troops will attack the main troops of Kenko. You!! Stay here and block their retreat!zts5035e	Yes.. I will.zts5036e	Once the retreat is blocked, dispatch our spies. They will bring troops in the rear for support.zts5037e	Yes.. I will. Don't worry about it.zts5038e	Thanks human. and take care!!zts5039e	(Explaining what happened so far.)zts5040e	I see, we should also move now. Did the main troops leave for Kenko already?zts5041e	Probably.. I think so.zts5042e	Here's the critical information. I know where the Kenkos are now. What if we hit them before the war begins.zts5043e	Can we finish the war quickly?zts5044e	Yes. Of course.zts5045e	Let me go. Give me the location.zts5046e	Need to inform the Kovolts immediately. I don't have much time, must hurry!!zts5047e	Was Kenel captured? Oh my!zts5048e	What do we have to do?zts5049e	I don't know what to do. Shoot!zts5050e	Sorry.. It's of no use to be angry with you.zts5051e	Look at this. It is the document that I found in Kenko's camp.zts5052e	Hmmm. This is an ancient language of Kreano. Maybe Kung knows how to read it.zts5053e	Where is Kung?zts5054e	Around here somewhere. If I meet Kung beforehand, I will tell him your story.zts5055e	Yes. Please.zts5056e	Hurry up and find Kung!!zts5057e	Where do we have to go now?zts5058e	East.. It's around here.. It's called the 'Corridor of Whirl'.zts5059e	Corridor of Whirl?zts5060e	I don't know any more than this. The place is under a veil. The only sure thing is that it's very very dangerous to go in there.zts5061e	Then, I better be ready for it.zts5062e	It's strange. I can't go forward. This mysterious magic power. Hmm. Raul may know about this.zts5063e	(Explaining what has happened so far.)zts5064e	Ahh. Sorry. Do you know the Holy-red branch?zts5065e	Holy-red branch? What is that?zts5066e	The branch of innocence, made using the holy red branch at the holy altar.zts5067e	Branch of innocence?zts5068e	The holy altar is.. hmm.. in the 8th floor of the deserted tower of the wizard. (Mumble) ..zts5069e	Hey.. hey!!zts5070e	So, you mean if I have the branch of innocence, I can pass the corridor.. right?zts5071e	(Mumble) .. I guess it's right.zts5072e	Now, I have to go to the deserted 'Tower of the wizard'.zts5073e	Wow.. I made it.. This is the branch of innocence.zts5074e	There are 4 energy streams. But these streams are protected by the power of the different elements.zts5075e	Then how do I neutralize that?zts5076e	Hmm. you probably have to use the magic supplies with all the elements. Let's search around here for a bit. We may find some answers.zts5077e	All the steams have been neutralized!!zts5078e	Hurry!! You have to complete it before Fernon regains its power!!zts5079e	(Voice) Stop it!!zts5080e	Who.. Who is it??zts5081e	(Voice) Do you wish to confront Fernon?zts5082e	Who is it?zts5083e	(Voice) The Frenzy of Fernon will burn you down to the ashes!!zts5084e	Who is it? What do you want from me?zts5085e	(Voice) Let's make a deal. I will wait for you at the top of the temple.zts5086e	(Silence)zts5087e	That voice. can we trust it?zts5088e	Look in front!zts5089e	It's aura contains vast power. It comes from within the voice. We can't choose to ignore it with ease.zts5090e	Well.. For starters I have no idea who you are and what you want. Why did you call us?zts5091e	Kill. Kill me!zts5092e	Be careful. That's enormous magic power!!zts5093e	Woah!! I am free.zts5094e	I.. I don't know. Ever since I was captured and put here, my time seems to have stopped. I don't know who I am or where I lived.. I don't remember anything at all.zts5095e	What. What do you mean? We have to defeat Fernon!!zts5096e	Hahaha.. It can never be defeated.zts5097e	Yes. I probably am the key to put Fernon to sleep. Someone has to awaken Fernon.zts5098e	Yes.zts5099e	Thank you. I am free now finally. I can leave now.zts5100e	(The soul is slowly disappearing.)zts5101e	Hey.. Hey.. We have to beat Fernon. How can we reach the trunk of Fernon?zts5102e	Fernon will allow only the person that awakens it or you need the symbol of that person. Without that, only death awaits. Give up!!zts5103e	Hey. Hey.zts5104e	(The soul disappeared..)zts5105e	Ahh. Oh my.zts5106e	It was Kenko that awoke Fernon.zts5107e	What do you mean?zts5108e	I mean that if we have the goods of Kenko, we can break that magic field.zts5109e	But where can we get those.zts5110e	Yes, That is the problem.zts5111e	Hmm. You don't know where those goods are. Do you?zts5112e	Now!! We have to go back to Milano.. To NosCamp.. Hurry up!!zts5113e	Time's running out. Hurry up!!zts5114e	Sellbig!! Sellbig!!zts5115e	Ahh.. Why are you in such a hurry?zts5116e	That magic stone.. I gave it to you before!!zts5117e	That magic stone in Kreano.. That carved stone!!zts5118e	Ahh.. Yes.. it is here..zts5119e	Ahhh. I don't know what you are talking about. However, I will be happy if it will help you.zts5120e	Yes. This is. With this.zts5121e	It's over now.zts5122e	No, not yet. At least not as long as we live. We have to keep moving if we want to stay that way.zts5123e	Is there any hope then?zts5124e	The magic field looks like it has broken down completely. We can rush to the heart of Fernon directly.zts5125e	The heart of Fernon?zts5126e	Yes.. If we can stop its heart beat, the body will be lifeless.zts5127e	Right. We should have targeted its heart.zts5128e	We have to believe that we can make it. It's too early to give up.zts5129e	We won't run away!! We won't be defeated!! My brothers! Follow me!! Lift your swords high and slay these human beings.zts5130e	This black slate!! It was for communication amongst the Devils.zts5131e	Buh.. by the way.. why did you tell me the story??zts5135e	Hmm. Hmmm. It's. known as. Rocking-rolling cliff.zts5136e	Rocking-rolling cliff?zts5137e	Be careful! Why did you follow me?zts5138e	What is dangerous?zts5139e	Don't go forward any more. There's a formidable devil ahead!zts5140e	Devil?zts5141e	It attacks all living creatures other than Kovolts. The Demons brought it here.zts5142e	Don't go forward. Bye.zts5143e	Milano Skill Registration Office (Use)zts5151e	Get the seal of the Chicken-king.zts5152e	We are announcing to all the people of Milano.zts5153e	The Chicken farm of Sir Lopello is in danger because of the furious and violent chickens & roosters.zts5154e	The Chicken-king used to be very popular and famous.

Where is it?zts5188e	Can you see that dug up place? That's where it fell. But you need to break this to get to it.zts5189e	Hmmm.. Only if I could break it?(I need something harder) . Hold on!! I got an idea.zts5190e	You still want to help me?zts5191e	Of course, What is it?zts5192e	I need to get the broken Meteorite Chunks, but my pickaxe is not helping me one bit.zts5193e	I need a big hammer to do the job.

I'll also help you with this.zts5206e	Yes, Let's get them away immediatelyzts5207e	Hewwww..zts5208e	Wow.. you are so energetic. Thanks for your help.zts5209e	No. You worked harder than me. Now, I will go to check that stonezts5210e	Yes, It's over there, and looks like a tombstone. By the way, I feel something weird here, so be careful.zts5211e	..?zts5212e	* Out of breath * Hew. they are not supposed to be strong this much. Something is strange.zts5213e	Is it because of the stone? I need to investigate this immediately!zts5214e	Finally, I can see the stone. Wow.. It looks like a tombstone!!zts5215e	Ahh~ I don't know. But I feel so dizzy.zts5216e	When I touch the stone, a picture appears and displays something.zts5217e	Where am I? And who are they?zts5218e	That ugly man must be a villain. Is he kidnapping that lady? Is the guy in red costume trying to rescue her from him?zts5219e	They call each their names.. The villain is Namaju and the lady is Jajamaru. Ah.. She is Princess Sakura.zts5220e	Those two men.. They look very strong.. Uh? He's running away from there once the gate appeared.zts5221e	The gate came out from the stone. Uh?? That gravestone is. It has the same shape as the stone.zts5222e	I need to investigate the stone more.zts5223e	what is this? Looks like a pebble. But the shape is weird.zts5224e	Ah.. As soon as I picked the pebble, the picture disappeared.zts5225e	This is no simple picture on a pebble?zts5226e	This pebble must be a key to reach them.zts5227e	This pebble matches the hole of this stone exactly.zts5228e	I must remember this place.zts5229e	Explained it to Eril.zts5230e	People in the card? No way, it's not possiblezts5231e	So, Any clues about this?zts5232e	Hmm.. I don't think I am of use. Ask to Mr. Sellbig. He may help you.zts5233e	Ok.. I will..zts5234e	Explained it to Sellbigzts5235e	Hmmm.zts5236e	Do you know what it is?zts5237e	Yes, I've heard about that card, but it's not easy to bring the people out..zts5238e	If you know how to, please tell me. I will try by best.zts5239e	It may be possible to bring them out for short time.zts5240e	Really?zts5241e	Yes, but for this we need an item called 'the core of spirit', Mr. Raul may know about it.zts5242e	Yes, I see. Thanks.zts5243e	Raul, Raul, Where are you??zts5244e	I am here, What brought you here?zts5245e	I need.. I need the core of spirit. Where can I get it?zts5246e	Hey.. Calm.. Calm down. If you need one, I can make it for you.zts5247e	Really? Wow. I am so fortunate. Would you make it right now?zts5248e	Well. It's not difficult to make it. However. the material. It's not easy to get it.zts5249e	I will get it by all means. Please tell me what we need.zts5250e	Hmm. To be honest with you, we need pure water and fairy's dung. Pure water is easy to get, but you must be a close friend to a fairy to get his dungzts5251e	And then? Vellochika.. Yes. She's very close to fairies.zts5252e	Yes. Raul. I will be back very soon. It's urgent, so please start preparation.zts5253e	Oh.. yes!!zts5254e	Vellochika!!zts5255e	Hey~ Don't make the fuss. Be quite, otherwise you may surprise fairies.zts5256e	So.. sorry..

And can I have some, please?zts5261e	<pname>, as you know, fairy is enthusiastic about the food, so if you bring them good dishes, they will give you some.zts5262e	But, spice for making good food is not enough. Can you give me 5 leaves of fragrance then?zts5263e	Ah.. That's a piece of cake.zts5264e	Here they are.zts5265e	Wow.. with this, we can have great lunch with fairies. Just moment.zts5266e	Here it is. The dung of fairyzts5267e	Thanks!!zts5268e	You're most welcome. Due to your awesome dishes, we had great lunch.zts5269e	(Now, all material are ready)zts5270e	Finally, you come. I've awaiting you.zts5271e	It's urgent. Please make it immediately.zts5272e	Wait.. Just a moment.zts5273e	Ok.. Ok.. here it is.zts5274e	Ah. Thanks so much. And sorry for this hasty order.zts5275e	No.. not at all. I am also pleased to help you.zts5276e	(With this, I can bring out Jajamaru!! Let's go to Mr. Sellbig)zts5277e	Mr. Sellbig. I brought the core of spirit. Now, what do I have to do?zts5278e	It's very simple. Pour it on the cardzts5279e	Like this?zts5280e	Yes. Slowly.. But keep in mind that you can bring them out for short time only. Time is not enough.zts5281e	Slowly, the smoke is coming out of the card.zts5282e	Hew~ Where am I? Thanks first of all. You must know what happened, right? Because we don't have enough time, please help me immediately.zts5283e	Yes, with my pleasure!!zts5284e	Thanks. I didn't expect to have a friend like you in this world. It's so great.zts5285e	Me neither.zts5286e	By the way, did you find any gate around there? I can feel same strong energy over there as I felt in my home village.zts5287e	I heard that new gate was found in Northern prairie.zts5288e	I see. Through that gate, I can go back to my home village. I hid princess's hair pin there. Can you seek for it?zts5289e	Hair pin? Is it important one?zts5290e	Yes, it has the power of princess inside. I could come here due to its power.zts5291e	Ah..zts5292e	And Namaju can be destroyed by my power onlyzts5293e	Even if my body and power is sealed into the card, can you use my power? I will give all my power to you.zts5294e	Please, use my power and rescue the princess.zts5295e	Yes.. I will. I will rescue her by all means.zts5296e	You have to train yourself to get used to this power.zts5297e	Jajamaru became sealed into the card again.zts5298e	Don't worry Jajamaru. I will rescue Princess Sakura by all means. With your power.zts5299e	Hey, you.. Just moment.zts5300e	Yes?zts5301e	I can feel very pure power from you, <pname>.zts5302e	Hahaha.. Don't say that. I am very shy.zts5303e	Ah.. not from you, but from something else that you have now.zts5304e	..zts5305e	Ah. that hair pin. Can I have a look at it?zts5306e	Sure, you can.zts5307e	Wow. The power is so clean and pure. Hmmm. But the owner of this power. Is she locked in somewhere?zts5308e	Yes, she is, how do you know that?zts5309e	When I feel the power, I can feel where the owner is.zts5310e	And then, can you release her with your power?zts5311e	If the pin is full of her energy, it may be possible, but unfortunately, the energy in this pin is not enough.zts5312e	Gee. And then, there's no way to set her free?zts5313e	I know the way, but forget it. It's not possible.zts5314e	No, I will try any means possible. Please tell mezts5315e	Anything? Hmm. do you know the tower of wizard?zts5316e	The tower of wizard? Do you mean the deserted tower?zts5317e	Yes, the tower is filled up with the devils created by black magician.zts5318e	And what do I have to do there?zts5319e	To create devils, black magicians used the crystal of souls. If you kill the devils, you can get that crystal, but they are too strong..zts5320e	Crystal of Soul. I will bring them.zts5321e	We have to make a gem out of the crystal. So, bring the crystal as many as possible.zts5322e	* Out of breath * Is.. Is it enough to make the gem?zts5323e	You are so passionate and desperate. I guess the person in lock-in is very important to you.zts5324e	Yes, also my precious friend asked me to rescue her. I need to protect her.zts5325e	I see. I will help you keep the promise. Just moment.zts5326e	I made the gem, If you put this into the hair pin, it will be full of the energy soon.zts5327e	Ah. Yes. please do it.zts5328e	Ok.. and then, I will do it right now. Be careful.zts5329e	..?zts5330e	When the gem is put inside the pin, tremendous energy comes together and puts into the pin.zts5331e	Wow.. this energy is hugezts5332e	Now, it's completed.zts5333e	Where is Princess Sakura? Isn't she supposed to come out now?zts5334e	Ah.. Is her name Sakura? Call her name, and the response will come out.zts5335e	Yes I see. Thanks.. I really appreciate your help.zts5336e	Break the seal of Princess Sakurazts5337e	Receive Jajamaru Questzts5338e	Hmm. If it's only for short time, we can get him out of card.zts5339e	Even if I said with confidence, but. Namaju. He looks very powerful.zts5340e	<pname>!! Why do you hesitate? Jajamaru is with you!zts5341e	Jajamaru, Keep watching me. I will keep the promise by all means!zts5342e	<pname>! Just momentzts5343e	I can feel very pure power from you, <pname>.zts5344e	Jajamaru TimeSpacezts5345e	Hew. I was so surprised. I didn't expect to come here. Ah! You! You are Namaju!!zts5346e	Hek!! Who are you? How do you know my name?zts5347e	Hey.. You there.. I am caught by him. Help me out!!zts5348e	(Now they can see me. By the way, where is Jajamaru, Can't he follow me?)zts5349e	(It's not a good idea to fight against him, if I don't know about his power) Ok, I will step back this time, anyone in my way will be hurt.zts5350e	Hey. Wait. He ran away already. He is so quick as assassin.zts5351e	Is it. a pebble? He dropped it on purpose? But it's shape and mark look familiar.zts5352e	I got it, Namaju!!zts5353e	Ah!! You came here to rescue me?zts5354e	Hey.. I warned you not be in my way. Hey, kill him!zts5355e	Hew~ They were so strong.. By the way I spent so much time. I need to hurry to chase him.zts5356e	Where is he on earth? By the way, this sound is weird. Some one is fighting with swords. Who are they?zts5357e	Is he.. Jajamaru? (He couldn't come through even gate, and how could he come here?) Anyway, time's getting short. Let's help him.zts5358e	I don't know who you are, but want to thank you for help.zts5359e	You're welcome. It's my pleasure.zts5360e	I will not forget your help. See you.zts5361e	Hey. Just moment. Let's go together!zts5362e	Namaju, Finally we met.zts5363e	What! Jajamaru. What brought you here?zts5364e	Jajamaru.. What are you doing now? Release me now!!zts5365e	I will help you, Jajamaru.zts5366e	You are?? Yes, but I don't know if your attack will have an effect to him.zts5367e	(What!! Oh.. my..!! My attack does not have any power to him)zts5368e	Namaju has special power, so except for me, nobody can attack him. Please protect her.zts5369e	* Scream *zts5370e	Haha.. Namaju, Can see you this?zts5371e	Uhhh. Jajamaru. I won't surrenderzts5372e	(Well, I feel pleased because the fight was settle down, even if I couldn't help him)zts5373e	Now, it's time to put the period on our endless fight. Take this!!zts5374e	But, at that moment, Namaju took out something. It's a card, and suddenly Jajamaru was soaked into the card.zts5375e	What did you do to Jajamaru?zts5376e	I sealed him again. Haha. Stupid idiot he is.. Puhahaha!!zts5377e	(I can not fight against him alone. I need to run away now, but will come back again to rescue her!!)zts5378e	Princess Sakura.. I will be back soon, so be patient and wait for me!!zts5379e	Yes, I forgot you were here. Catch him!! Haha.. It's so nice day today, Puhaha!!zts5380e	Hey, You will be sorry for this!!zts5381e	Hek!! Did he bring the card? Anyway, Jajamaru was already sealed in it, so what can he do with the card? Hahaha!!zts5382e	Ahh! I was about to fall down. Gate was just above the roof. Hair pin. Where is it?zts5383e	Gee. Those villains came here already. I need to get the pin before they find it.zts5384e	Gosh. They saw me.zts5385e	* Out of breath * These are too many.. By the way I feel, the more I fight the stronger I become. Does this power come from Jajamaru?zts5386e	I found it!zts5387e	Haha.. You made a good job. It was worth following you.zts5388e	What?? Who.. Who are you?zts5389e	Don't think so much. (It's strange. How do I feel the power of Jajamaru from this guy?) Give me the pin. Master Namaju wants it.zts5390e	No way, It belongs to Jajamaru. I will not give it to you.zts5391e	Do you know Jajamaru?zts5392e	Yes, of course. He's a friend of mine.zts5393e	Hmm.. if that is true then I can not let you go back alive. Sorry about this.zts5394e	Uhhh. It's the power of Jajamaru. It's real. And then, I can not defeat him.zts5395e	* Out of breath * Jajamaru is with me!!zts5396e	Uhhh. And then, I will admit this. Kill me.zts5397e	I don't need your life!zts5398e	* Coughing* Who are these guys?zts5399e	Master Namaju wants you. Don't try to run away. We will await you.zts5400e	Haha.. I am not running away. Namaju, Wait for me!!zts5401e	NOS Event!zts5402e	nos event Raul 1zts5403e	nos event Raul 2zts5404e	nos event Raul 3zts5405e	nos event Raul 4zts5406e	nos event Raul 5zts5407e	nos event Raul 6zts5408e	nos event Raul 7zts5409e	nos event Raul 8zts5410e	Milano NosCamp (For Japan)zts5411e	Milano Alchemy Association (For Japan)zts5412e	As you may see, I couldn't protect even my master.zts5413e	Can you use my power. Even if it is sealed into this card.zts5414e	I will give all my power to you. Use this and rescue the Princess.zts5415e	Well. it is.zts5416e	Namaju can be destroyed only by my power.zts5417e	I see. Leave it to me!!zts5418e	And take this. You may find it useful in the future.zts5419e	This is. Hair pin?zts5420e	Yes. It has the energy of the princess. I could come here thanks to that hair pin.zts5421e	Now, how can I find Namaju.zts5422e	I heard that new gate was found nearby. Considering it came when the meteorite came, it may have a clue.zts5423e	Ah. That gate. That's why I could feel the same energy as I felt in my home village.zts5424e	Ok! And then, I will rescue Princess Sakura with you.zts5425e	Thanks. I didn't expect to have a friend like you in this world. Now, I am so happy to have you, so please.zts5426e	And Jajamaru became sealed into the card again.zts5427e	Me too, I am so glad to be friend to you. Don't worry, I will keep our promise. Jajamaru.zts5428e	Deleted quest dialoguezts5429e	Jajamaru tombstone questzts5430e	Where am I now? Where do these bamboo trees come from?zts5431e	You?? Namaju?zts5432e	Hek!! Who are you? And how do you know my master?zts5433e	(Is it Namaju's avatar? Hmm. It can be. It looks a bit small. By the way, where is Jajamaru?)zts5434e	(It may be dangerous to fight now, because I can not use all of master's power) .. I will give you the way now, but you will be sorry if you are in my way.zts5435e	Will you continue to interrupt me? And then, I will not forgive you!!zts5436e	The power of avatar is this much strong..zts5437e	Hew~ I am too tired to chase him more. I will give it up.zts5438e	Jajamaru_shining stonezts5439e	Master Namaju ordered to block him.zts5440e	I spent too much on these guys. I need to hurry to chase him.zts5441e	Hew. Is it over finally?zts5442e	What is this sound? It sounds as if some are fighting with swords. I will check it out.zts5443e	You are? Even if you are just an avatar, Namaju has special power. Please protect the princess.zts5444e	It's almost. Jajamaru! If I could use all power of master's.zts5445e	(I couldn't help a lot, but if I could rescue Sakura, it can not be better)zts5446e	You dared to insult the princess, and can not be forgiven. Here is my sword!zts5447e	But, at that moment, Namaju took out something. It's a card, and suddenly Jajamaru was soaked into the card.zts5448e	From the beginning, the princess was a bait. Now, nobody can be in my way. Hahaha.zts5449e	(I need to admit that I by myself can not beat Namaju. If only I can rescue Jajamaru.)zts5450e	(I feel so sorry to Princess Sakura, but I have to run away with the card.)zts5451e	Heh~ I forgot you are here. Now, are you running away, big loser? Hehehe~zts5452e	Hek!! Did he bring the card? Anyway, Jajamaru was already sealed in it, so what can he do with the card? Hahaha!!zts5453e	Nobody chasing me, now I am relieved. I will go back to Noscamp for helpzts5454e	Jajamaru_Seal of Raidzts5455e	Do you know where did you step in?zts5456e	I came here to punish Namaju!!zts5457e	Hahaha!! How dare you are!! Ok, if you pass through my test, I will let you see master Namaju. Haha!!zts5458e	Haha. You are not bad. OK, and then let's see how to handle my attack. Here I go!zts5459e	Huk! You are strong. Finally, will Namaju's day be numbered? Hahaha. Ok, you can go!zts5460e	You.. Aren't You the right hand of Namaju?zts5461e	You don't have to know it. Just go because you deserve it.zts5462e	Namaju! It won't be easy in this time!! Haha..zts5463e	Hmmm. Did he want me to beat himself? He looks so happy.zts5464e	Dialoguezts5465e	Big Tombstonezts5466e	What does it say?zts5467e	Small Tombstonezts5468e	Well. I don't knowzts5469e	ACT 2 Quest _ Branch of Mt. Kremzts5470e	Glad to meet you. I heard that you have the soul of Kovolts in human body.zts5471e	(Well.. I feel shy to hear about that)zts5472e	We need to build Noscamp in Mt, Krem but the village chief does not agree on it So, handle this problem.zts5473e	(Wait!! Now people just come to request me to do something, instead of asking!)zts5474e	Hey, Just a moment!zts5475e	What? You, soul of Kovolts.zts5476e	Haha.. It's enough, but at least you have to tell me what has been going on therezts5477e	Sure, KuruKoaren is helping its army, because they are tired and hungry. But because it has many enemies in everywhere, he needs a helping hand. Now, he decided to get the support from the adventurer like you and wants to build Noscamp here. But, it needs the consensus of village, and village people and chief have to agree on this. They still don't trust human beings, so we need a people like you, who has the soul of Kovolts, and..zts5478e	(It's enough!!) Ok. I understand. I will meet the village chief then.zts5479e	Dialogue was overzts5480e	How are you, chief?zts5481e	Yes, I am fine, and I heard about you from KuruKoaren. If you came here for Noscamp, don't waste your time any more.zts5482e	However. Sir.zts5483e	Of course I know that this is a good idea, but most of village people don't trust human beings.zts5484e	And then, is there anything I can help with?zts5485e	Why do you want to help us?zts5486e	Well.. It's because of Lopello, men and Kovolts started fighting and even war was caused by Demon. So, when we knew it, we worked together against..zts5487e	Do you think human beings really fought for Kovolts? Or don't you ever think they did because their lives were at risk. Well. It's enough. I can not tell you further. What about this? There's one mission you can show your heart to us. Will you challenge this?zts5488e	Yes, Definitely.. I will.zts5489e	Ok, and then, I will give you the chance. Collin come inside!!zts5490e	(One kovolt with wrapping his eyes came inside)zts5491e	Hmm. Now some evil power came into Mt.Krem and is taking away the energy of Kovolts. You!zts5492e	Yes, magician.zts5493e	Shinbone valley is the sacred place that even we Kovolts hardly step cross it. Yo go there and persuade our 8 ancestor gods to believe that this energy did not come from human society. And wash them with the pure juice of fruits and have their power to get rid of this evil energy.zts5494e	Wow~zts5495e	Huk! Statues talks. Are you an ancestor god?zts5496e	But I don't know what he says. Anyway, l will wash him with the juice!zts5497e	Oh~ Oooh~zts5498e	Woo~Woo~zts5499e	Woo~ Ohhh~zts5500e	Well, now it sounds like a song.zts5501e	Woo~ Ohh~ Woo~zts5502e	Uhh~ Woo~zts5503e	Ye~ Woo~ What?? What am I doing!!zts5504e	Oh~ Woouhhh~zts5505e	(Status was broken)zts5506e	Uhhh!! What happened here?zts5507e	Magician, the 8th status remains broken!zts5508e	Hmmm.. Was the dust in which color? Was it white or yellow?zts5509e	Mostly it was white.zts5510e	That statue was made by special and rare clay, and it's very hard to get that clay. Now, even if someone broke the statue, we don't have enough hands to fix it, and need to depend on human being for repair.zts5511e	Did you collect all you want? And then, I will leave to investigate other place.zts5512e	Yes, take care of you.zts5513e	(Kenel disappeared)zts5514e	Hew. It's very heavy. By the way, what is Catsy? Ah. And who do I have to ask to fix the statue? I don't know who has the talent for this. Do I ask to Smith first, because his job looks similar? Hmm. However, it's not the weapon, but the artist's work, so Is it Sam?zts5515e	Do you have any clue that who can fix a statue?zts5516e	No, I don't have any idea, and also don't want to know about it. I don't like the people who transform the earth and twist it for their own preference in the name of art.zts5517e	Well. You know it, but only don't want to tell me, do you?zts5518e	Pish!!zts5519e	Will you just tell me where he is then?zts5520e	Hump. By the way, what do you carry now?zts5521e	Ah. this is.zts5522e	(Take some clay)zts5523e	Wow!! What are you going to do with this?zts5524e	With this, I will make a statue in shinbone valleyzts5525e	I know well about the statues there. Are these all clay?zts5526e	Yes.. Is it enough?zts5527e	Well.. I guess so.. Probably more than enough to make them. Do you want me to meet a sculptor?zts5528e	Would you?zts5529e	Sure.. With my pleasure. Give me some clay.zts5530e	(Passing the clay)zts5531e	Wait. I will be back soon.zts5532e	(Sam went to somewhere and came back)zts5533e	Here it is..zts5534e	Yes.zts5535e	Now, is it completed?zts5536e	I built the status, magician.zts5537e	Good job you did. Now, village people got to trust human beings, and the chief allowed to build Noscamp.zts5538e	You don't have to thank to you. It's the plan of our ancestors.zts5539e	(Reported it to Sandra)zts5540e	Really? You did a fantastic job!!zts5541e	Haha.. thanks for your compliment.zts5542e	Now, I will give you a gift. Take this.zts5543e	Thanks. But it's just small.zts5544e	Small?? I thought you want to be a brave adventurer, not mercenary. Don't you?zts5545e	Yes. But.zts5546e	it's not the reward, but the aids to repair the village. Go and help people.zts5547e	Yes?? But it's not the work of the adventurers, so why do I have to do this?zts5548e	What is the adventurer supposed to do then? The village was destroyed and who can fix it? Demon? Lopello and his guards? If not, It's only you and Kovolts. Now, go!!zts5549e	(Pushing the back)zts5550e	Gee. Why do I have to do this kind of work. And how can I change the village by myself?zts5551e	Nothing is changed.zts5552e	Nothing is being changed at all.zts5553e	It's so boring.. Ok.. I will sing the song that I heard nearby the statue.. Ohh~Woo~ Oh? What is this?zts5554e	Wow. This is. Yes, this is the map that shows the location of Kovolts' treasure. I will ask to Sandra first.zts5555e	Sandra!zts5556e	Did you already finish it? And then, here is one more.zts5557e	No.. Wait.. Can you have a look at this?zts5558e	Wait..!! Oh my!! This is the map of treasure in the legend.. I can not believe it..zts5559e	(Is it real one??)zts5560e	Now, fixing work is finished. You leave now and get the treasure. I will give you the reward enough.zts5561e	This looks very precious!!zts5562e	What is this? What happened?zts5563e	Here it is. Take thiszts5564e	Wow.. What a great job you made. I will check how much they are.. Ah!! And Collin called you.zts5565e	Magician Collin? Got it, thankszts5566e	ACT 2 Quest _Kovolts and Catsyzts5567e	Did you call me?zts5568e	Hmmm. Today, my soul flew around TimeSpace and found that one of seeds of Fernon was growing. It looked like Dryad.zts5569e	D.. Dryad? You mean Fernon gets reviving now?zts5570e	Even if I could see only one bud, it may happen in other TimeSpace too. So, you have to nip the bud.zts5571e	Ahhh?? I can not go down here. I will go to the shop to buy some rope.zts5572e	Yes. Magician was right. Here are broken cocoon shields, and they look still fresh. I can not find anything inside or around them and it means they moved to somewhere.zts5573e	As you said, I could find the trace of something. But they seemed to go to somewhere.zts5574e	Hmmm.. I knew that. Chase them and destroy them.zts5575e	Catsy. Haha. Well. Why can't I concentrate on. OK. Let's report it first. Because I need to block Fernon. But Catsy. Ha..zts5576e	I did. Haha. I did see Catsy today. Haha.zts5577e	But why are you laughing? Did you see it first in your life?zts5578e	Yes. I was wondering what it was, but when I saw that. Haha.zts5579e	Well. I can understand you. If you see them first, it's natural. That disgusting species. By the way, check where they live. We need Catsy in any case of emergency such as the war or destroying Fernon.zts5580e	War??zts5581e	I mean the war between Kovolts and Catsyzts5582e	Hey. We just finished the war and you are talking about new war. Why do Kovolts hate Catsy? Even if they look weird, they don't seem to be dangerous.zts5583e	No reason. Just we hate each other from the time we were bornzts5584e	How ridiculous reason it is!!zts5585e	There are lots of things happening without the reason. Still you don't know it?zts5586e	But we will get critically damaged if we have to start another war. And what if we fight against each other, when Fernon is reviving.zts5587e	If it comes, Koarens or Catsy will manage to do it, because they don't want to be terminated together. Or in the worst case, human being can arbitrate. Anyway, let's think about their location at this time. I will tell you where they may be.zts5588e	It's narrow pathway. Did he mention it?zts5589e	Something seems to be here.zts5590e	No, It's not here, did it go to somewhere?zts5591e	I went to the place you mentioned, but Catsy was not there.zts5592e	Gee. These dirty species. They must run away. OK. I will show you other place.zts5593e	It's narrow pathway. Let's come in.zts5594e	What. Nothing's herezts5595e	Nothing was there, either. I wasted my time.zts5596e	Sorry about that, but this is new information from trustable source. Go there.zts5597e	They must be here..zts5598e	Ok. something may be here, Let's check.zts5599e	Gee. Nothing's here at allzts5600e	Nothing was there?? Just a moment.zts5601e	(Sandra went out and gave a chocolate bar to a little Kovolts)zts5602e	(What is she doing?)zts5603e	Now, I got it, This is definitely sure in this time.zts5604e	With chocolate bar only? Are you sure about it?zts5605e	Well.. Even if it's only a chocolate bar, anyway it's the reward. Once he took it, if the information is not true, he will be sorry for this. Now, go there and find Catsy!zts5606e	Hmmm.. I can not believe it, but will give the last try.zts5607e	Yes.. something's therezts5608e	Uhh.. It's to much!! I can't stand it anymore.. I would rather go to Eril.zts5609e	Eril!!zts5610e	Ah. Long time no see!! How are you?zts5611e	.. Well, to be honest with you, not good.zts5612e	Really? Do you have any problem? I heard that you were helping Sandra.zts5613e	As a matter of fact.zts5614e	. Explaining what has happened..zts5615e	Yes.. I understand.. Fernon tree is already.zts5616e	You didn't know that?zts5617e	Because the war was finished just now, we could not think about this.zts5618e	So, I need to find Catsy. Do you have any clue where they are?zts5619e	I don't have idea, but I know the pathway where Catsy pass through time to time.zts5620e	Ahhh!! Yes, Thanks Eril.zts5621e	What happened to Kenel? He fought to destroy Fernon before, and I thought I got to know him. If I don't do anything, nobody can destroy the tree in the future. I need to find Charlotte before Kenel doeszts5622e	ACT 2 Quest _Kovolts and Catsy 2zts5623e	Princess of Catsy? This is the chance. You.. You have to do your best in this time!zts5624e	Already I am doing my best!zts5625e	I can not emphasize it enough. I will introduce the source of information, so hurry up.zts5626e	As long as the information is correct.. (I am missing Eril)zts5627e	I will find it before Eril does!!zts5628e	recommended me to come here.. Ah? You are?zts5629e	I see you again, I need to get the hat.zts5630e	Hat?? What on earth are you talking about?zts5631e	Did you intend to get the information for free?zts5632e	No. No.. Surely, I will pay for that. Can any hat be fine?zts5633e	No way, I, as a fashion leader, can not wear any hat. Take it.zts5634e	Pickaxe? Do you mean I have to make a hat with pickaxe?zts5635e	Pish!! Do you mean to trade with me? If you don't have the clue, ask to Sandra. She may know about it.zts5636e	You came back early. Did he give you the information for free? It may not be possible.zts5637e	Right, He said he wanted a hat, and then, just gave me a pickaxe.zts5638e	Hohoho.. He was not changed. Use the pickaxe and bring some shining sand near the villagezts5639e	Yes. (How can she make a hat with sand?)zts5640e	How can I make a hat with this sand? Anyway, Sandra will handle it.zts5641e	Here it is, but are you going to make a sand hat?zts5642e	Don't be ridiculous. This sand is for decoration only.zts5643e	Ahh. Yes. I knew it. It was just a joke.zts5644e	That's ok, Hat is made by the cloth, so, now bring some good cloth.zts5645e	Hmm.. Yes, You brought the good onezts5646e	As I said, I knew that sand can not make a hat. I am not that stupid, you know. Right?zts5647e	Yes.. Yes.. It's enough. Just be quite and I will make you a good hat right now.zts5648e	(Sandra made a hat for herself)zts5649e	wow.. You are sewing.. I didn't know that you are so talented.zts5650e	It means you underestimated me. Ok, it's done, now it's turn. Take it and make a great job.zts5651e	Ok. I will return this with the useful information. Now the princess of Catsy went to the devil's hunting area. You go there and check it.zts5652e	Charlotte must leave it. I will ask to Sandra.zts5653e	What is this? Why Catsy is here? Only Kovolts are allowed to enter the fog valley.zts5654e	Fog valley? You mean Charlotte is there now?zts5655e	Probably. If it's true, it won't be easy.zts5656e	What do you mean?zts5657e	Fog valley, as its name shows, is filled up with the dense fog always. And it's not just mere fog, but the fog with poison, so nobody can not stay there even for short time. To make it worst, this valley is guarded by strong devil, in the name of 'Foggy Giant'zts5658e	Then, do we have to give up here?zts5659e	To be honest with you, we have one hope, but it's very dangerous, and I can not tell <pname> to do it. If you don't want, you can leave here.zts5660e	No, I also have to meet Charlotte. Please let me know what the hope is.zts5661e	If you want, I will tell you. Once in every month, Mt. Krem is surrounded by mysterious twilight. If you make a mask which has this mysterious force, you can protect yourself from the poison. Fortunately, today is that day. Go to Mt. Krem with this cloth, and leave it there and it will turn into red. And then, bring it back tomorrow. I will make a mask out of the cloth.zts5662e	The cloth turns to red!!zts5663e	Here is the mask.zts5664e	Thanks. Now I will go to search for Charlotte.zts5665e	Just.. Just momentzts5666e	It won't be easy, so take good care of you.zts5667e	Hmm. I feel something's not good. By the way, what is that?zts5668e	They are Kenel and Charlotte. What.. What do I have to do? I don't know, but I can not leave Charlotte there.zts5669e	Sandra!! Charlotte was kidnapped by Kenel!!zts5670e	What? And did you just watch Kenel kidnapping her?zts5671e	There's nothing I could do. Even Charlotte seemed to allow it. But I have to rescue her, do you know where she is?zts5672e	If she was kidnapped by Kenel, she must be kept in underground prison. It is.zts5673e	Underground prison? Where is it?zts5674e	Let me finish. Nobody knows the location except for old gurus of Kovoltszts5675e	And then, I will ask to the guru.zts5676e	Hmmm.. but he won't tell you the location for freezts5677e	Young man, what brought you here?zts5678e	Yes, I want to know where the underground prison is.zts5679e	Young man, we don't disclose our secret to other species.zts5680e	I know, but it's very important, and I will do whatever you may request, if you tell me about it. Please.zts5681e	Haha.. If you are so desperate, bring the tooth of beast. If you can do it alive, I will tell you.zts5682e	Do it alive??zts5683e	Haha.. Yes. Bring the tooth of legendary leopard. But to reach it, you have to go through the holly area of Kovolts' warriors. If you can not pass it, you can't reach the leopard. But the souls of the warrior won't you pass it. Hahazts5684e	(As Sandra said, he doesn't want to help me) . Ok, I will. I will bring it alive. But you have to keep your promise, when I come back.zts5685e	Heee!! This is a monster. As the old guru said, I could be almost dead. You old man, if you don't keep the promise, you will be sorry for this!zts5686e	Here it is, the tooth of the leopard!zts5687e	What? Is it really the tooth? No way, it's not possible. It's the leopard in legend, you could not do it!!zts5688e	What you see now says what I did. It was so dangerous, but finally I made it!zts5689e	pish!! I know you are cheating me. You brought the fake one and insist it's from the leopard. Do you think you can deceive me?zts5690e	Woo!! I can not stand it any more!!zts5691e	No. Calm down, it's my joke. In my second look, I see it's the tooth of the leopard.zts5692e	Pish!!zts5693e	(It's so shameful of me.) Hmm. So, you want to know about the underground prison, right? I will tell you.zts5694e	I didn't expect Kenel to do this. He may hurt Charlotte.zts5695e	Of course, family head and assistant can not leave the family. Also, if the member leaves the family, he/she can not make or join the new family within one day.zts5696e	Sandra (In use)zts5697e	Sandra_main questzts5698e	Lv.56 Noscamp Mt. Kremzts5699e	Lv.58 Kovolts and Catsyzts5700e	Lv.60 Resurrection of Kenkozts5701e	Bill main questzts5702e	Lv.62 Death of Kenkozts5703e	Shinbone valley is the sacred place that even we Kovolts hardly step cross it. You go there and persuade our 8 ancestor gods to believe that this energy did not come from human society. And wash them with the pure juice of fruits and have their power to get rid of this evil energy.zts5704e	Magician, the status remains broken!zts5705e	Hew. It's very heavy. By the way, what is Catsy? Ah. And who do I have to ask to fix the statue? I don't know who has the talent for this. Do I ask to Smith first, because his job looks similar? Hmm. However, it's not the weapon, but the artist's work, so is it Sam?zts5706e	(Reported it to Sandra)zts5707e	Catsy.. They are the enemy of Kovolts.zts5708e	Hmm. If I make a good job, every Kovolt will love me!zts5709e	Why Kovolts can not get along with Catsy?zts5710e	You have to catch Catsy before others do! I know one place which Catsy like, check the place first!zts5711e	Hey~zts5712e	Start!zts5713e	Really? I have another information, It will be definitely sure this time.zts5714e	Catsy was not there. I just hunted devils.zts5715e	Because they rarely expose themselves to outside. But my source is wide.zts5716e	This direction. You go there.zts5717e	Just moment, I will check it and let you knowzts5718e	After for a whilezts5719e	I am not sure, but someone said he saw Catsy in some place. Will you try it?zts5720e	Ah. But I heard that Kovolts are rushing there.zts5721e	Ah. Ok.zts5722e	There must be some miscommunication. But one sure thing is that I have to find the princess of Catsy before Kenel does.zts5723e	Princess of Catsy? This is the chance. You.. You have to do your best in this time!zts5724e	Yes, I know that. But you have to give me the correct information this time.zts5725e	Sure I will. I will introduce the best source. Hurry up.zts5726e	Is it the place Sandra mentioned?zts5727e	Sandra told me to come here. Uh? You are.zts5728e	You, again!! Do something to the guys other there. They are so noisy!!zts5729e	Guys out there?zts5730e	Yes.. over there. Keep them away or make them quite. They are so irritating me!!zts5731e	But why do I have to follow your order?zts5732e	Didn't you come here to get some thing? If not, that's ok. Don't bother yourself.zts5733e	No.. no.. I will handle this, and come back right now.zts5734e	Hew.. Now, they will be quite. I hope it makes him keep the promise..zts5735e	Yes, It's quite now. Also I want to have a hat.zts5736e	Don't you need the information?zts5737e	Ok.. Good. Now, I will give you the information. Go to this point I show you now.zts5738e	Wrote [Fog valley] with lipstick on the hand mirrorzts5739e	It must be the clue that Catsy princess left. I will ask to Sandra.zts5740e	Hmmm.. Foggy valleyzts5741e	What kind of the place is it?zts5742e	Fog valley, as its name shows, is filled up with the dense fog always. And it's not just mere fog, but the fog with poison, so nobody can not stay there even for short time. To make it worst, this valley is guarded by strong devil, in the name of 'Foggy Giant'zts5743e	Really.. And then, what do I have to do?zts5744e	There's nothing I can do to the devil, but I can make a mask for you. It will protect you from being poisonedzts5745e	Mask which dyed with the twilight can prevent the poison of Foggy valleyzts5746e	How can I get that?zts5747e	You can get the most power of twilight at the end of Mt. Krem cliff. Go there.zts5748e	If you leave the cloth on the place facing the twilight, its color will be changed to red.zts5749e	Thanks. And I will go to find Catsy princesszts5750e	We spent too much time. Do you know how important this mission is for our Noscamp?zts5751e	Yes of course. (She started nagging again.)zts5752e	I thought it's fog, but it was a devil. Very strong devil. Hew~ What if I didn't bring this mask. I don't want to even imagine.zts5753e	What? Do you mean that we lost the opportunity to make an achievement?zts5754e	Sandra!! It's not important.zts5755e	Yes.. It's IMPORTANT!!zts5756e	Sandra, Calm down, please.zts5757e	Do you know so far, how many times we have lost the chances?zts5758e	I know it well, but the chance to make the bigger achievement is coming.zts5759e	What do you mean? Do you mean we have another chance?zts5760e	Do you remember that Charlotte is essential to seal Fernon?zts5761e	If we can rescue her and seal Fernon again, what can be bigger than this achievement?zts5762e	Hmmm.zts5763e	Kenel kidnapped her only because of old grudge of his species.zts5764e	If we can not rescue her, we will lose the chance to seal Fernon. We have to find her immediately.zts5765e	Hmm. If she's imprisoned by Kenel, she must be in underground prison now.zts5766e	Well.. Because the place has not been used for long time, even young Kovolts don't know about its existence.zts5767e	Probably some of old Kovolts may remember it.zts5768e	Old kovolt. Ah. He..zts5769e	Now, you must not fail again. You have to make the success for Noscamp Mt. Krem branch. Do you understand?zts5770e	I know it's very difficult to tell me, but I have to know it by all means. I will do whatever you may request, so please, give me a chance.zts5771e	Haha.. Yes. Bring the tooth of legendary leopard. But to reach it, you have to go through the holly area of Kovolts' warriors. If you can not pass it, you can't reach the leopard. But the souls of the warrior won't you pass it. Hahazts5772e	Ok, I will. I will bring it alive. But you have to keep your promise, when I come back.zts5773e	Huk!! This is a monster. As the old man said, I could be almost dead.zts5774e	The pact for peace has been agreed by both. But to make it, we have to go through long way.zts5775e	ACT 2 Quest. The resurrection of Kenkozts5776e	Explained to Sandrazts5777e	The peace pact between Kovolt and Catsy. It sounds great but they never get along with each other, so it may be extremely difficult to make it.zts5778e	I know, but at least I want to try. Do you know where Cenil is?zts5779e	Hmm. I know. By the way.. Take a look at this.zts5780e	What is this?zts5781e	You may hear that a lot of treasures are hidden inside of Mt. Krem. This map is one of the treasure maps.zts5782e	Sandra! It's not the right time to think about the treasure.zts5783e	Listen. The treasure in Mt. Krem originally belonged to Kovolts, so you may offend them, and they will hate you.zts5784e	I know, so even with giving this gift, we have to get their favors and heart, Do you understand?zts5785e	Sandra.zts5786e	Why, are you surprised? Once I set the goal, I will do whatever to achieve it. Now, go!zts5787e	I am sorry. I didn't know that, and thought that you were always thinking about the treasure.zts5788e	Hoho. Now, leave!zts5789e	Hmm.. Sandra is very thoughtful. So far I thought she's merely greedy on the achievement.zts5790e	Good job.zts5791e	Yes, I feel also good. By the way, did you find Cenil?zts5792e	Yes, I did. But I guess Kenel tries to disturb your plan.zts5793e	Who? Kenel?zts5794e	Yes, He doesn't want to change the old tradition, working together with Catsy. He doesn't like it at all.zts5795e	Kenel. I hope he's not in my way.zts5796e	Keep your eyes on him.zts5797e	How stupid I was. I should haven't trusted Darksy, and given him the letter. Anyway, finding Cenil is the most urgent.zts5798e	But.. where can I find him? Mt. Krem is becoming dangerous and I can not go back to Anni! Right.. Eril. I have Eril.zts5799e	Hi, Long time no see. By the way, there's any problems? You look pale.zts5800e	Yes. It is. to be honest with you.zts5801e	Explaining everything.zts5802e	I don't understand why they don't like to live with others in peace.zts5803e	Me, neither. So do you know where can I meet Cenil?zts5804e	The other day, he came to the village, and said he was investigating Kovolts' village. I think he's still nearbyzts5805e	Ah.. Thanks. I will run to find him.zts5806e	You're welcome. I hope you have the luck.zts5807e	What do I have to do? Two species, Kovolt and Catsy. They are so complicated beings. At this moment, I don't have any other choice but to trust Darksy. Do I have to inform Sandra?zts5808e	You are back. How was the work going?zts5809e	Honestly, even I don't know what is happening here.zts5810e	I didn't expect a lot. From the beginning, it was not easy to arbitrate them.. Ah!! By the way, magician looked for you urgently.zts5811e	Magician Collin? Hmm. Why?zts5812e	You human being, Finally, you came to me. I couldn't sleep because of the incremental concerns.zts5813e	What do you mean? Any problem?zts5814e	Yes.. Kenko seems to do something evil. You have to block him before his power grows. When you were not here, I sent some agents to check his location. Now, go to the village chief and ask where he is. Hurry, human being.zts5815e	Oh.. Welcome. I heard from Collin that you came back, and just become relieved.zts5816e	How do you do sir, I heard that your agents are searching for Kenko's location. Did they find it?zts5817e	Yes, my agents will tell you the place spy of Kenko visits often. Catch him and ask where Kenko is.zts5818e	What is this? Something was written here.zts5819e	Here are another. Look, both can be assembled. Originally, these must be one.zts5820e	Of course, it's combined here. Now, I need one more part to complete it.zts5821e	Here it is. Finally I got all parts, But I can not read it.. Is it the words of Kenko? If so, Koaren may read this.zts5822e	Sir, I found the clue.zts5823e	Welcome. Let me see what you found.zts5824e	It looks like a letter, but I can not read it.zts5825e	Hmm. This is the military plan of Kenko. Now I know what he think, and need to block it right now.zts5826e	I will go!!zts5827e	Yes.. You may be the only person who dare to face Kenko. Demons seemed to join it already, so be careful.zts5828e	Charlotte was kidnapped by Kenko.. So what do I have to do? If Kenko hides himself, nobody can find him, and in case something terrible happens to Charlotte, Kovolts and Catsy can not make up with each other forever.zts5829e	Yes.. Right. I remember that Catsy use very strange perfume. I can use the same tricks as I used it before.. Haha..zts5830e	ACT 2 Quest. The death of Kenko.zts5831e	Long time no talk. What brought you here? If you need the better item, just tell me.zts5832e	Haha.. It's not for that today. I just want to meet Morgan, but can't find him. Do you know where he is?zts5833e	He left just before. But don't you think you can put more trust on me, so, come on. Tell me.zts5834e	I just came here for other business. I will come back to you when I have deeper pocket.zts5835e	Hey, Long time to see. How have you been?zts5836e	Yes, How are you? And I need to use 'sniffer' bug, so am wondering if I can get the catch net.zts5837e	Pish!! You come to me only if you need something. If you don't need anything, you won't visit me, will you?zts5838e	So sorry about that, but I have been so busy.zts5839e	Yes.. I understand you. The adventurer with great ability must be so busy. It's natural. Anyway, here is the net.zts5840e	Do you give it for free?zts5841e	Yes.. It's the special gift to my old friend. But it is free only for TODAY..zts5842e	(Wow, I didn't expect him to give it for free) . Thanks.. Thank you so much.zts5843e	Uhhh. You ugly bug. But I respect the sense of your smell. Now, here you go and find Charlotte.zts5844e	Did you hear that I said 'ugly'? Why don't you go? Hey. Are you angry with me? Sorry. It's a joke, so let's go!zts5845e	Puhaha!! This bug follows only after it smells it. How stupid I am.. haha.zts5846e	(<pname> looks around)zts5847e	He!! Nobody saw me, Haha.. Because Eril is a close friend of Catlotte, he may know what perfume Catlotte uses.zts5848e	What? Charlotte was kidnapped by Kenko? Oh, my. It's terrible. We have to find her right now!zts5849e	Yes, you're right, so we have to find Kenko first. Do you know what kind of perfume she uses?zts5850e	Yes, I gave it to her as a gift, also I have the same one with me.zts5851e	Great!! And then, let this 'Sniffer' smell it.zts5852e	Sure, Just moment.zts5853e	(He allows Sniffer to smell the perfume)zts5854e	Wow.. Now it starts moving. Thanks Eril.zts5855e	Welcome, and please hurry. Charlotte is in danger now.zts5856e	Hukk!! This place is so dangerous. There are many devils and they won't let me pass here peacefully.zts5857e	Hew~ I barely made it. These were so strong.zts5858e	She must be around here.. Now, let's break the team. I will go in this way, so you check that way.zts5859e	One broom is here. Uhhh? Something was on it. Is it the message of Catsy?zts5860e	(One rose in the gloomy place. But when it blooms with the beam, the peace will be brought forever.)zts5861e	Rose and what? Ahhh. Rose and Catsy. Does this rose mean that 'Rosebud knight' of Catsy?zts5862e	Hmm.. This message may have deeper meaning. I will have closer look.zts5863e	Probably, 'gloomy place' means here this place. But where is the rose? And how can rose be shining with the beam? Is it not the real rose? I don't know but let's check around.zts5864e	Uhh?? This is the picture of rose? It's shinning, and then, the message on the broom must point it out. There must be some secret inside of this picture. I will check it.zts5865e	Hmmm. Nothing seems to be inside.. But this is a really great picture. It looks like a real one.zts5866e	(When the rose gets touched, suddenly small pathway comes on the wall)zts5867e	Haha.. Is it a secret pathway? I feel myself as a hero in the movie. Ok, if I am the hero, I will check it out.zts5868e	RoseBud knight 1 : Who is it there?zts5869e	Hukk!! RoseBud knights?zts5870e	RoseBud knight 2 : If you come to know about this place, you can not leave here alive. Brothers!! Attack him!!zts5871e	Just.. Just moment.. Calm down..zts5872e	RoseBud knight 1 : How can that weak human being beat us?zts5873e	Hey.. you guys. I am on your side. I am on my way to find Charlotte and found this place by chance.zts5874e	RoseBud knight 2 : And then, are you the adventurer who helped our princess?zts5875e	Yes.. You are right, I am that guy.zts5876e	RoseBud 1 : If you are that adventurer, can you help us? We could manage Kovolts, but too many Demons are there, and it's beyond our power.zts5877e	Do you know where Charlotte is?zts5878e	RoseBud 1 : Go to the place we had the last battle. But since we had fight, some time passed and we are not sure if she's still there.zts5879e	It must be the place.. It's also full of devils. They won't allow me to pass peacefully.zts5880e	*Out of breath*. From where these large number of devils are coming from? Is the chasm of TimeSpace getting wider?zts5881e	I hope Charlotte is still ok. But much time has passed, so if we don't hurry, something really terrible may happen to her.zts5882e	Trace is going down. Let' hurry.zts5883e	Uhhh!! Ok, you dirty devils. Here I will go. I will terminate all of you.zts5884e	Hew~ I hope it works for time being. Now, I need to go in a haste.zts5885e	Now, where do we have to go?zts5886e	We spent too much time. If he wants to resurrect Fernon with the power of Charlotte, he must bring her to the hidden alter.zts5887e	Hidden alter?zts5888e	Yes. To break the seal of Fernon, the ritual has to be conducted on the hidden alter.zts5889e	And then, let's go there.zts5890e	However, this alter was protected with the magic net in that name of 'labyrinth of pain'. Without breaking it, nobody can enter it.zts5891e	What are you afraid of? If we are working together, nothing can be in our way. Let's break it now.zts5892e	Haha.. You sounds very confident. Good!! But you must be very careful.zts5893e	Somewhere over there is the center of the labyrinth where the alter starts.zts5894e	Uhhh. What is this disgusting statue for?zts5895e	To enter the center of the labyrinth, we have to break it, first.zts5896e	Haha. Ok, I will break it with one fist. Yap!zts5897e	(Trying to break it, but can not give even a scratch)zts5898e	No way.. It's not possible.zts5899e	It's not your fault. People call it as 'Statue of Crying'. Nobody can break it without the hammer of guardian in this place.zts5900e	Guardian? Where is it?zts5901e	Hahaha!! I like it!!zts5902e	Who are these dudes? They are using ugly-looking hammers.zts5903e	Right, It look ugly, but very strong. If we didn't work together, we would be hunted by them.zts5904e	It was so easily broken by the hammer.zts5905e	Hurry up!! We have to finish it quickly!!zts5906e	Wait a second!!zts5907e	This key.. Something's strange. Look at this. The decoration has been damaged.zts5908e	This gem is. It's black diamond. But see this. The decorations for diamonds are 5, meanwhile there is only one diamond.zts5909e	And then, what do we have to do?zts5910e	Do you mean 'black diamond'? Is it shining stone in black? If so, I know where to get it.zts5911e	Really? Let's go there.zts5912e	Now, we have the diamonds, but how can we put them into the decorations?zts5913e	Leave it to me. In my village, we have the great smith in decorating accessories.zts5914e	<pname>!! It's been long time since I met you. How are you? I heard that you are quite busy these days.zts5915e	Yes, How are you? Hmm. to be frankly with you.zts5916e	What? Resurrection of Fernon? It's so terrible. Let me see the key, I will fix it now.zts5917e	(Celloin quickly enters his operation room with the key)zts5918e	Here is the key. Look at this. Isn't it adorable?zts5919e	Thanks, Celloin.zts5920e	Don't say that. Just go with the key and help all.zts5921e	Charlotte : Thanks for your help, you great knight.zts5922e	Player : Don't say that. I just did my duty. The guys here deserve your gratitude.zts5923e	Charlotte :Patty, also you came here.zts5924e	Patty: You must have harder time than I have. Now, everything turns out to be ok. And from now on, we don't have to fight against Kovolts. Right, Sir. Kenel?zts5925e	Kenel : *Clearing the throat* Hmm.. I don't know much about that. I just follow the order of my highness.zts5926e	Charlotte : Aha!! So that's why you didn't obey KuruKoaren and imprisoned me?zts5927e	Kenel : So what? Are you angry with me? Krrrr.zts5928e	Charlotte : Hoho!! It's a joke. We really appreciate your help, Sir Kenel.zts5930e	Hew. it's very heavy.zts5931e	(Passing the clay)zts5932e	Yes, about the relationship with Kovolts, leave it to Sandra. By the way, anybody knows where Cenil is?zts5933e	Over there, it's the center of 'Labyrinth of pain'. Hey!! You brave man. Are you ready?zts5934e	Haha.. I feel my body so powerful and itching with Patty and Kenel. Let's go!!zts5935e	Patty: You must have harder time than I have. Now, everything turns out to be ok. And from now on, we don't have to fight against Kovolts. Right, Sir. Kenel?zts5936e	Thanks for rescuing me, you brave knight!zts5937e	Don't say that. I just did my duty. The guys here deserve your gratitude.zts5938e	Patty, also you came here.zts5939e	You must have harder time than I have. Now, everything turns out to be ok. And from now on, we don't have to fight against Kovolts. Right, Sir. Kenel?zts5940e	*Clearing the throat* Hmm.. I don't know much about that. I just follow the order of my highness.zts5941e	Aha!! So that's why you didn't obey KuruKoaren and imprisoned me?zts5942e	So what? Are you still angry with me? Krrrr.zts5943e	Hoho!! It's a joke. We really appreciate your help, Sir Kenel.zts5944e	Haha.. It looks so nice. If we three species can work together, we can overcome anything in the future.zts5945e	Participate in Holiday eventzts5946e	Hey!! It's the holiday of Milano.zts5947e	But.. now, the monster 'Tri-angles' are messing up the village.zts5948e	If you hunt them, you can get the treasure box with gifts.zts5949e	If you are lucky, you can also get the special pet. Do you want to try?zts5950e	Now, we will give the seal to anyone who brings the item as belowzts5951e	Out of Event rice, Event meat and Event bamboo leaves, pick one and bring 10 items.zts5952e	And pay 20,000 Gold, and then we will give the seal.zts5953e	Challenge it before it's too late!!zts5954e	Get the seal for holiday event.zts5955e	High score boardzts5956e	Challenge [TimeSpace Score]zts5957e	Receive the quest and enter in [Record Challenge]zts5958e	If you get the higher score than the quest requests you, this quest will be cleared.zts5959e	If you clear all quests, you will get many rewards, so challenge them now!zts5960e	Once the quest is cleared, you can not join it again.zts5961e	Score Quest for low level.zts5962e	Score Quest for middle level.zts5963e	Score Quest for high level.zts5964e	The dialogue is finishedzts5965e	This is the score quest for low level players.zts5966e	Lv.1 ~ Lv.10 Score Questzts5967e	Lv.12 ~ Lv.20 Score Questzts5968e	Lv.21 ~ Lv.25 Score Questzts5969e	This is the score quest for middle level playerszts5970e	Lv.26 ~ Lv.30 Score Questzts5971e	Lv.31 ~ Lv.35 Score Questzts5972e	Lv.36 ~ Lv.40 Score Questzts5973e	Lv.41 ~ Lv.45 Score Questzts5974e	Lv.46 ~ Lv.49 Score Questzts5975e	This is the score quest for high level playerszts5976e	Lv.50 ~ Lv.52 Score Questzts5977e	Lv.53 ~ Lv.55 Score Questzts5978e	Lv.56 ~ Lv.58 Score Questzts5979e	Lv.59 ~ Lv.61 Score Questzts5980e	Lv.62 ~ Lv.63 Score Questzts5981e	Lv.64 ~ Lv.65 Score Questzts5982e	Apply to Land conquest battlezts5983e	The land of Deathzts5984e	Only family member is allowed to enter the land of Deathzts5985e	Enter the land of Deathzts5986e	Oh?

It becomes you very well.zts5990e	Really? Thank you. Actually, I don't wear often such a dress so I am a little embarrassed.zts5991e	You are so beautiful! Well, did you declare your love for him?zts5992e	No, I didn't yet.zts5993e	(She don't still tell him. However I am quite surprised that she is wearing that kind of clothes.)zts5994e	Ah? Celloin, the dress is..?zts5995e	Hi, thank you. Does it fit me well?zts5996e	Sure, you are so beautiful!zts5997e	Thank you. But I am a little embarrassed, because I don't wear often such a dress.zts5998e	Haha. Don't be embarrassed, you are so nice.zts5999e	Thank you for saying so, <pname>.zts6000e	Anyway, did you tell your love to Sellbig?zts6001e	Well, I didn't tell him yet..zts6002e	(She didn't. I should think the other way.)zts6003e	Ah! Celloin, you put on the dress!zts6004e	Yes, thank you, <pname>. Does it fit me well?zts6005e	Sure, you are so beautiful.zts6006e	Thank you for saying so, <pname>zts6007e	So, did you tell your love to Sellbig?zts6008e	Well, I didn't.zts6009e	Wasn't the dress good?zts6010e	No! Never! It is because of me.zts6011e	She didn't tell him, but she felt something. Ok, I will help her until she tell her love to him!!)zts6012e	Wow~ we see again.zts6013e	Go and catch KrrKoaren!! Kill all the runaways!!zts6014e	Check how many times I am recommended.zts6015e	Act3 Quest_Investigate Fastone labzts6016e	wow. A body with warrior Kovolt's spirit. Awesome.zts6017e	Hemhem. (Hm? Something strange.. is this a appreciation or a joke?)zts6018e	You made Mt. Krem famous. Patron wants to see you to appreciate. Go on to see him.zts6019e	Yup!zts6020e	What are you doing? Hurry up. Ah. One thing. If the patron gives you a good present, that is mine.zts6021e	Welcome. I am told from Kenel that you beat Kuluk Kuluk Kin, the menace of our Koaren. Thank you very much.zts6022e	You're welcomezts6023e	I am dubbing you as a Koaren's Warrior to appreciate your contribution to us.zts6024e	(Ur Koaren paused, then shout)zts6025e	Your name is now 'Kang Kang Koaren'. May the Ginas bless this warrior.zts6026e	(Koarens ovate as they heard the announcement)zts6027e	God bless Kang Kang Koaren!zts6028e	(With depression) Hooray.zts6029e	Enjoy the party. Today we have a new warrior - Let's celebrate the new born warriorzts6030e	(Alex approaches as the party gets more exciting)zts6031e	Sandra is calling. She says something but I don't get it.zts6032e	Sandra? OK. I got itzts6033e	Welcome, 'Kang Kang Koaren'. Now you become a Kovoltzts6034e	(What the heck) Please stop.zts6035e	(Even though she has desperate looking eyes, but her eyes are also pressing laughs)zts6036e	I came here as I heard there is something urgentzts6037e	Urgent? Oh. right. Did Alex send you?zts6038e	right.zts6039e	(Sandra mumbles while biting her nails)zts6040e	(What is in their mind?)zts6041e	here.zts6042e	(Sandra hands over big pile of paper roll to <pname>)zts6043e	Eh. what is this?zts6044e	it's works to be done.. your work.zts6045e	eh? I was told there is nothing to do for a whilezts6046e	what you heard is wrongzts6047e	(Something got to be wrong)zts6048e	In fact, there is no one in charge as former responsible person ran away. I have tried to convince for 2 hours. the only people from Noscamp is you and me now.zts6049e	Oh, boy.. What am I supposed to do?zts6050e	Bring the paper to Fastone lab, then make up a report. I am being told there are something strange is happening in the lab. It shouldn't be dangerous, so don't be worried.zts6051e	(He must be hiding something.) All of these?zts6052e	Yes. All of them. You know how to use them, right?zts6053e	isn't this just a paper?zts6054e	It is a magic paper you could see the map around where you are, when you call the charms.zts6055e	What are the charms?zts6056e	The charm is 'I am Kang Kang Koaren'. Call it loud and bright.zts6057e	Yeah. (Is this a joke?)zts6058e	Browse the lab's information that I have attached. Good luck. Don't forget how to use the paper. Hoho.zts6059e	(He read a report named 'Report by Noscamp adventurer')zts6060e	1) it's a dark place. Something is dragging my legs. There is nothing seen.zts6061e	2) This place is inaccessible even to Kovolts. According to Koaren's, Unidentified object comes out of the lab at nights. No one wants to be near.zts6062e	3) Lord Rofeller shut down this place. I wonder why Lord Rofeller shut down by himself?zts6063e	4) mid tier adventurers joined the investigation but disappeared. Entering the lab to find out details. Communication disconnected.zts6064e	5) Only allowed to highest tier adventurers. Force mission is not allowed: only for volunteers. By Rofello.zts6065e	(Emotionlessly crushes the paper)zts6066e	Highest tier. Volunteers only?? What the.. I am deceived. Someone has to pay the price to me.zts6067e	(Wakes up from the bed suddenly)zts6068e	Morning.zts6069e	Boo!zts6070e	(Surprising action)zts6071e	Good morning. You got injured badly)zts6072e	Thanks for worrying me. But.zts6073e	Who brought you to here? It's Alex over there. I was surprised when Alex dropped you on the ground.zts6074e	(Alex is sleeping stone dead)zts6075e	(Thanks, Alex)zts6076e	Just to let you know, I did the bandage work for you. I will charge you from the consultation fee. Bring me the report ASAP.zts6077e	That's not fair, I am still injured.zts6078e	Huhu. I have treated you with 'Heal everything'. It was worthwhile for me to get the maximum effect for Mt. Krem post.zts6079e	uuuk.zts6080e	(He explains what happened at the lab)zts6081e	so you are saying something is wrong?zts6082e	yes. The report is a little different than other reports. I think there is something hidden there.zts6083e	Hmm. Something fishy is going on there.zts6084e	Fishy?zts6085e	Yeah. The money. High risk, high return! That level or risk might mean high accomplishment as well as hidden jewelries.zts6086e	(What kind of person is this?)zts6087e	good. It's a dangerous place, so let's ask to Alex to go there together.zts6088e	Aware. Any found jewelry is mine!zts6089e	To Fastone lab?zts6090e	yes. It's dangerous alone. I would like Alex's help.zts6091e	There is smell of zombies only. I don't want to go, but Sandra would push me anyway. I need to do some prep work, so you go ahead.zts6092e	See you at the 2nd level of the labzts6093e	OKzts6094e	The shadow of Ginas. Hmm. This would do for the initial investigationzts6095e	Huhu. the 'Heal everything' potion certainly works. This report handout would cover accomplishment shortage and would be able to get more money. I could make additional savings account. hoho job well done!!zts6096e	Empty dialoguezts6097e	Act3 Quest_Everybody became strange.zts6098e	Who knows well about the ring?zts6099e	Act3 Quest_Everybody became strange.zts6100e	(Two rings of Radal is shown. Celloin has eyes of curiosity)zts6101e	The rings are blue and red. It seems it has strange power. Some kind of charms are hidden in there.zts6102e	Do you know what they are?zts6103e	Wait a second.zts6104e	(Celloin shakes her head after investigating for a while)zts6105e	I can't find what it is. It seems it has some kinds of dark charms..zts6106e	Would there be anyone who knows well about this?zts6107e	Probably Catsi know better than mezts6108e	(Charlotte says she would stay in Koaren for a while, Ur Koaren should know)zts6109e	Catsis? They are not in town. They were complaining around, about food, stiff bed, etc..zts6110e	so you kick them out?zts6111e	what do you think of me. I can't kick out who help Koaren's from danger world. They said they are looking for better place they could feel comfortable.zts6112e	Do you know where they went?zts6113e	I asked Krr to guard - I was told they would stop by Milano town on the way.zts6114e	Catsis? Ah, I have seen them. They said they are looking for friends. Wouldn't it be Eril, the only friends in Milano town?zts6115e	Hi. Yes? Ah. Charlotte and Patrisha? They were complaining about Koarens in Mt. Krem. They said they are looking for a new place to settle. I think they went to fir woodszts6116e	Do I know the pearl of the dusk? Of course. I can't think of anybody who loves jewelry doesn't know that legendary pearl. According to the legend, the thousand-year-old clam lives in the underwater cave below the cliff. I never checked with my naked eyes but I am sure that is true. However, there is one problem.zts6117e	Problem?zts6118e	The legend says a Sorcerer put a stone statue at the entrance of the cave to protect the clam.zts6119e	then does that mean I can't meet the clam?zts6120e	That I am saying is. you need a special element to open the seal. The statue is to protect from evil creatures. The legend says if you put cold heart, pure wild flower, and passion flower to the mouth of the statue, then the door would open.zts6121e	Where can I find them?zts6122e	Ice Cot has the cold heart. And the wild flower and passion flower is at the top of the cliff. The cliff is located at the northern skirt of Mt. Krem, so you should be careful.zts6123e	Thanks.zts6124e	Hew. this is so high.zts6125e	Now I got the Cold Heart, now I need to get the flowers. I should go to the cliff now.zts6126e	now I got them all. I should go to see the clam now.zts6127e	good. I am going in.zts6128e	I should let Charlotte know about this.zts6129e	Did you bring the things I have asked?zts6130e	Something happened.zts6131e	(Explains what happened to Charlotte)zts6132e	You shouldn't do this.zts6133e	(Hand out the Wild Flower to Charlotte)zts6134e	I was asked to hand this to you. And he said he would retrieve.zts6135e	Oh. This is so beautiful. I will keep this in safe place. Thank you so much.zts6136e	Sister~ can you put this flower to vase?zts6137e	Yes, sister.zts6138e	Ah. We don't have water to keep flowers. What do we do. We need water to keep the flowers alive.zts6139e	What water?zts6140e	it should be very clean pure water.zts6141e	that's simple. Got it. Where can I get clear water?zts6142e	Hm. right. The water near Milano town would be good.zts6143e	This is not suitable. This type of water only damages the Wild Flower. I am sorry. You should get clearer water.zts6144e	Let's try northern side of Milano, OK? Please.zts6145e	This is same as the last one. The water is getting more polluted.zts6146e	How about the water from the Plain?zts6147e	This is rather a poison than water.zts6148e	All of water you are bringing is not good. Are you sure you brought them by yourself? This must be water that Milano people drink.zts6149e	(Hm.. that is a problem if the drinking water is polluted)zts6150e	I am worried about Eril. Any wrong thing should not happen.zts6151e	Not good. (Sob) My tear is not stopping. What should I do? Don't I look foolish?zts6152e	No, not at all.zts6153e	I am a fool. Crying all the time. What if everybody don't like me.. (Sob)zts6154e	Don't cry, you are not a foolzts6155e	I was out for a walk into Fir woods and maple woods. then. (Sob, sob crying)zts6156e	what happened? Tell me what happened.zts6157e	(Sob, sob) there were slippery and ill feeling lizards.zts6158e	It was so eerie. And it was gross. I think I can't stop crying because of them. I wish they were dead. Please hunt down all the lizards.zts6159e	are you sure?zts6160e	(It looked like Eril would crying more and more if there is no actions)zts6161e	I feel gloomy. (Sob, sob) why am I feel this gloomy?zts6162e	May it is not because of the lizards. (Sob) I need something to lighten up. (Sob) Celloin once told me dressing up would help change feelings.zts6163e	yeah? Sure..?zts6164e	Racoony tails from Fir woods and Maple woods were so beautiful. Wouldn't it be so nice to make a hat with those tails? I think I would be better off with the hat.. (Sob) it should be so nice. (Sob)zts6165e	(It is getting more strange.)zts6166e	When I look into it, the Racoony tail isn't that beautiful. (Sob) thanks, but I don't like it. Still I am so gloomy. Leave me alone. (Crying)zts6167e	Hey, come over here.zts6168e	Hey. welcome.zts6169e	Are you listening to me? Clean up your ears.. I don't like dirty people.zts6170e	(Strange again)zts6171e	what are you mumbling at? Are your trying on me? Eh?zts6172e	I heard Celloin tripped over when she saw Wood zombies at Fir Woods. How sad is this?zts6173e	How come it's sad?zts6174e	what? Are you bringing it on me? Want some treat?zts6175e	No.zts6176e	eh. Poor boy. I need to pay back to them. You do the actual payback work, got it? But you are not strong enough to deal with Wood zombies. You might want to try Stumps nearby. Can you do that?zts6177e	I will tryzts6178e	Where is your spirit! Your voice is not convincing. You are not trying, but you have to. Got it?zts6179e	Yes.zts6180e	Don't be boasting around. This time is zombies. Off you go.zts6181e	You are not useless as I thought. Now Wood zombies gone, I am showing myself up to Celloin. Hahahazts6182e	Everybody is strange. How can I solve this problem? I need to find out the root cause.zts6183e	(Long thinking and a hand clap)zts6184e	Charlotte says the water become more polluted as she went up against the stream. There must be something in the upper streamzts6185e	Something passed by. What would that be?zts6186e	The traces are going this way. hm..? Monsters are erasing those traces. I need to get things organized to track the traces.zts6187e	traces are going this way.. what caused the water pollution? Will these traces have any connection?zts6188e	(Something is moving nearby)zts6189e	Water become clear when Larvae gone.zts6190e	This water shouldn't be polluted.zts6191e	Let's bring this water to Charlottezts6192e	Now there is no bad smell from water. Wild flower will be OK with this water. Thanks.zts6193e	By the way, how's Eril? Is she OK?zts6194e	I am going to visit.zts6195e	I am worried. Go on visit Milano townzts6196e	Hi, How have you been?zts6197e	Are you OK?zts6198e	As always, I am fine. But. there is something strange. I have encountered lizard on my walk, but they ran away as they saw me. I was surprise. I didn't noticed but I was wearing a hat made of Racoony tail. Racoony birds pecked on me so I got a little scars. Is this someone secretly gave to me?zts6199e	<pname>, you should know this. Celloin suddenly send me strange letter. Look.zts6200e	(I was impressed about what you did to Wood zombies after hearing my story about them. Celloin is pleasantly surprised about you as I thought you were just an intelligent person. hoho I will be waiting for you at the place that Sellbig promised. By Celloin. PS: I can't wait till I see the proposal event.)zts6201e	(Looks like an happy ending as it seems?)zts6202e	(Sellbig seems to have something in agony)zts6203e	What shall I do? I am not ready for Celloin's feelings. I don't recall I had fight with Wood zombies. and I am not sure what you are talking about promise..zts6204e	Cheer up!!zts6205e	What do you mean, cheer up. that is too much.zts6206e	Act3 Quest_Unknown Orezts6207e	Hi, I got a good news. Celloins said she might marrying Sellbig. I think that is great.zts6208e	But Sellbig kept sighing. I wonder what is going on.zts6209e	(Maybe she didn't say that yet)zts6210e	ah. I forgot one thing. Here is a new request. Lumberman Jack asked for help.zts6211e	Are you the adventurer of the Noscamp? Welcomezts6212e	(A young man approaches to Jack and whispers)zts6213e	oh. I met this guy a few days back, and he says he is looking for something under his boss's order. Start talking to this man. I will bring up my request when you are done with this man.zts6214e	You must be the adventurer that Jack told me about. Good to see you. My name is Rody Windsinger. What's your name?zts6215e	(Looks like he is stiff. I should be polite, though) My name is <pname>zts6216e	oh looks like a good name. Anyway, I have a small request for you.zts6217e	talk to me freelyzts6218e	I am working on a special order under the guidance of high rank people. You will be able to meet my assistant while you are working on Jack's request. His name is Erie Windsphere, and has big javelin. Try not to fight when you meet.zts6219e	I will keep that in mind.zts6220e	Thanks, now talk to Jack.zts6221e	Are you done? Now, listen to me. I am running Lumbermill in this Fir Woods. I am on 3rd generation on this mill. Nowadays, there are something strange is happening around here. Collecting lumbers are not a big deal. During my lumber work I used to enjoy watching deers. I sometimes hide those beautiful deers from the hunter, Parker. Nowadays, deers don't approach me any more and weired creatures come to me and attack. I want you to help me to have those deers come to me. I don't feel any achievement if I don't see deers any longer.zts6222e	The deers have become violent.zts6223e	what is this bell?zts6224e	('Jack Lumbermill' is carved on the bell)zts6225e	I should ask Jack.zts6226e	(Jack's eyes get wet as he touches the bell)zts6227e	This is the one that I gave to 'Merry'zts6228e	Merry?zts6229e	Yeah. One of the deers liked me. It used to like me very much.zts6230e	then you are saying that evil deers used to be normal deers?zts6231e	yes. Hey, adventurer. I have a request.zts6232e	There must be a high level evil that made deers to monsters. I want you to hunt the evil down. You may find it is difficult, but you should be able to find one while you hunt down evils around the town. Please.zts6233e	I hear strange noise. I should check it out.zts6234e	(Explains what happened at the deep inside of the woods)zts6235e	Tri Trikung used to be the woodkeeper. Can't believe he is now a monster. Anyway, now Tri Trikung is gone, so deers should comeback. Thanks. You did a great job. Ah, Rodi wants to see you. He would like to find out what he asked to you the other day.zts6236e	Have you met Erie?zts6237e	(He explained what happened when he met Erie)zts6238e	I thought it would be very difficult for her, but you helped her. Thank you so much.zts6239e	You're welcome. Anyway, about the ore that Erie. What kind of ore is this? I have never seen that.zts6240e	(Rodi frowned as if he was seriously think of something)zts6241e	I don't know. Erie gave that as a gift, so it shouldn't be too much dangerous.zts6242e	(Rodi must got something in him.. would there be any secret in the ore?) let's find out what kind of ore it is..zts6243e	My knight~!! How have you been? Ah, Is Eril OK?zts6244e	yes. Fine. But I have something to ask.zts6245e	(He showed the unknown ore)zts6246e	I got this ore as a gift. do you know what it is?zts6247e	I can feel unknown power. But I don't know as the power is too weak. I need some more ores to find out the details.zts6248e	Got it.zts6249e	Didn't the person who owned this ore tell you where she got?zts6250e	Hm. I am told it could be found from underground tunnelzts6251e	the underground tunnel is southeast side of the Fir Woods. I can't believe that is the source of ore. We will find out more details.zts6252e	This must be the place that Charlotte mentioned.zts6253e	I can't see a thing around here. Monsters nearby might have some.zts6254e	Where are they.zts6255e	Not this one.zts6256e	Where on earth can I find them.zts6257e	(He found something and runs to it)zts6258e	let's get back to Charlotte.zts6259e	Act3 Quest_Peober is hyper-risky creature?zts6260e	I have researched about the ore. The elements of the ore is similar to that of Time Warp Stone. It is very similar to the energy source of the space travel power. However, it is unstable, and energy supply is not perfect, it would be very difficult to refine.zts6261e	Hm. an ore with secret. Ah. I picked this up when I went to search ores. Take a look.zts6262e	(Charlotte screams as she saw Peober's mucus)zts6263e	Yikes. What are you doing? Errrr. it is so eerie. Gross! Get it out of my sight!zts6264e	(Charlotte hides into the room with her hair stood up)zts6265e	She hates larva's mucus. Maybe none of us have noticed. We should ask someone else.zts6266e	Don't come around me with that.zts6267e	I should try Milano town first. Bill might know about this.zts6268e	A blacksmith like me know nothing. Don't come around me with that. I might crash that with my hammer. You should ask to Sellbig.zts6269e	Sellbig..zts6270e	(Sellbig shook his head as if he doesn't know anything)zts6271e	First time to see that. The size is bulky, I wonder if there is any living creature with this.zts6272e	Shall I ask to Celloin?zts6273e	What is this?zts6274e	(Celloin looks into the mucus)zts6275e	it's a huge larva's mucuszts6276e	(Celloin's face got pale, and his eyes were shaken)zts6277e	go away, you scum.zts6278e	Hew. hm? Here comes Vellochika. I should ask himzts6279e	I don't know.zts6280e	(He went into the shop after shout)zts6281e	I don't know. I don't know.zts6282e	(No one wants to talk to me. Maybe Eril know about this)zts6283e	(Eril was about to cry as he saw the mucus)zts6284e	(Is this such a horrible one)zts6285e	I don't know about the larvae.zts6286e	(Would there be anyone knows about this. Looks like there is no one knows about this)zts6287e	Sandra might be of help as she traveled many places. And Celloin told me he would kill you if you bring that to him again.zts6288e	(I guess I am not so popular. Hew. let's stop by Sandra first)zts6289e	a huge larva? I have never seen that, of course. Where did you see? Is there any prize?zts6290e	(Like I imagined..)zts6291e	have you shown that anybody you met?zts6292e	(His mind was stung a bit)zts6293e	You showed to everybody. you scoundrel.zts6294e	(Alex called as he saw the bottle filled with Peober's mucus)zts6295e	This is it. Some time ago, a lady asked she was looking for something. She is looking for very long object called Fe.. something. I didn't know so I asked to Sandra, and she pecked on me. As far as I know, the smell is very similar to that of the lady.zts6296e	Do you know where she is now?zts6297e	yes. She went to watermill. The water mill is in Maple Woods.zts6298e	oh.. cute kid. What's up?zts6299e	(Showed the Peober's mucus)zts6300e	I came to here that you know about this.zts6301e	hm, is that so? That is called 'Phoenix Butterfly Caterpillar Garm's mucus', as known as Peober.zts6302e	Water in town once polluted because of this. Do you know anything about this?zts6303e	calm down. I will tell you everything I know. Any introduction of yourself?zts6304e	oh. Sorry. My name is <pname>zts6305e	I am Sotty. Sotty Bistander. I am running an errand of a chatterbox.zts6306e	A chatterbox..zts6307e	my boss. Don't mind my manner, as it is true. Anyway, you said you want to know about the Peober? That is a very dangerous creature. Have you seen what it is eating?zts6308e	I have seen it eating oreszts6309e	do you know about the ore?zts6310e	no.zts6311e	the ore is a part of Time warp stone. It has massive power. Peober is eating that ore to gain energy for mutation.zts6312e	are you saying mutation is dangerous?zts6313e	Like I said, The ore is a part of Time Warp Stone. The energy of the stone is like the power of the God. Imagine such power stays within a body while mutating. The energy would be used in the final stage of the mutation at once. What do you think to spill the energy at one time during the mutation?zts6314e	I don't know.zts6315e	(Sotty loudly said)zts6316e	Boom!! The explosion would take everything away in this town.zts6317e	Is that right?zts6318e	Yes. That is why I am collecting information about the Peober to avoid the danger. I need your help. I am so tired after a long trip. please help me.zts6319e	I will do anything to avoid the explosionzts6320e	First find my assistant Rect. He is also looking for Peober. I want you to help him. Can you do that for me? Rect is now at the outskirts of the Maple Woods.zts6321e	Sotty asked you to help me? You should have other things of your own.zts6322e	no. my name is Rect Lart.zts6323e	I am <pname>.zts6324e	I am a bit surprised as you didn't get hurt from Roofgain.. Ah, nevermind. I have something to ask you a favor. A few days back, I got the cast-off of a Peober, but Warret stole it. I am still tracking down on him but I got other things to do. I want you to do the job for me. the cast-off will be a key to chasing Peobers.zts6325e	OK, I will do that.zts6326e	Warret will be staying in outskirts of Maple Woods. There are similar monsters, so be careful.zts6327e	This huge cast-off must be that of Peobers. Some characters are written inside. I should bring this to Rect.zts6328e	(Rect found out strange characters inside of the cast-off)zts6329e	This is..zts6330e	What does it say?zts6331e	I can't read themzts6332e	(Rect's tone was too much assured)zts6333e	Sotty should know about this. Bring this to Sotty.zts6334e	(Rect mumbled after he hand over the cast-off)zts6335e	I thought I know every single language of this East Mile.zts6336e	(I don't believe that)zts6337e	(Sotty reads through the cast-off)zts6338e	This is made of other world's charmzts6339e	other world?zts6340e	These strange characters are charms in itself. These are for condensating the power. About this amount of charm could blow up everything around this town.zts6341e	I can't believe this..zts6342e	We should hunt down the Peober before it become a pupa.zts6343e	I don't know where it is..zts6344e	I know a charm that attracts the Peober. I can ask Rect to prepare. You collect the material for the charm. Here is the list I need.zts6345e	The first material I need is Moth flour. Peober lives in a dark place, so their eye sight is not good. So it is possible to make Moth flours to look like an ore. You could find them easily.zts6346e	now I got them. I should bring these to Sotty.zts6347e	you got them already? Wow. Then let's move on to the next one. The quicker the better, got it?zts6348e	Moth flour can't make enough shining effect like an ore, so we need sprite flour, eh? Where can I find them? Charlotte should know. She knows everything about shining stuff.zts6349e	Sprite flour? Hm. I heard of it but I am not sure where to find them. Sis, do you know where can he find?zts6350e	Maple should have some Sprite flour. Didn't you said you saw her at the Maple Woods?zts6351e	Hoho. she is in Maple Woods. got it?zts6352e	Thanks.zts6353e	Be careful the wisps that Maple recalls. It is not fatal but it hurts.zts6354e	You should explain wisp has the Sprite flour.zts6355e	he's gone alreadyzts6356e	Sis..zts6357e	I got them, too. Now to Sotty!zts6358e	Wow. Great job. You are more capable than I thought. Now move on to the next material~zts6359e	The 3rd material I need is to be used for maintaining the volume of the product. the liver of the Kelberos, the trihead evil dog? Where can I find this? Hm. there must be someone knows about this. No. there is actually only one person. I don't want to ask anymore to him.zts6360e	Oh, my, my. Who is this? The best customer I have ever had, <pname>, eh? What do you want now?zts6361e	I need the liver of the black evil dog.zts6362e	say that again? I don't hear you.zts6363e	The liver of the black evil dog!!zts6364e	Hm. the liver of the black evil dog. good. I can give you a good deal. My cut is always clean. 1 million gold. This is the best price.zts6365e	cheap? Are you kidding?zts6366e	then go somewhere else if you don't like.zts6367e	oh my god.zts6368e	(Paid the bill with anger)zts6369e	thanks much. Haha. The black evil dog is hiding deep inside. Here is the map to help you. Come to me anytime you need my help. And don't forget the money, too.zts6370e	I was almost killed. Hew..zts6371e	wow. Good job. I am so impressed.zts6372e	Now what is the next material? Let me see. To enhance the biting texture of the product, the strength of the product should be improved. To make the improvement, the horn of Deguri is ideal. Deguri Horn. Maybe Eril knows about this?zts6373e	(Asked about Deguri Horn)zts6374e	Normal Deguri horn is too weak. I think King Deguri should make the improvement.zts6375e	Where can I find King Deguri?zts6376e	it should be located in Degur Degur cliff where you have visited once.zts6377e	Never mind. What is making you such hurry?zts6378e	I will explain later. Bye.zts6379e	You are so energeticzts6380e	The Degur Degur cliff is located in north skirt of Western Mine Field. oh. He's gone already.zts6381e	Why is this pecking me this much. my body would break down.zts6382e	My.. My..zts6383e	what? Something wrong?zts6384e	no, I just, thought you might be better than Rect. Would you like to be my assistant? I could pay you good reward.zts6385e	I am an adventurer. You know.zts6386e	too bad. Roofgain must have liked you so much.zts6387e	What would be the next material..zts6388e	(To be like great-powered ore, it should contain strong core spirit. Peober is very coward in its nature, it would suspect if it doesn't sense the power. The suitable material seemed to be 'the core of brave spirit')zts6389e	I don't get it. Ur Koaren might know about the spirit.zts6390e	Hm. I am not sure.zts6391e	(Ur Koaren talks to Whiririck Colleen for a while)zts6392e	Colleen says the Kovolt Warrior's spirit should have the core spirit. In the past, they were known as warriors with brave, but now they just have madness. You will be able to find them in the cave of spirit.zts6393e	Always don't forget you are a warrior, my KangKang Koarenzts6394e	hew.. Kovolt's face is just same as ghosts.zts6395e	This is what you get? Good work. Didn't you afraid? I thought they were scary.zts6396e	Well, I was able to handle them.zts6397e	hm.. I was told the baby has human face with brave warrior's spirit. Maybe that's true.zts6398e	No. Never.zts6399e	Guess it was a useless information. It was with high cost.zts6400e	Who did you get that wrong information from?zts6401e	hm. It was a lady wearing glasses. She said the fare money is mandatory.zts6402e	Hm. Poor Sandrazts6403e	Now we are two sorcery elements away from the final. Where did I put the sixth element description.zts6404e	(If it has a spiritual core, then change the spiritual core into similar power as the ore with similar smell. Golden maple leaf will help the transformation process. Human cannot smell the Golden maple leaf, so it would be difficult to find.zts6405e	if one can't smell the leaf, Alex should know how to find it.zts6406e	Golden Maple leaf's smell is hard to find, and very subtle. It doesn't feel like a wood, but like soil.zts6407e	I can't distinguish the scent.zts6408e	It's hard to explain. Maples should have some golden Maple leaves. They live on earth.zts6409e	Maples are located in Maple Woods. Maple fairy has the Golden Maple leaves. Where is it.zts6410e	Chop, Chop, come on!!zts6411e	now only one left. I should bring this to Sotty first.zts6412e	How did you get this?zts6413e	got it.. (Where in the world the seventh element is..)zts6414e	(Turns around as the sound calling someone heard)zts6415e	Who are you looking for?zts6416e	(Rodie might know about the seventh sorcer element)zts6417e	(Explains about the sorcer element, requested by Sotty)zts6418e	Oh my.. you were deceived by themzts6419e	Deceived?zts6420e	Peober is not a dangerous creature. That is not a exploding creature, but a creature under the oath of nesting Latheore, the king of the angels. In fact, the other side is Evil.zts6421e	what? That's nonsense. They were not like what I know about Evils. They were look like humans.zts6422e	High rank evils can change their shapes easily, not like the low rank evils. I am sure they have transformed just to deceive you.zts6423e	I don't believe this..zts6424e	I am not sure what the demons are up to, but I can say we are trying very hard to protect ourselves from their invasion. Our goal is to resurrect Latheore the king of angel, so demons can never think about invading this town. I want <pname> also to be with us.zts6425e	I can't believe this. What are you then?zts6426e	I am an dispatched angel from Mystic Heaven. My name is Rodisiciel Steward, the eighth priest of the King of Angelzts6427e	were you then hiding yourself as well?zts6428e	I had no choice as my priority was to guard the world's peace. If you still don't believe me, Ask Erie as she knows well about the sorcer Demon was teaching - maybe then you would understand me.zts6429e	(Rodie said assertively)zts6430e	Angel is only for the justice. Erie would prove that.zts6431e	good. I would stand by Angels then.zts6432e	(As Sotty saw the final sorcer material, she was delighted)zts6433e	Thank you so much. You are a real adventurer of Noscamp. Now I am relieved. Now you go to Rect with these elements. He is forming a Feng-Sui positions to make the sorcer. Remember the place you met Rect? He is there.zts6434e	Act3 Quest_Where is the truth?zts6435e	There must be a misunderstandingzts6436e	How come you didn't tell me you are a Demon?zts6437e	Demons are known to be absolute to you guys. You betrayed me after you listening Angels only?zts6438e	that was..zts6439e	That's natural. That is why I didn't tell you who I am. Let me introduce myself one more time. I am Rectruth Lightelusion. Socanty's direct assistant, who is the tracker of Magic Surcan, the 5th self of Hellord.zts6440e	then you are my enemy?zts6441e	no. Demons following Surcan are rather friendly. Those who tried to resurrect Fernon tree were following other demonszts6442e	How can I believe you are not my enemy?zts6443e	then how can you believe angels are on your side? Just because they are angels? Very funny.zts6444e	Look. They used monsters to get rid of you and me. Just to find out about me. Peober would not explode when it hatches? You believe that?zts6445e	(Rect throws something look like the ore that Peober ate, then there was an explosion)zts6446e	this small piece make such explosion - how come you believe Peober would not believe it would not explode? Peober eats orezts6447e	that was..zts6448e	They want to recall the King of Angel to Eastmile. Why this town? Don't you wonder? They could do it in Mystic Heaven, which is their own.zts6449e	That is because there are Demons around here.zts6450e	no. We came here to hold them after they started their movement. I am sure they have tried to resurrect the King of Angel in Mystic Town. They failed and there was an catastrophe in their town, so they chose this place to recall the King of Angel. That's how they could save their town and make a war with Hellord.zts6451e	Are you saying this place is going to be an war place?zts6452e	now you started to understand. I don't want a war so I need your help.zts6453e	how can I believe you?zts6454e	As you know well about the Genesis, the ancient war between Mystic Heaven and Hellord ended by Ginas and Elenia. When Ginas tried to eliminate Mystic Heaven and Hellord, Elenia blocked Ginas. That was the beginning of the current situation. Hellord has so many selves and each of them has different thoughts. some of them want peace, and some of them want a war. We are the selves who want the peace. If the King of Angel wakes up from here, the balance of the power would be broken and Erenia can't block Ginas any longer. At the end of the day..as you could see, things would move faster.zts6455e	The destroyal of the world.zts6456e	(Rect nodded his head)zts6457e	But, I can't believe either you or Angelszts6458e	I am not asking you to believe me. You will have to investigate and choose which side you would believe. The sorcer to attract Peober is failed anyway. The only resort we have now is to track down to where it is now. Peober ate enough ore to become a pupa. It would be now looking for a place to be a pupa. probably inside of an old wood.. you find it out yourself.zts6459e	(Who is telling me the truth? I can't believe Demons nor Angels. I need to do the thorough investigation.. then I will be able to find the truth.)zts6460e	The old wood is located at the southeast of the Maple Woods. It would not be so difficult to find.zts6461e	This is the place Rect mentioned.zts6462e	I can't believe this huge space in underground..zts6463e	This place also has some traces the same one when I found Peober. I can't see the details. Monsters are hindering me.zts6464e	This is the end of the trace. What the..? I hear sounds. Let's go to there.zts6465e	(Erie approaches when hiding away from Angles)zts6466e	Why are you here? You look injured. Let me see the wounds.zts6467e	Leave me alone.zts6468e	I said I was going to help you. In return, you should also help me.zts6469e	then you guys put my life at stake for twice?zts6470e	I don't know what you are sayingzts6471e	Don't lie to me. You guys changed the sorcer material and recalled the ghost, and attacked me when I was investigating this place. This wounds are the proof that your colleagues attacked me. How can I believe you are not my enemy with these? I can't believe you.zts6472e	(Erie started to cry as she dropped her spear)zts6473e	I never lied to you. Sob. sob. Never. There is no way I would hurt a righteous person like you. You helped me so much. I am going to support you more than I got from you.. cryzts6474e	OK, OK, stop cryingzts6475e	now you believe me?zts6476e	OK. For the time beingzts6477e	let me take care of the woundszts6478e	(The wounds got healed as Erie's palm was shining)zts6479e	I am looking for the Peober. Do you know where it is now?zts6480e	(Erie seemed hesitating)zts6481e	I need to find out who is telling me the truth. So I need to find out what kind of creature the Peober is with my eyes.zts6482e	I feel like something is wrong. It can't be possible there are so many angels other than me. The only angels who supposed to investigate this place is Rodie and myself. You are saying there are other angels. I also want to know the truth. Let me go with you.zts6483e	Peober's pupa must be at the Cellilusha. That is what I heard from Rodie.zts6484e	The Bridge..zts6485e	is disconnected.zts6486e	now what shall we do?zts6487e	(Erie was contemplating and clapped her hands)zts6488e	I think there is a underground pathway to Cellilushazts6489e	really?zts6490e	I am pretty sure. Trust me.zts6491e	Erie.. are you sure this is the right way?zts6492e	Hm. I am not sure.zts6493e	you told me you know the gate to the underground pathway.zts6494e	I thought this place is the one.. but it seems it is not..zts6495e	let's check that place.zts6496e	(Sigh) Yes.zts6497e	hm.. strange.. ,zts6498e	there must be the underground pathway over there. Let's get rid of the monsters first.zts6499e	yup.zts6500e	nothing here.zts6501e	eh? It can't be.zts6502e	let's go that way this time.zts6503e	Yuppy doopy~zts6504e	By all means, I don't think this is the place.zts6505e	I am pretty sure. I am sure the gate is right next to the monster in front of you.zts6506e	I am sorry.zts6507e	Not this place, either.zts6508e	I don't think this is the place.zts6509e	Even if it is, they seems not so friendlyzts6510e	Please, give me a break!!zts6511e	This is 12th time already. I am giving up.zts6512e	This time seems right a little. Don't you think?zts6513e	I have already gave upzts6514e	hey, look, right there. There is the gate!zts6515e	I am not expecting a bit.zts6516e	hey! I found the gate~zts6517e	that's right. It is the gate to the underground tunnel!!zts6518e	eh, hem.zts6519e	Angel's fortune telling is always right.zts6520e	are you saying they are right in terms of probability?zts6521e	hehe, I am sorry.zts6522e	I don't want anything from them, like I said.zts6523e	Finally, we made it. Hew.zts6524e	(They heard many people's moving sound)zts6525e	somebody is approachingzts6526e	this way.zts6527e	If Kr Koaren found the Pearl of Dusk, he should have gave it to Charlotteszts6528e	the Pearl of Dusk? No. Kr Koaren and Kenel didn't come here yet.zts6529e	really. I need the pearl of Dusk..zts6530e	If you need the peal, it seems you need to seal something?zts6531e	(He explained what have happened to Charlottezts6532e	I am also studying a way to seal the Permon Wood with that pearl. That was why I asked you. Anyway, we need to find the resolution, I will try to find Kr Koaren's location.zts6533e	Possible?zts6534e	Catsy's crystal never lies.zts6535e	(It should be better than that of Angels..)zts6536e	(Charlotte told where Kenel is with Crystal)zts6537e	How can I get there?zts6538e	I am not sure how to get to Mt. Krem, too. Wouldn't Hwiririk Colleen knows about Mt. Krem?zts6539e	Welcome. The fairy of the wind told me you would stop by. What can I do for you?zts6540e	(Said about what the Crystal said, to Colleen)zts6541e	That's not an easy place to reach. It would take more than a few days even if you depart right now.zts6542e	I don't have enough time. I need to meet Kr Koaren.zts6543e	Fairy's Guidance.. maybe it's time to use the forgotten sorcer.zts6544e	Ancient forgotten sorcer?zts6545e	it is so called 'star, wind: to be near you'. It has been secretly succeeded within our family generations. This sorcer has similar function with Time Warp stone, so I need same elements. I never thought of using it, I can't help but I need ask you to get them for me.zts6546e	Look carefully the paper I gave you.zts6547e	What's next?zts6548e	now I need the last one.zts6549e	good job. Thanks. Now I am beginning 'star, wind: to be near you' right here. Make your mind lucid.zts6550e	(Colleen mumbles the sorcer)zts6551e	Beautiful lights of star, fancy dance of the wind. They move freely where ever they want to go. Please share the power whomever loves the fairy of the freedom.zts6552e	(As the sorcery works, light covers everything)zts6553e	Explains Kr Koaren why the Pearl of Dusk is required.zts6554e	I believe you as you said so. Be careful.zts6555e	(Finally, I need help from Erie and Rect.)zts6556e	Act3 Quest_the choice of Erie and Rectzts6557e	(He showed the pearl of the dusk to Erie, and explained the way to prevent Peober hatching)zts6558e	I need your help.zts6559e	If I help you, I would become a betrayer.zts6560e	Where is your justice?zts6561e	my justice?zts6562e	If the King of Angel, Latheore wakes up, there would be massive explosion and that creature would be recalled to this world. Then the whole world would become a battle field between Demon and Angel. Are you going to just sit and watch without doing nothing?zts6563e	no. never.. I just..zts6564e	I know you are a person to think that life is valuable, and don't want a war. What Rodie is doing is to start a war. A war that never ends.zts6565e	However, I don't think I could shake hands with Demons. They are Demons, the selves of Evil minds. I can't believe they are telling the truth.zts6566e	you know already what is the truth - if Latheore wakes up, there would be gigantic energy generation. You also know what the ore is. Most of all, you know who Rodie really is.zts6567e	I believe your justice is love. I know your justice is something like, preventing the war, helping someone else. Rodie is addicted with his desire to the power and lost his minds. We need someone to keep him away. You are the only one who can do this. please.zts6568e	(Erie contemplated for a while, then answered)zts6569e	OK. The most important thing is the Elloin's balance and the precious lives.zts6570e	(Now I need to talk to Rect)zts6571e	hm.. Are you going to ask help to Rect?zts6572e	of course.zts6573e	hm..zts6574e	I can't do this without his help.zts6575e	I was expecting you. You don't have to tell everything. You want me to help you to block Latheore's awakening.zts6576e	There is nothing in Hellord, where I used to stay. It has greed and violence only. I had to fight just to survive.zts6577e	of course. Life itself has its own meaning.zts6578e	That's very angel.zts6579e	what? Are you playing with me?zts6580e	no. I respect you. <pname>. You know where to go?zts6581e	Cellilusha.zts6582e	Hurry up. Latheore's resurrection is close.zts6583e	(A number of angels are approaching from the distancezts6584e	don't worry, I will cover your back.zts6585e	Thanks, Rect. Erie, let's go.zts6586e	Angel, be strong. You just turned around your back to your Angels.zts6587e	I know. And my name is Erie.zts6588e	got that. Erie, let's go!!zts6589e	I can't fight against all of them. We will make an exit in the middle of the herd.zts6590e	Sorry. Sisters. This is for the bigger Good. Forgive me.zts6591e	This is so big..zts6592e	This is the pupa of the Peober. Hatching is close.zts6593e	we need to stop it. Let's hurry.zts6594e	let's go.zts6595e	Stop. You doomed people. Receive the punishment of the King of Angel.zts6596e	Emptiness is next to you. Drown yourself to the sea of Emptiness. You empty peoplezts6597e	The king of Angel would get angry.zts6598e	I am not fear of his anger.zts6599e	we have reached about the middle point. Let's move this way.zts6600e	That way is to upper side. Don't you think this way would be better?zts6601e	<pname>, you decide.zts6602e	(Without hesitation) Rect's side!zts6603e	not funny.zts6604e	Listen to me. Your justice is not right justice. That is twisted. No justice justifies killing lives. It should be rather called evil. You are making Evil's way. You listen to me.zts6605e	Our justice is given by Latherore. Lives are valuable depending on his order.zts6606e	(Rect smashes an Angel approaching Erie from the back)zts6607e	Don't hesitate, otherwise you will be killed.zts6608e	I know.. but..zts6609e	trust what's inside of you.zts6610e	This way is right this time.zts6611e	I don't think that is the right way..zts6612e	we don't have definitive end. Let's go.zts6613e	the number of angels are getting bigger.zts6614e	Hm. I don't think that is too much. You take the front and we will make an exit path.zts6615e	so sorry.zts6616e	I will be at the front next time.zts6617e	strange.zts6618e	It looks like they are not the real forces.zts6619e	It can't be. These are Mystic knights.zts6620e	what is mystic knight?zts6621e	They are the militia of god spellers. They are also called representative of Latheore. They always stand at the frontline of the war.zts6622e	that means..zts6623e	Maybe they are bringing us to a certain place.zts6624e	Should we be more careful before we move?zts6625e	no we are running out of time. We need to fight against them anyhow.zts6626e	we are now nearest position of the pupa.zts6627e	..zts6628e	Rect.zts6629e	no let's go.zts6630e	(Something must be wrong. There is no guards)zts6631e	(All of their bodies are covered with light. But nothing can be seen)zts6632e	I couldn't save anyone. kaaaarrr~zts6633e	no. that is not true. You did your best.zts6634e	don't be sad. This is our choice. I was able to save the justice because of you, my justice.zts6635e	Now this is our part to carry on. Please look at us.zts6636e	what are you going to to?zts6637e	Lathore.. I am going to dilute the power of resurrection via Angelloan's heritage.zts6638e	what would be happening to you then?zts6639e	we would become not ourselves any more.zts6640e	Thanks. I think I found the meaning of my life.zts6641e	my hometown was Space of Emptiness. This place has so much livelihood. I love this place. And I loved more because I had you.zts6642e	Adios Amigo.zts6643e	Be safe.zts6644e	No!!zts6645e	(Fainting slowly)zts6646e	Act3 TimeSpace 64zts6647e	the inside of Fastone lab was filled with dark power. What are they expecting me to investigate?zts6648e	still coming?! Danger.zts6649e	I need to tell people about this.. I need to put the picture of this place into the report.zts6650e	(Hesitating for a while)zts6651e	I am Kang Kang Koaren.zts6652e	(Giggling sound was heard. But negligible as the sound was so small)zts6653e	I finished the investigation and need to find out the exit. There is no exit. Where should I go?zts6654e	it's endless. I think I am going crazy.zts6655e	(Green smoke showed up and it started to cover the body)zts6656e	What is this? I am getting sleepy. I need to be awake..zts6657e	(He saw a big shadow was approaching and blacked out)zts6658e	Act3 TimeSpace 65zts6659e	it's so difficult to breath due to the poison fog.zts6660e	it stinks. I hate this smell. It's smell from the dead.zts6661e	would there be any survivor?zts6662e	I don't think so. No one would have survived.zts6663e	Hm. the same poison. Hold your breath.zts6664e	would the poison lost your mind?zts6665e	(Alex nodded)zts6666e	(Mysterious note)zts6667e	The guardian of the lab stand on he lowest level to fight against invaders. There must be something important that they want to protect.zts6668e	Act3 TimeSpace 66zts6669e	Charlotte, Patty!zts6670e	wow, Knight. Good to see you again. Did you miss me, too? Charlotte missed you very much.zts6671e	I came here as I heard you left the Koaren town. Why did you leave?zts6672e	that was.. bad foods, no manners on the table, and bad smells. The bed was horrible as well. I just can't put up with themzts6673e	Sis..zts6674e	(Charlotte couldn't look into the eyes, turning her head around)zts6675e	Are you punishing yourself in a way as you were not able to seal the Fernon Wood?zts6676e	(Charlotte slightly nodded)zts6677e	huhu. Catsies are cowards.zts6678e	Kenel, Stop.zts6679e	As you wish, Master.zts6680e	Don't take wrong with what Kenel said, Catsies. Listen. We Kovolts, including myself, are appreciating you for your helping us. We don't think you are road hogging. If you are leaving the town because you feel somehow guilty, then we can't let you go. If you think that is the problem, then I suggest you that we could find the key to seal the wood togetherzts6681e	Master Kr Koaren.zts6682e	Something you have is calling for Monsterszts6683e	(The Radal's ring..?)zts6684e	we will talk later after we destroy monsterszts6685e	hee~what is that with dark power? I wonder what that could be.zts6686e	(Explains how he got the Radal's ring)zts6687e	you always do something dangerous.zts6688e	huhu. 'KangKang is more brave than any other warriors.zts6689e	what? 'Kang Kang'?zts6690e	You don't know Kang Kang.zts6691e	(Player intervenes with his face flushed)zts6692e	Anyway, This caused so many people's sacrifice. Therefore, I need your help.zts6693e	(Charlotte closely looked into the Radal's Ring. Then she clapped as if she remembered something)zts6694e	I want to have something called the Pearl of Dusk. If you get me that, I will go with you. Got it?zts6695e	got it. I will bring it.zts6696e	Act3 Time Space 67zts6697e	Is this the place where thousand-year-old clam is?zts6698e	yes.zts6699e	so many monsters here.zts6700e	The big clam over there seems the thousand-year-old clamzts6701e	thanks. As you release the seal I could taste fresh water for a long time. I can't pay you back enough. Let me do something for you.zts6702e	your highness. We need your Pearl of the Dusk.zts6703e	OK.zts6704e	(The thousand-year-old clam gently spits out the Pearl of Dusk)zts6705e	This is my lifetime master piece. Hope you use it for the good. Thanks for saving me.zts6706e	kk. The glitter. That's mine. Give me that.zts6707e	you villain. I will not tolerate.zts6708e	(Kenel attacked Crisos but it ran away with giggle)zts6709e	If I don't bring that, Catsies will only joke on me. It is a grace to Warrior. Koarens and myself will get it back.zts6710e	me, too.zts6711e	no. you calm down the Catsies. This is a present for the Catsies. Give this to them, please.zts6712e	Act3 Time Space 68zts6713e	Ahhhhhhh!! Wh.. what is this? A worm?zts6714e	(The worm budged a little, and crawled away fast)zts6715e	I have never seen such big worm. What would that be?zts6716e	Act3 Time Space 69zts6717e	Something is approaching. Watch out.zts6718e	Tri Kung. Tri Kung. Tri Kung.zts6719e	this sound. Can it be Trikung Trikung? Are these made deers monsters?zts6720e	(Got Golden Feather after defeating Trikung Trikung)zts6721e	well..zts6722e	what?zts6723e	That is very precious to me. I would like it back.zts6724e	here you go.zts6725e	(Hands over the Golden Feather)zts6726e	Thank you. Thank you so much. My name is Erie Windspear. Call me Erie. Yikes.zts6727e	(Erie fell down after tripping on something)zts6728e	ouch. It hurts.zts6729e	this happens to me from time to time. I am OK. Yikes.zts6730e	(Fell down again)zts6731e	(From time to time? That must hurt) By the way, what is that pole over there? Looks like it is moving a little.zts6732e	Pole. No that is not. This is my family's treasure called 'Slade Oxtern'. This spear is from my great great great.zts6733e	(Explains about the family treasure for a long time)zts6734e	(So.. this is a spear? Too big for a spear) is this heavy?zts6735e	it was heavy when I first picked up, but now it's ok to handle for me. Weights? Probably heavier than that wood.zts6736e	(Erie pointed a large wood)zts6737e	Heavier than that wood? (Now I call it monster power.)zts6738e	Hm. I got a Feather from you, so I would like to pay you back. What would be suitable?zts6739e	(Erie picked up a stone and handed out)zts6740e	This is I picked up from the underground tunnel over there.. I heard people around here like shining stone. I will give you this.zts6741e	Thanks for the offer but. are you sure?zts6742e	sure. Now I should be leaving as I am on my duty.zts6743e	(Erie goes away with Slade Oxtern on her hands)zts6744e	Act3 Time Space 70zts6745e	(After finding the ore)zts6746e	there it is.zts6747e	(Suddenly a worm appeared and ate up the ore)zts6748e	that thing ate the ore?zts6749e	(The worm noticed the player and rapidly ran away)zts6750e	hew.. I lost himzts6751e	Erie?zts6752e	who is this?zts6753e	I gave you the Golden feather the other day.zts6754e	Ah. that kind adventurer. I was so busy so I didn't remember you.. hehe I am so sorry.zts6755e	That worm.zts6756e	I am on a very important duty now, so I will catch you up later.zts6757e	Hey..zts6758e	(Erie disappeared quickly)zts6759e	(Found mucus path where the worm crawled)zts6760e	Maybe there is some kind of relationship with the worm and the ore.zts6761e	Act3 Time Space 71zts6762e	This place is known to be where black magic dogs live. Looks like quieter than I thought.zts6763e	Is there really a black magic dog? I might have spend my money in vainzts6764e	only stray dogs..zts6765e	Krrrng. krrrrr.zts6766e	I found it.zts6767e	Act3 Time Space 72zts6768e	This place is near from Erie, I hear rattling sound. Somebody must be having a war.zts6769e	what is the use of that spear. Bring on! Your spear is crying!zts6770e	there is no one who could avoid my Slade Oxternzts6771e	no. you can't not win over mezts6772e	here we go. This time is real. I am going to destroy your weapon. It would end this fight.zts6773e	funny.zts6774e	(The Demon duck with simple move, and counter attacked.zts6775e	Yikes.zts6776e	(Demon attacks again as Erie fell down)zts6777e	Gottcha. You can not run away from them.zts6778e	(Dangerous) Stop!zts6779e	(Intervenes between Erie and Demon)zts6780e	You are?zts6781e	I will not let you attack again.zts6782e	I can't help it.zts6783e	(Demon went away)zts6784e	Don't run away. Stop. ooh.zts6785e	carefulzts6786e	I have to chase the Demon nonetheless. They are blocking our sacred duties.zts6787e	but you can't fight with that wounds. Relax first.zts6788e	But.zts6789e	listen to me.zts6790e	(After treating Erie)zts6791e	How come Demon attacks you?zts6792e	I heard you are Angel from Rodiezts6793e	I didn't want to speak up that I was an Angelzts6794e	why?zts6795e	I didn't want you to be involved in this war. You are a brave man. You probably volunteered to help me even if I said no.zts6796e	I can't stop this as long as I am aware.zts6797e	this is it.zts6798e	(Erie showed the 7th sorcer element)zts6799e	you were attacked because of this?zts6800e	yes. This is one of the element that Demons use to attract Peobers. They are trying to get rid of Peober, so that the King of Angel cannot resurrect.zts6801e	why are they trying to resurrect the Angel King?zts6802e	To win the war against Demons. I heard you helped to avoid the resurrection of the Fernon Wood. They want this place. They were triggering war all the time to use this place as their base camp. The only way to end the war is to resurrect Latheore, the King of Angelzts6803e	I heard there will be a massive explosion when the King of Angel resurrects. Is this true?zts6804e	No that is not true. The King of Angel always emphasized the value of lives. And I agree with him.zts6805e	(The adventurer decided to help her, and told her about how he started to collect elements according to Rect's requestzts6806e	Thanks for telling me the truth. This is an element that Rodie gave me. It looks like the bait to attract Peober, but it has different effectszts6807e	different effects?zts6808e	if Demons use this to call a sorcer, you will found out their identity. And you can hold them down. Give this to them.zts6809e	Act3 Time Space 73zts6810e	Rect, here is the element you asked.zts6811e	Thank you.zts6812e	(Rect started to make up magic Feng Sui positions using elements)zts6813e	Strange. no reaction is happening..zts6814e	what is this? Are you sure you brought all the things on the note?zts6815e	well..zts6816e	Are you saying someone has replaced with something else? Tell me the truth now.zts6817e	(Told the story to Rect)zts6818e	Darn. they deceived you.zts6819e	no that's not possible. They are angels. You are a Demonzts6820e	so you think I am your enemy?zts6821e	Demons had unsealed the Fernon Wood, generate confusion, and start a war with Kovolts and Human.zts6822e	oh, my.. We need to talk more after we take care of these monster. It seems they are not friendly to you, eitherzts6823e	Aren't they recalled by you, to get rid of me?zts6824e	I did my sorcer with what you brought to me. These monsters came from nowhere. These are trying to kill you as well.zts6825e	Act3 Time Space 74zts6826e	The man is still alive?zts6827e	I wonder if Erie passed on the material correctly.zts6828e	What are you saying?zts6829e	It would have a lot easier for you if you dead along with Demons.. You are not helpful for carrying on our duties. This place is going to be cleaned up while Latheore is resurrected. It would not be so bad to die earlier than that.zts6830e	then is it true that the Peober would explode as it hatches?zts6831e	that is unavoidable sacrifice we would have to pay. We need scapegoat anyway for the resurrection.zts6832e	How on earth do you think like this? We are not just scapegoats. Are you saying that is what Angels call Love?zts6833e	Everything is for justice. We believe that is the minimal sacrificezts6834e	I can't forgive you ever.zts6835e	Ah. I am not sure who is telling the truth. I need to find out the truth. so confusingzts6836e	Act3 Time Space 75zts6837e	here. This is the pathway to the inside of Cellilushazts6838e	Amazingly bigzts6839e	So is Peoberzts6840e	You cannot approach any closer now.zts6841e	(Erie pretended surprised as she saw the angel)zts6842e	How come you guys are in Eastmile?zts6843e	Of course we are under the order of Rodie.zts6844e	You are the member of militia. If you are here, then Hellord would also increase their militia. If that happens it would only ignite the war and it is going to be inevitable war. Please return to Mystic Heavenzts6845e	The resurrection of the Latheore, the King of Angel is near, which we were so longing for. You also should be next to Rodie, sister.zts6846e	this adventurer would also be with you. Rodie would have to prove that Latheore's resurrection is safe.zts6847e	That man can't go to Cellilusha. I know he is following Demons' directions already.zts6848e	no that is not true. He help us a lot. We need to convince him that we are not his enemy.zts6849e	Erie. Wake up. This place is becoming a ruin place. You need to move to Cellilusha with us now.zts6850e	I. I can't believe that. There are so many lives living here. Here is a beautiful place filled with the Goddess' blessings. Is this place becoming a ruin? Due to the resurrection of Latheore? I can't believe that.zts6851e	That is all for Mystic heaven and to punish our enemy.zts6852e	You. Is that what you think of this place, is that it?zts6853e	you adventurers are very annoying. I am afraid I would have to kill you now otherwise there might be some other consequences.zts6854e	(The leader of Angels gave sign, and the attack was started)zts6855e	Is this inevitable fight.zts6856e	(Angels attack player)zts6857e	Die.zts6858e	oook.zts6859e	(Erie blocked Angel's fatal attack with her huge spear)zts6860e	Erie, are you betraying us?zts6861e	This is not right. You are trying to get rid of so many lives and this man who helped us.. I can't believe this. Stop this.zts6862e	Erie, you are not an guardian leader of Rodisidiel anymore. I am going to report directly to Rodisidiel. Troops, kill Erikiriel and the opponents.zts6863e	(The number of Angels kept increasing, and it became cumbersome for the two. Then somebody appeared.)zts6864e	I knew this is what Angels would do.zts6865e	Demons. Erie, are you such corrupted so that ally with Demons now?zts6866e	no. never.zts6867e	Angels, your hypocrisy is about to end. Die now.zts6868e	Kyaaaaaaa.zts6869e	Stop.zts6870e	(Erie attacked Rect)zts6871e	Hey. Are you trying to help someone trying to kill you?zts6872e	There must be some kind of misunderstanding. They are not that type of tribeszts6873e	what misunderstanding? These Angels were trying to kill the adventurer and you. You would be dead by now if I didn't helped you. Am I wrong?zts6874e	but.. but..zts6875e	look around you. I am not your enemy, but your friend.zts6876e	No. it is not. My enemy is Demons. You killed my family in Mystic Heaven. You Demons..zts6877e	what are you talking about?zts6878e	(Erie disappeared without further talking)zts6879e	We are not allowed to go to Mystic Heaven after the ancient war.zts6880e	(Rect mumbled then disappeared)zts6881e	What happened?zts6882e	Hey kid. What are you thinking about? Were you think of me?zts6883e	Sotty?zts6884e	Hey that is not very funny!! You should call me 'honey' Pooozts6885e	Stop being naughtyzts6886e	hm..? Oh right. Where is Rect? He always runs away from me. Roof Gain always got bored when Rect is not around.zts6887e	Rect left after he fought with Erie. By the way, I need to find a way to prevent the explosion.. I don't know where to go first, and how to get there.zts6888e	oh, I am pretty well known to this place. Wanna help?zts6889e	can you please?zts6890e	sure. But under one condition. You need to spend some time with Roof Gain instead of Rect.zts6891e	Who is Roof Gain?zts6892e	my whip.zts6893e	you are too young.. hm. Just kidding. Now. Let's go to Cellilushazts6894e	There is Rodie.zts6895e	That man.zts6896e	do you know him?zts6897e	he is a scumzts6898e	I don't like him. Look at him. Kelbes like us wouldn't wear such clothings. He might change his cloths if his cloth gets a little dust.zts6899e	(Really, he changed his coat as it gets a little bit of dust)zts6900e	Really.zts6901e	I can't hear what he is saying. I should get closer to himzts6902e	if you get closer, he would find out. Let me make you to hearzts6903e	how long time do we have until Latheore's resurrection?zts6904e	a few more steps left. I think they are now at the final stage.zts6905e	I see. Ah. Do you know how to prevent Latheore's recall?zts6906e	Sure I know. The sorcer is 'Scream is heard everywhere like a song, emptiness is whipping us. Nihility is ubiquitous decadent spirits covering the world. Hellord's mind is same as mine, My power comes from him', right? Its words are so eerie. And also I need the Pearl of Dusk, more than 999 year old.zts6907e	right. Is there anyone knows about this other than you?zts6908e	no, none that I know of. Rodisidiel ordered me to keep it to myself only.zts6909e	good.zts6910e	(Rodie stabbed the Angel with the sword)zts6911e	Kuuuuk. Kak. Why..?zts6912e	for the 'if'. God will bless you as you are being sacrificed for the resurrection of Latheore.zts6913e	Ro.. Rodie. you.zts6914e	I thought she is beautiful just like the name. but I don't like as I thought at first. Even Demons don't kill their subordinates - they are the other selves.zts6915e	Rodie. you.zts6916e	Now that you know how to prevent the resurrection of Latheore, what you gonna do now?zts6917e	I will prevent it of course. I need to find the Pearl of the Dusk first.zts6918e	wanna help?zts6919e	tell me any time you need my help. I will be waiting.zts6920e	Act3 Time Space 76zts6921e	Kr Koaren, I came here to help you.zts6922e	Welcomezts6923e	Kang Kang Koaren has come. We will take care of evil Crisos.zts6924e	(Please that notations.)zts6925e	Calm down. Crisos is not an easy piece of cake.zts6926e	Act3 Time Space 77zts6927e	Punish the betrayers. Don't get into my way you Demonszts6928e	You are the betrayer - you have betrayed your belief and honorzts6929e	shut up.zts6930e	now you feel the fear?zts6931e	Angels are noble. You don't have the right to judge us.zts6932e	then you will have to feel yourself.zts6933e	Uneducated children of Erenia. You welcome the great Latherore's resurrection.zts6934e	You are not angels anymore. I can't forgive you for being such disrespect to liveszts6935e	I wanted the Latheore's resurrection, but this is wrong. This place I love here would become a ruin if he resurrects.zts6936e	Erie. It's never too late. Accept disposition of Rodie. And sing for the Latheore's resurrection.zts6937e	I promised. I would follow to protect living things. I am standing by my own belief.zts6938e	you are corrupted. I can't tolerate you any morezts6939e	the number is keep increasing. If we fail here, we will never be able to prevent the resurrection. Hang on.zts6940e	ah.. ah.. My justice will not go away. Don't worry.zts6941e	This can not take away what I love. Out of my way you angels!!zts6942e	well. Good job. The team would take care of others.zts6943e	Sotty!zts6944e	Thanks for believing in me, honey.zts6945e	Honey?zts6946e	Are you shy? I thought we are more. I am disappointed.zts6947e	really?zts6948e	no way!! There is nothingzts6949e	Soganti, then please take care of the rest.zts6950e	I am catching you up soon. Wait up for me there.zts6951e	hurry up. Let's gozts6952e	Act3 Time Space 78zts6953e	Now we are at the center of the pupa. I am going to use the sorcerzts6954e	hm..zts6955e	anything you want to say?zts6956e	strange. We have arrived here but we didn't bump into Rodi. He must have blocked us way before.zts6957e	maybe he is too much charged with my colleagues. Maybe you are worrying too much.zts6958e	I am calling the sorcer now.zts6959e	(Rect put his hand on the pupa and called sorcer)zts6960e	Scream is heard everywhere like a song, emptiness is whipping us. Nihility is ubiquitous decadent spirits covering the world. Hellord's mind is same as mine, My power comes from himzts6961e	(Dark fog wrapped around Rect's body, then drafted away into pupa)zts6962e	what happened?zts6963e	(As approaching Rect to wake him up, someone's voice was heard)zts6964e	hahaha. You were just framed, Erie and the adventurer.zts6965e	Rodie.zts6966e	I didn't mean, but our process has been a lot faster than we expected due to Erie. We really appreciate to you.zts6967e	what are you talking about?zts6968e	We are so lucky to have the adventurer, as you brought him into this. Your naiveness made the adventurer to be devoted. The final result was outstanding.zts6969e	are you saying you used me?zts6970e	yes. The only one thing we are short of on the resurrection of the Latheore is the body. His soul was injected via Angelloan's heritage but it was almost impossible to form a body.zts6971e	then you planned all of this even killing your subordinate to use me, knowing I was listening to you from distance?zts6972e	How could you kill them?zts6973e	That is for the justice. Sacrifice is inevitable to realize the resurrection of the Latheore.zts6974e	you are saying Latheore is going to be resurrected upon other creature's death? How could you call yourself an Angel?zts6975e	Everything is for the resurrection of the Latheore.zts6976e	hm.. it is obvious then you have done the similar thing in the past. You scum. Have you tried to resurrect Latheore at the Mystic Heaven?zts6977e	I wonder how a dirty Demon like you know about that. Yes I did that, too. I got my lessons from that event and there will be no mistake this time.zts6978e	Then. you killed my family?zts6979e	Unfortunately, as a result.. yeszts6980e	I believed in you. I trusted you.. Slade Oxtern!zts6981e	(Erie attacked Rodie with rage. But she got damage from Rodie.)zts6982e	You are now annoying me. Go away.zts6983e	are you facing me with such pathetic skill?zts6984e	I will pay.. you.. back.zts6985e	well. The Latheore's resurrection will be built on the body of the Demon.zts6986e	(Tries to save Rect by ramming on the pupa)zts6987e	I can't let it happen like this. There must be another way.zts6988e	that's useless, stop it.zts6989e	(He fell down after the Rodie's attack, but he stood up and approached Rect again)zts6990e	whatever you say.. I can't just leave my friend.zts6991e	it's too dangerous. Run. He is way more stronger than you.zts6992e	no I can't run like this.zts6993e	(Rodie attacks)zts6994e	how come you are so tough under my attacks?zts6995e	(Rodie was about to make final attack, then suddenly, black flash appeared from nowhere)zts6996e	Stop. Rodisidiel. Do not touch the kid any more.zts6997e	oh.. Lady Sogantti. I was expecting you.zts6998e	shut up. I don't want to talk to you.zts6999e	(Sotty helped <pname> and stepped back)zts7000e	get some rest. I will finish this. Rect, I will have to leave you. Got it?zts7001e	That's fine. Please take care of this situationzts7002e	Sotty, how could you..zts7003e	Latheore will be resurrected very soon. We will have to sacrifice Rect to save the time. Kid, don't look at me like that. There is no other option.zts7004e	Are you betraying us as well?zts7005e	Betrayal?zts7006e	That lady first planned with me for all of these. And she agreed to sacrifice Demons and help me planning, you know? You didn't directly ordered to <pname>, but via Demon called Rect.zts7007e	Re.. really? I can't believe this.zts7008e	yes. That is true. Surkhan is moving awkwardly all the time as he gets old. His staffs are also got nervous. Everybody got afraid of war and their boundaries are getting smaller. We need a war to survive. I believed that he should pick his sword up and fight against all odds. we then naturally need a tipping point. that tipping point is the resurrection of the Latheore.zts7009e	Even you were deceiving me? Really?zts7010e	yes.zts7011e	I shall not forgive you.zts7012e	you don't have to. Take a break.zts7013e	(The <pname> was paralyzed. Only his mind was awaken)zts7014e	the plan will be modified. If Rect dies, and the Pearl of Dusk is disappeared, the Latheore would become totally different. Maybe similar to Hellord. Latheore is also a part of Angelloan, so he might become a brand new Hellord, don't you think?zts7015e	I will not let that happen, Sogantti Darkstalker.zts7016e	you are nothing but an obstacle now. Let's go Roof gain. Destroyal to the enemy of us.zts7017e	(I have been deceived all the time. Angel, Demon, I can't forgive them. Never)zts7018e	(Erie approaches with wounded body)zts7019e	I am so sorry. I have deceived without noticing myself as a result. I will release your paralyzed body, even though it might take some time. This is my guardian medal. This is our family treasure, too. And the Slade Oxtern will protect you.zts7020e	What are you doing? Are you.zts7021e	I will prevent the resurrection. With all my power.zts7022e	what are you going to do with that wounded body?zts7023e	I will try.zts7024e	stop. Please.zts7025e	(Erie approaches to the pupa)zts7026e	Rect, I am so sorry for suspecting you.zts7027e	You are just like me. Rubbished.zts7028e	no we are not rubbished. We were loved.zts7029e	yeah. That kid. That's enough.zts7030e	I will help you preventing the resurrection.zts7031e	no. you will be absorbed by the back draft.zts7032e	I have made up my mind.zts7033e	the praising song of life is winding everywhere, Hope is growing from the dirt. The ideal is felt by everyone, sacred spirits blessing me. This is the will of the Latheore, it unifies with mine. All of my power shall come from him..zts7034e	what are you doing? Erie, are you also corrupted? Stop it. Your action is not justified. Latheore will punish you.zts7035e	Your match is me. Look at me!zts7036e	(Erie also absorbed to the pupa just like Rect)zts7037e	(It is not too late. I need to save the both. Move, move, please)zts7038e	(He crawled to the pupa. At that time, a shining flash light comes out of the pupa)zts7039e	This is the ring of the Radal?zts7040e	That is distilled heritage of Angelloan?zts7041e	that is surely parts of real Latheore, sealed by Ginas. How come he has them?zts7042e	Please, Please save Rect and Erie!!zts7043e	(The intensive light inside the pupa reacts with Radal's ring, the light slowly absorbed into the ring. It was apparent that it reacts to the perfectly refined Angelloan's Heritage)zts7044e	What is. this?zts7045e	Lv.67 Everybody looks strangezts7046e	Lv.70 Mysterious Orezts7047e	Lv.66 Investigation of Fastone Labzts7048e	Charlotte Main Questzts7049e	Lv.72 Peober is a hyper risky creature?zts7050e	Rectrart Main Questzts7051e	Lv.75 Where is the truth.zts7052e	Erie Main Questzts7053e	Lv.78 The Choice of Erie and Rectzts7054e	That place has smells of the dead only. I don't want to go.zts7055e	But if you don't go there, Sandra will not leave you alone. There is no other option.zts7056e	then I need to prepare, you depart first.zts7057e	Player: I will see you at the 2nd level of this buildingzts7058e	Alex: OK.zts7059e	I picked up strange ring, I need someone who can tell me about this.zts7060e	Can you show me?zts7061e	here you go.zts7062e	(Showed the Radal's Ring)zts7063e	wow. A ring with blue and red. Is this a pair?zts7064e	I think so.zts7065e	Celloin would be glad to see those rare stuff. Once I have seen him joyful as he saw rare jewelrieszts7066e	Hizts7067e	yes? Ah, Charlotte and Patrisha? They were complaining a lot about Koarens in Mt. Krem.zts7068e	They said they need to find a new place.. I think I heard they are going to Fir Woods.zts7069e	No. it is not what I am saying. It is just to prevent the monsters. you need a special element to open the seal. The legend says if you put cold heart, pure wild flower, and passion flower to the mouth of the statue, then the door would open.zts7070e	Don't be boasting around. This time is zombies. Off you go.zts7071e	I am healthy as always.. but.. there is something strange.zts7072e	I have encountered lizard on my walk, but they ran away as they saw mezts7073e	I was surprised. I didn't noticed but I was wearing a hat made of Racoony tail. Racoony birds pecked on me so I got a little scars.zts7074e	Is this someone secretly gave to me?zts7075e	(I was impressed about what you did to Wood zombies after hearing my story about them.)zts7076e	(Celloin is pleasantly surprised about you as I thought you were just an intelligent person.)zts7077e	(Hoho I will be waiting for you at the place that Sellbig promised. By Celloin.)zts7078e	(PS: I can't wait till I see the proposal event.)zts7079e	Hi, I got a good news. Celloins said she might marrying Sellbig. I think that is great.zts7080e	I am working on a special order under the guidance of high rank people. You will be able to meet my assistant while you are working on Jack's request. His name is Erie Windsphere, and has big javelin. Try not to fight when you meet.zts7081e	Tri Trikung used to be the woodkeeper. can't believe he is now a monster. Anyway, now Tri Trikung is gone, so deers should comeback. Thanks. You did a great job. Ah, Rodi wants to see you. He would like to find out what he asked to you the other day.zts7082e	the underground tunnel is north side of the Fir Woods. I can't believe that is the source of ore. We will find out more details.zts7083e	yes. She went to watermill. The water mill is in Maple Woods.zts7084e	The 3rd material I need is to be used for maintaining the volume of the product. the liver of the Kelberos, the trihead evil dog? Where can I find this? Hm.. there must be someone knows about this.. no, no. there is actually only one person. I don't want to ask anymore to him..zts7085e	thanks much. Haha. The black evil dog is hiding deep inside. Look closely into the northeast of the Fir Woods. Come to me anytime you need my help. And don't forget the money, too.zts7086e	I will stand at the front next time.zts7087e	Productionzts7088e	Patrishazts7089e	Give a gift 'cake'zts7090e	If you give me 20 red cookies, I will give you 'Magical darling' as a present.zts7091e	Yes, trade them.zts7092e	No, I will do next time.zts7093e	If you give me 20 red cakes, I will give you 'Magical darling' as a present.zts7094e	Golden soul stonezts7095e	I am wrapped up in holy light.zts7096e	I become calm because the warm energy spreads out whole my body.zts7097e	Guardian of light - Questzts7098e	It is the soul stone where Swordsman is able to get a Crusader card, Archer can get a Destroyer card and Sorcerer can get a Blue magician card.zts7099e	High personages who sacrificed themselves for saving their valued friends take their last sleep here.zts7100e	Stop! Don't move. This is the world of dead man.zts7101e	You are not man.zts7102e	What? I am surely man.zts7103e	Why do I feel demon's spirit from you?zts7104e	Because I had fought them before.zts7105e	Do demons come back?zts7106e	It is a problem. In my eyes, your talent is not enough to stop them if they start the war again.zts7107e	Yep, there is the way.zts7108e	I had defeated demons in ancient war with my fellows. However I lost my power, so I am not able to make you strong.zts7109e	My fellows could help you to become stronger. But. they are not here because they already fulfilled their duties.zts7110e	There is a way. If you collect their valuable mementoes, I will make you a chance to meet them.zts7111e	The first is 'Rebecca's jewel belt.'zts7112e	Blue magician received it from his fiancee. He treasured it in his life.zts7113e	I will give you the note about the belt. You will ask someone who knows jewel very well about it.zts7114e	(Celloin looks at the note.)zts7115e	It is 'Rebecca's jewel belt.' It has an inside story.zts7116e	You are lucky. I have it.zts7117e	But, jewel which is in the middle of the belt was broken.zts7118e	I heard the jewel was broken by itself when the owner's fiance had died.zts7119e	The jewel is 'Bloody stone.' It is very rare thing. So it isn't easy to get it again.zts7120e	Tell me. I will get it.zts7121e	I heard Monsters in cave of Mt. Krem have similar things. Bring them as many as possible. I will work them to fit the belt.zts7122e	Good job. Please wait just for a while.zts7123e	(Soon after, Celloin brings the belt.)zts7124e	It is the most similar to the real one.zts7125e	But it isn't the real. Don't expect too much of it.zts7126e	Skid treasured it very much. He brought it at all time.zts7127e	Skid?zts7128e	It is blue magician's name. He looked cold but he had warm heart.zts7129e	The next is 'Piena's diary.'zts7130e	It was left by his childhood friend.zts7131e	You will ask someone who knows books very well.zts7132e	Do you happen to know 'Piena's diary?'zts7133e	Piena's diary is.zts7134e	Ah, I saw it from where. Um, I remember seeing it in Lopello library.zts7135e	Do I have to go the library?zts7136e	But, I heard it is missing.zts7137e	Why?zts7138e	Librarians put the books in order during the war against Kovolts. At that time, Kovolts brought it because they thought it was a treasure.zts7139e	What can I do for returning it?zts7140e	I think Kovolts are not interested in books. So they don't have it.zts7141e	The diary has some miraculous magical power. Perhaps Dustdeaths at Mt. Krem bring it.zts7142e	As I expected, it doesn't get damaged without tearing a page because of magic. Give me a while. I will recover it like original.zts7143e	(After a while, he gives the diary.)zts7144e	Here it is.zts7145e	Skid told me he had come back his home for reading the diary.zts7146e	He frequently said he didn't have the past. But after reading the diary, he didn't say that anymore.zts7147e	Anyway, you are able to get a chance to meet my fellow Blue magician 'Skid Frozenheart.'zts7148e	Say hello to him.zts7149e	Some voice is heard when I recovered my senses.zts7150e	You look safe. Skid also fancies you.zts7151e	This time, you bring 'Ruddy's handkerchief' to me.zts7152e	It is Destroyer's. She treasured it uniquely. She received it as a birthday present from her old playfellow.zts7153e	I explain 'Ruddy's handkerchief' to Vellochika.zts7154e	I saw it once.zts7155e	Vellochika enters her house and brings something. Then she hides it behind her.zts7156e	I can't show the handkerchief.. He, he..zts7157e	I tried to wipe out a stain, but it is still a little dirty.zts7158e	I think I need special bleach for washing it. I should tend my store so. please bring it.zts7159e	I tell you materials of bleach.zts7160e	I need bean hull, special water bottle and flint. Monsters at Mt. Krem have them. So you are easily able to get them. Monsters in cave of Mt. Krem have some. You will look for them carefully.zts7161e	Ah! I need special bleach recipe also. Don't forget foggy giant have the recipe.zts7162e	Here it is. Perhaps the receiver likes it.zts7163e	Daisy was a hussy.zts7164e	My fellows and I called her 'Destroyer.'zts7165e	Then it became her nickname. She pretty liked itzts7166e	But she became lovely mediocre girl when she held the handkerchief in her hand. What a marvelous handkerchief it was. She was looked as if she fell into magic.zts7167e	The next is 'The elementary book of adventure.' It had influence on her to become a destroyer.zts7168e	Is it dangerous? No. It was well known book to adventurers as a textbook in those days. It is not dangerous what you expected.zts7169e	The great danger was Daisy herself. Hahaha.zts7170e	Do you know 'The elementary book of adventure?'zts7171e	Hey, you know the book. You have an appreciative eye. You are lucky.zts7172e	I have it.zts7173e	It is first-edition of The great adventurer 'Indicluto.' It is very valuable!zts7174e	Would you give me the book?zts7175e	One million gold.zts7176e	What? Pardon?zts7177e	I will sell it at one million gold.zts7178e	What? Why is it expensive?zts7179e	It is worth over 10 million gold. It is very cheap. I am obliged to sell it because I don't have a way to save up installment saving in this month. T-Tzts7180e	Iron lady is crying.zts7181e	But it is acting.zts7182e	Thanks to you, I come out the red.zts7183e	It is a great. Do you read it? I think it is the most valuable passage in this book.zts7184e	The ruins are the gift to the moderners from the ancients for showing their life. We talk to the ancients through the ruins.zts7185e	Do you also make a venture for meeting someone?zts7186e	It's time to meet destroyer 'Daisy.' If she doesn't like you, don't give up. She is a warm-hearted person, even if she outwardly grumbles.zts7187e	Whoosh~zts7188e	Doesn't she throw a bomb at you?zts7189e	You seemed to have a hard time. Ha ha ha.zts7190e	You should look for 'Necklace of lucky stone' from now on.zts7191e	Crusader treasured it as an amulet. She held it customarily when she prayed.zts7192e	Have you ever heard 'Necklace of lucky stone?'zts7193e	Oh! How do you know I have it?zts7194e	Just feeling!zts7195e	I have it what you said.zts7196e	But I inherit the necklace from my ancestors.zts7197e	I heard it belonged to some well-know crusader when angels and demons fought each otherzts7198e	However it is breaking. I guess lucky stone lost effect because a long time has passed.zts7199e	I should pour holy water to it for protecting the necklace from breaking.zts7200e	If you bring the water, I will give you the necklace. You are able to get the water in the end of Vertical Cave.zts7201e	Good job.zts7202e	(Holy water is poured to the lucky stone. The lucky stone's crack disappears amazingly.)zts7203e	It is lucky not to break the stone. You brought right water.zts7204e	Do you know the story of the necklace?zts7205e	The crusader was received it from her fiance.zts7206e	Fiance?zts7207e	The crusader was a girl.zts7208e	At that time, to become crusader was very difficult to woman. But she became a head of crusader.zts7209e	She saved cities from the war and became a national heroine.zts7210e	Great.zts7211e	I had thought she was a rough, but she was also a girl. So I have it with care.zts7212e	Anyway, it is time to be left from me.zts7213e	Take it.zts7214e	Originally the lucky stone was a pebble. It became a lucky stone because of her true heart prayer. Did you depend on something to realize your desire?zts7215e	You should seek for 'Justine's portrait.'zts7216e	It is easier than 'Necklace of lucky stone.'zts7217e	Justine's portrait' is explained.zts7218e	I am sorry. I don't have the portrait.zts7219e	I put the portrait into a small safe. But the small safe was stolen with a key.zts7220e	I can't step out now. But I know where the safe and key are.zts7221e	I will look for it. Tell me.zts7222e	I know Kovolts brought them, but Catcies snatched them from Kovolts.zts7223e	So Caticies at Shanera Dungeon have the key.zts7224e	How about the safe?zts7225e	The safe is small but very heavy. They can't hold it.zts7226e	Torturers in labyrinth of pain keep it in custody. They don't know PIN number so they couldn't remove the portrait.zts7227e	If you bring the safe and key, I will open the safe and give you the portrait.zts7228e	Here the portrait is.zts7229e	It is..zts7230e	It is Berserker's portrait. Are you disappointed?zts7231e	No, I don't know why my friend wants it.zts7232e	It is the portrait of the well-known Berserker. He saved cities in angel and demon's war. In those days, people brought his portrait as an amulet.zts7233e	To get it was very hard to even me.zts7234e	Can you give me such a valuable thing?zts7235e	Yes, it's yours. I decided to give you it since you had told me you looked for it.zts7236e	Good bye. Did you say someone seeks for it?zts7237e	Thanks.zts7238e	Crusader 'Seina' was introvert. So she didn't want to show other people the portrait.zts7239e	She believed the berserker gave her courage.zts7240e	Now, it is time to meet my last fellow crusader 'Seina.' Your choice decides whether she admits you or not.zts7241e	Don't forget. If justice is in you, she will know your heart.zts7242e	How was your meeting with Seina?zts7243e	Skid, Daisy and Seina. Why did they sacrifice themselves?zts7244e	With smile.zts7245e	How did they laugh like that? They went dying.zts7246e	Love. Because of love. They were able to die for people whom they loved.zts7247e	I can't understand.zts7248e	It can't be understood by mind but felt by heart.zts7249e	Congratulation! You passed my fellows' tests.zts7250e	But the test is not yet finished. The last test. You can't get a real power what you want unless you will pass the test I give.zts7251e	The test is you defeat Archtheridon who is the strongest demon in Hellord's other selves.zts7252e	It is the reason I gave you the previous tests. I want to know whether you can defeat him.zts7253e	Using them you brought, I will bring you to the past when I fought Archtheridon. I hope you will defeat him.zts7254e	Finally you defeated him! You clear my old score.zts7255e	The real enemy is not him but another!zts7256e	The real enemy is also judged by you adventurers.zts7257e	Your future is looked rough.zts7258e	I will give this in which my fellows' and my powers fill to you who passed all tests. Please use it for judgment.zts7259e	Thank you.zts7260e	The guardian of light - Time-spacezts7261e	[shrieking]zts7262e	A shriek is heard from where.zts7263e	Is Skid there?zts7264e	Die!zts7265e	Why?zts7266e	Yech, I have a splitting headache.zts7267e	I was mesmerized by a demon.zts7268e	Who are you?zts7269e	I say. I am a passing adventurer. What happen?zts7270e	I don't know why. Demons attacked this small village.zts7271e	I don't know.zts7272e	I have a favor to ask of you. Would you do my favor?zts7273e	I am going to go to defeat the head of demons.zts7274e	You mean I will go with you?zts7275e	Don't go ahead. It is a different thing. It is.zts7276e	Tell me.zts7277e	I had my friend's diary stolen to a demon. I hope you to take back it from him. He is a huge so it is easy to find him. Please.zts7278e	Here it is.zts7279e	You take it and this belt also. If a girl looks for me, please give them to her.zts7280e	Why? They are your valuable things, Skid.zts7281e	You know my name.zts7282e	I don't have a reason to explain to you.zts7283e	Take care of them.zts7284e	What will you do?zts7285e	You already know.zts7286e	Lots of demons are coming from a distance.zts7287e	Step back. If you come to me close, you will be swept by my magic.zts7288e	I don't forgive who plays with food!zts7289e	What?zts7290e	Daisy suddenly falls down.zts7291e	Poison.zts7292e	Someone put poison into food.zts7293e	I need.. an antidote.zts7294e	Did you put poison into Daisy's food?zts7295e	Give me an antidote!zts7296e	Is she poisoning?zts7297e	Didn't you?zts7298e	She is my friend. I don't have a reason to do.zts7299e	Tell me about her symptoms.zts7300e	Whitney listens to Daisy's symptoms.zts7301e	It needs two materials for neutralizing the poison. I have one of them and another one was stolen by demons. I give you the material I have. You will obtain anther one from demons and neutralize the poison.zts7302e	How about you?zts7303e	I have to do something. And.. I can't see her.zts7304e	Please don't tell her about me.zts7305e	Thanks.zts7306e	I am sorry, but I have a favor to ask of you.zts7307e	(Daisy gives a small bag.)zts7308e	Please transmit it to my father.zts7309e	(The temple's ceiling is collapsing.)zts7310e	Please. I should look for my friend.zts7311e	Who is your father?zts7312e	Stand back, Demon!zts7313e	Justine is waiting for me. If I don't go, he will die.zts7314e	I am not a demon.zts7315e	You are cowardly. Don't escape.zts7316e	[shrieking]zts7317e	Seina falls down holding her head in her arms as if she has a headache.zts7318e	A demon looks her from far away.zts7319e	The demon certainly controlled her.zts7320e	Seina! Are you ok?zts7321e	I am fine. I lost my senses for a while.zts7322e	Who are you? How do you know my name?zts7323e	Justine is in danger. We should go to him fast.zts7324e	Seina helps Justine who is falling down.zts7325e	A fool thing. You are stubborn.zts7326e	Seina?zts7327e	Demons are coming out of time-space.zts7328e	Stand away! I will enter time-space and keep off them.zts7329e	Take a rest.zts7330e	Seina sprinkles sleeping powder on Justine. Justine falls down.zts7331e	You.zts7332e	Seina kisses him with smile.zts7333e	Please live long instead of me.zts7334e	Adventurer, I will go time-space and keep off demons.zts7335e	Seina!zts7336e	Please take care of Justine. Thank you for helping me.zts7337e	Mind your eye!zts7338e	Wake up!zts7339e	Skid, Seina and Daisy. All you are safe.zts7340e	What are you saying? We are waiting because of you.zts7341e	(We hear a loud voice reverberated over the wall.)zts7342e	Blast it! Echekarue!!zts7343e	What a dreadful thing you are!zts7344e	The day I recover. You will die. I will also destroy Eastmile.zts7345e	I pledge my name 'Archtheridon.'zts7346e	Archtheridon?zts7347e	Archtheridon is the strongest demon in Hellord's other selves.zts7348e	It is the reason demons bring about the war in our world.zts7349e	What will you do next? Do you let them do what they want?zts7350e	Of course, guard against them.zts7351e	Go fast.zts7352e	Archtheridon makes his followers stand in the middle of the road.zts7353e	You defeated my followers and come to me.zts7354e	A fool thing.zts7355e	We can't see let you destroy our world.zts7356e	I should revenge. You are not able to make me stop.zts7357e	This world is where people I loved lived. I have a responsibility to saving the world.zts7358e	The name of light, I will defeat you.zts7359e	[Shouting] You are little things, make me stop my revenge. I won't fall down. I will come back.zts7360e	Fight is finished.zts7361e	Kaboom.zts7362e	The remainder of Archtheridon's power will be exploding.zts7363e	What do we do?zts7364e	We can prevent the exploding.zts7365e	Do fast.zts7366e	We have a problem.zts7367e	What is it? We don't have much time.zts7368e	I can cast protect magic upon only one person.zts7369e	The remainders will die.zts7370e	Yes.zts7371e	What's there to be worried about?zts7372e	You.zts7373e	Me? I can't do that. I will do with you.zts7374e	Don't be stubborn. You help us so much. We can come here because of you.zts7375e	We decide.zts7376e	We hope you to live from among. You are important and needed in the future war against demons.zts7377e	We always thank you.zts7378e	Please protect the world we don't exist.zts7379e	(It is a heavy explosion beyond protection.)zts7380e	Echekarue: There is not an obstacle.zts7381e	Echekarue: Disappear, Archtheridonzts7382e	Echekarue: I remember your anger and grudge.zts7383e	Spend reserveszts7384e	Reserves, which you received after buying Nosmall items, can be exchanged for gift boxes. You can exchange 90 points for 1 gift box, and randomly receive one of 8 items from the gift box.zts7385e	Yes, trade them.zts7386e	No, I will do next time.zts7387e	Dr.W eventzts7388e	Exchanging chewing gumzts7389e	Exchanging airwavezts7390e	Exchanging signboard of airwavezts7391e	Snowman eventzts7392e	Hahaha!

I come here because of the orders of a faultfinder.zts7438e	How annoying! But I should do I have to, shouldn't I?zts7439e	Talk with Rect Latzts7440e	I am Rect Lat. I am investigating something under the orders of Sotty. My task doesn't regard you at all, so don't care about it.zts7441e	Haven't you adventured your life on something?zts7442e	Of cause, you haven't. If you find the meaning of life, you can do.zts7443e	Talk with Charlottezts7444e	My knight~ I miss you so so much.zts7445e	Don't you miss me?zts7446e	Talk with Patrishazts7447e	Hi, long time no see.zts7448e	Ah, I have to say something to you.zts7449e	I prepare to make some new design accessories, will you join with me?zts7450e	Officialzts7451e	It is very fine and so good to go an adventure?zts7452e	Why don't you go an adventure with your close follows today?zts7453e	It is quite fun.zts7454e	Butler. HamaKungzts7455e	I am the butler of the great Lopello.zts7456e	My master was a famous adventurer in his young days. I have not seen yet the adventurer better than my master.zts7457e	Maybe, dare you think you are better than my master?zts7458e	The chefzts7459e	Don't forget you should prepare food when you make a venture.zts7460e	Even though you have good arms and defensive weapon, if you don't have any food, you can't put out your strength. Your partner and pet also need enough food.zts7461e	There is tasty food copiously, so you will choose something.zts7462e	Fashion designerzts7463e	Why do you wear the poor accessory?zts7464e	I am so sad. Dignity is important to even an adventurer.zts7465e	I prepare lots of things for valuable you. There are many accessories to make you look gorgeous.zts7466e	Product producerzts7467e	Making something and using that are very fruitful.zts7468e	Please make something by yourself and use that. It is so fun.zts7469e	Magical goods sellerzts7470e	Danger is the best friend of adventure. Of cause, it is not a welcome friend.zts7471e	If you are the great adventurer, you will agree to my opinion. To protect yourself from your best friend 'Danger,' you need magical goods.zts7472e	I will show you cheap things, but the effects are great.zts7473e	Person in charge of Nosmate/Mini Homezts7474e	These days, there are many construction sites because of increasing population.zts7475e	Therefore, people are well-off as compared with before.zts7476e	Ah, new structures come. If you need something, please tell me.zts7477e	Defensive weapon sellerzts7478e	Hey, you! What the poorest armor you wear!!zts7479e	That armor can't be defended from even wooly's attack. I tell only you, I have a legendary defensive weapon. It can defend you against a dragon's breathing.zts7480e	It is a little expensive but it is very cheaper than the value of your life.zts7481e	Arms sellerzts7482e	My brother hasn't seen a dragon. So he can't verify if his weapons can defend against a dragon's breathing or not.zts7483e	However my arms are different from his. They can cut through the dragon's thick skin.zts7484e	Of cause, I also haven't seen a dragon.zts7485e	Gray soul stonezts7486e	Strong dark spirit flows out from it.zts7487e	I can feel angry when I touch it. What did happen?zts7488e	Dark revenger &#8211; Questzts7489e	It is the soul stone where Swordsman is able to get a Berserker card, Archer can get a Wild keeper card and Sorcerer can get Dark gunner card.zts7490e	(Some parts of the soul stone are broken.)zts7491e	What happened?zts7492e	Someone had broken my memory.zts7493e	Who? Why?!zts7494e	I don't know. If the fragments of memory don't come back.zts7495e	This place can go out of your sight.zts7496e	I can't find my follows' successors yet.zts7497e	Hey, will you help me?zts7498e	Who, me?zts7499e	Here you are. It is the sample fragment of memory. I hope you will find the same thing like this.zts7500e	What brings you here today?zts7501e	(I show the sample fragment of memory to Sotty Bystander.)zts7502e	Do you know about it?zts7503e	You bring an interesting thing.zts7504e	Is it a fragment of memory? Very old memories are put in this fragment.zts7505e	(When Sotty Bystander touches the fragment, it turns violet for a little while.)zts7506e	What is the meaning?zts7507e	I think it means you will search a violet fragment of memory.zts7508e	Is it a sample?zts7509e	I think it has some information about the violet fragment of memory.zts7510e	Ok, I will read the memories in the fragment. Bring that.zts7511e	Here you are.zts7512e	You found it easily.zts7513e	Wait a minute. I will make it as a fragment of memory.zts7514e	(Her hands are shining and the fragment of memory turns violet.)zts7515e	Great! How do you make it?zts7516e	It was actually the fragment of memory. So it returned to the old figure.zts7517e	(I put the fragment on the broken part of the gray soul stone. The fragment is absorbed in an instant.)zts7518e	I have a question.zts7519e	What memory is in?zts7520e	Whitney Catherine, it has the memories about her.zts7521e	She is one of my follows, and an able Dark gunner.zts7522e	What happened?zts7523e	Strange.. I can't remember anything about her.zts7524e	How come? Does the fragment have any problem?zts7525e	Oh dear, someone rigged it.zts7526e	Adventurer.zts7527e	Find the clues about the fabricator with using the fragment.zts7528e	(I explain to the ancient soul what happened in time-space.)zts7529e	I see. So the clue is 'Angel.'zts7530e	Why did Whitney make a contract with Archtheridon? It was not reasonable.zts7531e	She had no choice except that.zts7532e	Because she was dying under a curse.zts7533e	Anyway, you should find the other fragments.zts7534e	This sample fragment of memory will help to find them.zts7535e	Eri, please see this.zts7536e	What? Ah, it is a fragment of memory?!zts7537e	(When Erie touches that, it becomes green.)zts7538e	I can see something.zts7539e	I will tell you what I see, so look for it.zts7540e	(Erie holds the necklace and the doll mildly.)zts7541e	(The things become the fragment of memory with green color.)zts7542e	It is the green fragment of memory. I can feel something warm.zts7543e	I am so happy to help you. He, he..zts7544e	(The green fragment is put on the broken part of the gray soul stone. It is absorbed in an instant.)zts7545e	It has Kupei's memory.zts7546e	Kupei had a strong sense of responsibility as a wild keeper and she was scanty of words.zts7547e	I miss her. The adventures I had gone with her are as if I did yesterday.zts7548e	You can gain the other clues by going back her memory.zts7549e	Can you do?zts7550e	Did you gain some clues?zts7551e	(I explain to him what happened in time-space.)zts7552e	The king of angels.. It is sure that angels made up.zts7553e	What is the 'Relic' Kupei was looking for?zts7554e	It is the thing the king of angels is sealed.zts7555e	It calls Ancelloan's Relic and its power is stronger than Time-space.zts7556e	It is same as the bomb nobody knows when it explodes.zts7557e	Why did Kupei watch the dangerous thing?zts7558e	Because she was the 'Relic' guarder. It was her duty.zts7559e	Angel, The king of angels. Clues are collected little by little. If you get more the fragments of memory, it will be clear. Ok, please get the next fragment of memory.zts7560e	I want to know about this fragment of memory.zts7561e	It is easy. Will you give it to me?zts7562e	(It turns red when it is touched with Rect's hand.)zts7563e	I feel anger and fury.zts7564e	Well, there is something unbecoming.zts7565e	I will tell you, so you will search for it.zts7566e	(When I give Crystal of demon and Ring of Seina, Rect hesitates for a little while.)zts7567e	(It is. the crystal which can distinguish a demon. Why?)zts7568e	(Rect snatches the crystal quickly and breaks it by grip.)zts7569e	Feel at ease. For making a fragment of memory easily, I broke it.zts7570e	(Rect makes the red fragment of memory with using Crystal of demon and Ring of Seina.)zts7571e	Here you are. You always put me to annoyance.zts7572e	No. Don't mind.zts7573e	(When the red fragment of memory touches the gray soul stone, it becomes dust and is absorbed.)zts7574e	It is about Justine.zts7575e	Justine Darkflame. It is berserker's name.zts7576e	Justine had lost his sweetheart because of an affair. He had searched for her far and wide but he couldn't find her.zts7577e	Unfortunately, he knew she had killed by Archtheridon.zts7578e	He heard Archtheridon had adventures with a girl, so he ran after Archtheridon.zts7579e	So did he give chase to Whitney?zts7580e	Find out that through the fragment of memory by yourself. You will get some important clues.zts7581e	(I explain to the ancient soul what happened in Time-space.)zts7582e	Justine may not want to be revenged.zts7583e	What is the meaning?zts7584e	He reproached himself because he couldn't protect Seina. So he looked for the place where he died.zts7585e	That is the berserker's destiny. Berserker can't live with right mind.zts7586e	Anyway, the clues are clear. Look out for the last fragment of memory.zts7587e	(Rodie touches a fragment of memory, it is shining in white.)zts7588e	It is..zts7589e	Can you see something?zts7590e	No, nothing.zts7591e	Ah. I see.zts7592e	I am sorry not to give any help to you. Please ask someone else.zts7593e	(Why was 'Spear of priest' shown in the fragment of memory? Is my plan leaked out? No, it is impossible.)zts7594e	(Sotty touches the fragment of memory and it is shining in white.)zts7595e	Hey~ it is so nice!!zts7596e	Can you see something?zts7597e	Yes, I can see 'Spear of priest.' It points at the spear.zts7598e	Where can I get it?zts7599e	I have. I bought a design of 'Unfinished spear of priest' from Sandra.zts7600e	You..zts7601e	She sold it at a special price. It was a little expensive but I bought. Honestly, I love to buy something at a bargain price.zts7602e	To you, I can sell it as the same price I paid. Will you?zts7603e	Here you are.zts7604e	You have only design now, so you should collect materials written in the design. After collecting them, you can make the spear.zts7605e	Come to see me after making the spear.zts7606e	Wow, you made it! Good job!zts7607e	However, 'Spear of priest' should have blessing of angel. but it doesn't have. With this I can't make a fragment of memory.zts7608e	How should I do?zts7609e	Does anyone look like an angel near you?zts7610e	Eri, do you happen to know how to give a thing 'blessing of angle'?zts7611e	Well, why do you ask me about that?zts7612e	Somehow I think you know about angles. Hehe..zts7613e	Phew, I see. I don't know about angels well, I will do my best to help you.zts7614e	Anyway, which thing do you give blessing of angel to?zts7615e	I should make it as a fragment of memory.zts7616e	It is a 'Spear of priest.'zts7617e	I can't give blessing of angel to this spear, but if I use my spear, I can do.zts7618e	I will do once.zts7619e	(When Erie grips 'spear of priest,' it is shining in white.)zts7620e	I am so happy to help you.zts7621e	Ah! Really it is blessed!?zts7622e	Ok, I will show you my ability!zts7623e	(When Erie grips spear of priest, it is shining in white.)zts7624e	Here you are. It is the white fragment of memory.zts7625e	(When the white fragment was touched with gray soul stone, it is absorbed in an instant.)zts7626e	As expected, I have lost my memory because of them.zts7627e	The fragments of memory have lots of information. And especially they are invented about my memory of Echekaluel.zts7628e	It is certain that Echekaluel and some angels make up this event.zts7629e	With using the fragments of memory, you should go to the time when my fellows had fought Echekaluel.zts7630e	If you didn't win the battle, the made-up memories will break the rest of my memory. Please defeat Echekaluel.zts7631e	Can you do?zts7632e	I can go to see my follows now because of you.zts7633e	They also thank you.zts7634e	I will give you my follows' power. Please protect your valued friends with this power.zts7635e	I hope you will not experience a tragedy like ours.zts7636e	Thank you so much from the depth of my heart. New hero, I entrust you with keeping peace in the future.zts7637e	Dark revenger &#8211; Time spacezts7638e	(A girl is entering underground which is crumbling.)zts7639e	Dangerous!zts7640e	Don't block me. Daisy is there. I should go to save her.zts7641e	(The downhill is blocked.)zts7642e	No! Daisy!!zts7643e	You, you are Daisy's friend. Why did you block me?!zts7644e	Please look for another way. It is dangerous here.zts7645e	You can't have access more. You, humble thing.zts7646e	Where is Daisy? Tell!!zts7647e	Human?zts7648e	Are you demon?zts7649e	My name is Archtheridon Hellduke.zts7650e	You, will you make a contract with me?zts7651e	You are dying under a curse. If you make a contract with me, you can survive.zts7652e	Do you want to revenge the death of your friend?zts7653e	What do you want to get from me?zts7654e	Revenge against angles. Same as you.zts7655e	Will you do?zts7656e	Yes, I will.zts7657e	Please stop it.zts7658e	I promised my friend that I would survive at any cost.zts7659e	Then I should revenge Daisy's death.zts7660e	Thank you for caring.zts7661e	Whitney!zts7662e	Stop! Thief, return 'Relic' to me!zts7663e	Ah? I am not a thief!zts7664e	I think you are a thief. You should have said that earlier.zts7665e	I said I was not.zts7666e	Ah? What is it? Monkey?zts7667e	My friend, Pipei.zts7668e	Thank you.zts7669e	Thank you? For what?zts7670e	Please help me to search for 'Relic.'zts7671e	Strange. Surrounding animals become ferocious.zts7672e	I haven't seen such a state before.zts7673e	Our duty is to resurrect the king of angels, don't obstruct me!zts7674e	What did you plot it? You!!zts7675e	Don't run away! Stop!!zts7676e	Don't follow them. It can be a trap.zts7677e	Kupei, dangerous!!zts7678e	Dark revenger &#8211; Time spacezts7679e	Be careful, Seina's enemy!zts7680e	I will get even with you.zts7681e	Ugh.zts7682e	Wait a minute.zts7683e	Step aside! If you stop me, I will kill you.zts7684e	I can't be done over untouched.zts7685e	Echekaluel is near here.zts7686e	I see. First, we should get out of here.zts7687e	Damn it! Run away.zts7688e	Adventurer, I don't have time to enjoy with you.zts7689e	Stop!zts7690e	Echekaluel!! Stop!!zts7691e	Are you still alive with the disgusting feature?zts7692e	You, you still make me sick.zts7693e	Why did you make Daisy die? Tell!!zts7694e	What are you saying now? The murderer of your friend is Archtheridon. Don't mix up.zts7695e	Lie.zts7696e	You had made them go to the place where Archtheridon was, and had raised an explosion. So Daisy died.zts7697e	You. you watched the situation from the first to the end!!zts7698e	Oh dear, it's too bad. You know that, it is quite unexpected.zts7699e	Yes, yes. I did.zts7700e	Huhu. Don't you think the way is better than I do? As you know, demons are so dirty.zts7701e	Come sisters, kill them. Make them not go to the place where the king of angels resurrects.zts7702e	Stop! Echekaluel.zts7703e	I will help you. Ok?zts7704e	I will not say sorry. After revenging, I will bring to an end.zts7705e	If I step forth a little more, my revenge will be done.zts7706e	When all is done, I can go to see Seina.zts7707e	Seina, wait for me. I will go soon.zts7708e	Waste no time. It is the enemy's camp.zts7709e	Justine, how can you come here?zts7710e	How can such a person become our leader? Is it ok, Arcke?zts7711e	<pname> looks like that, <pname> won me. Don't worry.zts7712e	<pname>, it's ok. I can understand you if you are hungry.zts7713e	Whitney, Kupei, are you ok?zts7714e	Strange. Do you get hurt in the head?zts7715e	We don't have time to crack a joke. Is it certain that Echekaluel is here?zts7716e	Sure, she is here.zts7717e	What does she plot it?zts7718e	She posts her adjutants in front of the gateway. It is troublesome.zts7719e	No problem, if something obstructs me, I will break it.zts7720e	Echekaluel!!zts7721e	You are so tenacious. Why do you such a rash thing?zts7722e	I lost my dearest because of you! If I don't revenge her death, with what face I can see her.zts7723e	Come on.zts7724e	My valuable friend, she had made me have a new hope, died because of your intrigue.zts7725e	Even you treated my friend as a warm. I can't forgive you.zts7726e	I will fight against you for world peace. Relic' does not exist for your greed.zts7727e	We all together will defeat you. Come on.zts7728e	I'm the high priest.. but.. I suffer a defeat like this..zts7729e	I can't die as it is.zts7730e	Ah- ah- Don't worry, I will guide you to hell.zts7731e	You are not lonely.zts7732e	I also help you.zts7733e	Oh, I am sorry to induce you in this battle.zts7734e	When I had made a contract, I decided.zts7735e	There is the end. Is this place where I die?zts7736e	What are you doing now, escape here!zts7737e	Please take it.zts7738e	It is. the Relic!zts7739e	I can give it into you, and please take care of Pipei.zts7740e	What is the meaning? How come you not to allow me to join with you? Why?zts7741e	I am your fellow! I will be with you all together!zts7742e	I killed lots of enemies, and finally I revenged on my enemy.zts7743e	Now I should protect my fellow, you.zts7744e	As you know, I promised my friend that I would survive at any cost.zts7745e	From now, you will keep my word instead of me.zts7746e	I am so happy after I first met you. Thank you.zts7747e	I should perform my duties as a wild keeper. I am also happy to protect you.zts7748e	Don't do that.zts7749e	Don't cry. Live and protect the world instead of us.zts7750e	We can see someday again after you perform your duties.zts7751e	Do you understand?zts7752e	Bye.zts7753e	(The place burst with stupendous light.)zts7779e	Lv.81 Frozen Crownzts7780e	Act4 Quest_Frozen Crownzts7781e	Hello. How are you feeling?zts7782e	(In a weak voice) Okay.zts7783e	Fighting!zts7784e	(Startled) Huh??zts7785e	<pname>, you don't sound like yourself. <pname>, you're a hero and great pride to all of us at Nos Camp. I want you to be cheerful and smiling all the time.zts7786e	I don't know what happened to you, but I want you to cheer up, okay?zts7787e	Oh, wait. I just received a new request. I don't know why, but Ms. Sandra Blake said that she wants you to do something for her <pname>.zts7788e	Also this is my personal letter. Could you deliver it to Sandra Blake please.zts7789e	(Sandra reads Eril's letter and mumbles.)zts7790e	Tut, He's worried over nothing.zts7791e	Don't mind me. I was just talking to myself.zts7792e	Ms. Sandra Blake, why did you ask for me?zts7793e	Of course, it's because I have no one else to ask.zts7794e	I'm not saying you're incompetent. It's just that I don't have anyone to ask a favor at the moment.zts7795e	It's not that difficult. Just deliver my letter to Steward Hamakung at Ropello House in Brookhild. I'm sure you can do that much for me, right?zts7796e	Well, it can be done by someone else.zts7797e	Go and come back, now!zts7798e	(You see a sorcereress asking Steward Hamakung for something in desperation.)zts7799e	Frozen Crown is in danger. We need Nos Camp's help.zts7800e	Didn't I tell you we'll do everything possible to help?zts7801e	The date you told me is too late Steward Hamakung. We're desperate.zts7802e	Nos Camp is very busy doing what East Mile asked us to do. Also you are located far away from here which makes it all te more difficult for us to help you.zts7803e	Then let me see Sir Ropello. I'm sure he would help.zts7804e	My master is busy at the moment. And my master left this matter to me. Please wait for now.zts7805e	I'll be waiting at the port. Don't forget to let me know.zts7806e	(The sorcereress leaves the scene.)zts7807e	(Mumbling) How many times do I have to tell you? Why can't you understand it means no? You're very irritating.zts7808e	Hello.zts7809e	(Irritated) What do you want?zts7810e	Well, I'm here to deliver Ms. Sandra Blake's letter.zts7811e	She never gives up. Give me the letter.zts7812e	Here. Eh? Why did you tear it without even reading it?zts7813e	I don't have to read it because I already know what it says. I don't know how many times she sent the same letter.zts7814e	Aren't you an adventurer from the Nos Camp? Don't tell me you became an adventurer to do something as useless as this.zts7815e	(Steward Hamakung stares at your for a moment and claps his hands as if he came up with a brilliant idea.)zts7816e	Oh, you can go to Frozen Crown. If you're good enough to run errands for Sandra Blake, it means she thinks of you as a qualified adventurer. It's good you came here. The sorceress has been bugging me for days.zts7817e	(Steward Hamakung points his finger at the port and continues.)zts7818e	First of all, go meet a sorceress named Leika Cutlass at the port.zts7819e	But I need to get a response to the letter.zts7820e	Don't worry about something so trivial. You are about to do something very important. So think only about that. Now go to the port at once.zts7821e	So you must be the best adventurer of the Nos Camp who will be dispatched to Frozen Crown, right? I'm so glad to see you! What should I do? I didn't know you'd come so soon. I don't know what to say?zts7822e	All Steward Hamakung told me is to come see you, Ms. Leika Cutlass.zts7823e	Whew! I was getting really worried. Steward Hamakung seemed like he didn't want to help me at all when I was talking to him.zts7824e	But I didn't know he was going to send someone so great as you. I'm so glad. Steward Hamakung must be a good person, don't you think so?zts7825e	Wait, listen to me please.zts7826e	(Startled) Pardon me?zts7827e	I'm not as great as you think I am. I cannot help you.zts7828e	Did you say you're not a great person? I can feel the power and warmth from you. Why do you sound so unsure?zts7829e	Well, I failed to protect my own partner. How can I help others? I.zts7830e	(Leika Cutlass is looking at you with sorrowful eyes.)zts7831e	You didn't lose just your partner.zts7832e	What do you mean?zts7833e	You have lost something far more important, which is yourself. I think you must find something important for you instead of helping us. Please come back to me when you're feeling better.zts7834e	(First of all, tell Ms. Sandra Blake that Steward Hamakung tore up the letter.)zts7835e	What happened? Did he say he understood? Did he say okay? Did he say he would do it?zts7836e	He tore up the letter without saying anything.zts7837e	Oh, it was the 101th letter.zts7838e	Eh? You sent that many letters?zts7839e	Of course. I always do my best to increase my savings. I will never give up!zts7840e	Why do you try so hard? For what?zts7841e	It's because of my belief. I never give up until I'm satisfied. I've heard that you recently lost your partner, is that true?zts7842e	How did you know?zts7843e	So it was true. That's why you look so sad. Oh, by the way did you ask me how I found out? You don't have to know that.zts7844e	Someone asked me to say something comforting to you, but don't expect me to be so kind.zts7845e	Eh? You're too straightforward.zts7846e	Listen to me carefully. You're not the only one who lost a partner. Even I lost my partners while on many adventures.zts7847e	But unlike you, I still live like this. I didn't change a bit. Don't think I didn't care for my partners. We all have different values.zts7848e	The difference between you and me is that I lost my partners, but you lost yourself. As long as I remember my partners and cherish the moments I shared with them, they still live within me. Do you understand?zts7849e	You partners must have asked you to do something, right?zts7850e	Then do that. That's the only way you can save yourself.zts7851e	Don't thank me. I'll bill you for this advice. I ought to thank you. Ha, ha, ha.zts7852e	You're very harsh too.zts7853e	Oh, take this to Frozen Crown. It's a recommendation letter. Show it to the Great Wizard Fair Roshu. He'll understand.zts7854e	(Now go see Leika Cutlass.)zts7855e	I see you have regained your strength.zts7856e	I owe it to you. Tell me how I can help.zts7857e	First, you must go to Frozen Crown to learn the details. Get ready to leave. If you want to see someone before you go, go see them now.zts7858e	(Who else could that be? Lets meet Eril before you start!!)zts7859e	Hello. I'm glad you have regained your strength.zts7860e	I'll try to do what is expected of me. I'm thinking about going to Frozen Crown.zts7861e	Are you sure? It can be dangerous.zts7862e	I know that. I also know that its very hard life there, but I'll try to protect the peace that exists instead of mourning my lost partners.zts7863e	You have grown to be a true adventurer.zts7864e	I still have much to learn. He, he.zts7865e	Here is the 'Lateor's Egg' you left earlier. You left it here some time ago. It must be important to you, right?zts7866e	I almost forgot. Thank you.zts7867e	Be careful, <pname>zts7868e	I'll be back.zts7869e	It will be a long journey. You didn't forget anything, did you? Let's go then.zts7870e	Here we are at last.zts7871e	I still have much to prepare, so I cannot go with you from here on. This is my recommendation letter. Go see Rudin Frozen Heart at the Magic Research Institute in the center of the town, and he will gladly show you around. Come back to me if you return to East Mile.zts7872e	(Leika Cutlass clears her throat and talks to you in a cheerful voice.)zts7873e	Welcome to Frozen Heart Citadel. I hope we can be friends.zts7874e	(Rudin Frozen Heart reads Leika's recommendation letter.)zts7875e	You look kind of stupid, but then the recommendation letter says otherwise. Interesting.zts7876e	Oh, you must be <pname>? It's good to see you. I'm Rudin Frozen Heart, one of the Blue Magicians. I'm charge of escorting the adventurers who come here to help us.zts7877e	Are there others besides me?zts7878e	That's right. We need all the help we can get. We're asking other regions to help us.zts7879e	I see. How can I help you?zts7880e	First of all, I'll give you a mission according to what the recommendation letter says about you. Don't worry. I won't give you a mission that's too dangerous.zts7881e	Since you're here, you must go see the Great Wizard Fair Roshu before anything. He's the head of Frozen Heart Citadel. I told him you're here, so go see him.zts7882e	(You hear a beast growling at you.)zts7883e	(Startled) Eh?zts7884e	Don't worry. He's not violent. He's my pet.zts7885e	Welcome. I was expecting you. Hmm. You also brought the letter I've been waiting for.zts7886e	Hello. It's nice to meet you. My name is..zts7887e	I already know. <pname>.zts7888e	How did you?zts7889e	It's just one of the little tricks an old wizard can do.Dont be surprised. What's more important is your decision to help us. It couldn't have been an easy decision. I admire your courage.zts7890e	What's happening at Frozen Crown? I understand it's something urgent.zts7891e	It's a long story. Please gather your patience and listen to me.zts7892e	We originally lived in the center of Frozen Crown in secrecy. For some reason, we were banned from that place. It happened so fast that we still don't know how that was possible.zts7893e	I think it was done by some great power, but we don't know that for sure. We have built the Frozen Heart Citadel here to regain our home, and we're also forming an army to fight. When we went out of Frozen Heart Citadel, monsters were not the only ones waiting for us. Along with them a big curse that happens to be the real threat to us. The curse is so powerful that even our magic couldn't break it.zts7894e	What kind of curse is it?zts7895e	You're automatically cursed as soon as you step out of this castle. You get transformed into an animal called seal. I have gathered some of the curse energy, so I can transform you this very moment.zts7896e	(Great Wizard Fair Roshu takes out some powder from a small pouch and sprinkles it on you.)zts7897e	Nothing happened.zts7898e	(Startled) I can't believe it. You're immune to the curse. What's the item shining in your pocket?zts7899e	It's called Lateor's Egg. My partner is sealed inside the stone.zts7900e	That's amazing. That item protects you from curse. My fortune telling is never wrong. Ha, ha.zts7901e	What fortune telling?zts7902e	We were locked inside this citadel and couldn't do anything because of the great power. We used the power of fortune telling to find a way out of here so we can do something. We were told that an adventurer like you would be a here to help us.zts7903e	I think you're the adventurer. Now I'm sure the fortune telling was right now that I can see you in person.zts7904e	I want you to help us. Rudin Frozen Heart will tell you what you need to do. He's a talented blue magician, except that he's way too hot tempered.zts7905e	Don't worry. He's not that eccentric. You may go now. I welcome you to Frozen Heart Citadel with all my heart.zts7906e	Great Wizard Fair Roshu is a great man. He's my teacher as well. Without him, there won't be any Blue Magicians left.zts7907e	I'll tell you what you need to do first. Right now, other people cannot walk outside the citadel because of the curse. That's why only you can do this because you have that Lateor's Egg that blocks the curse.zts7908e	Aren't you being too irresponsible?zts7909e	I know and I'm sorry, but I'm asking you a favor. First go outside the citadel and gather information. Make sure to let me know if there's anything strange out there.zts7910e	Did you see you saw penguins?zts7911e	They must be the Pirate Penguins. Then this logbook must be theirs.zts7912e	Hmm. According to the logbook, they're gathering some information here because their ship was wrecked. I think they're able to conduct an investigation without any problems because they're immune to the curse. It also says they've been to Bitoren Tundra, which is far away from Frozen Heart Citadel.zts7913e	The Central Barrier Stone? What's the Central Barrier Stone? There must be a reason why we Blue Magicians cannot go out of Frozen Heart Citadel.zts7914e	<pname>, I'll verify the information you brought me. Meanwhile, I want you to gather more information. I'm not sure I can send you to Bitoren Tundra just yet.zts7915e	It was written to report our activities to someone. I cannot believe they were watching our every move. It's hard to believe these stupid Nools are working in teams.zts7916e	There must be a master mind behind all this. It can be dangerous, but I have no choice other than ask you to investigate Bitoren Tundra? I believe you can find some valuable information there.zts7917e	Just for your information, you may see other adventurers besides yourself. And they might attack you because they don't know who you are. So be careful.zts7918e	Although Lateor's Egg protects you, it will cease to function if it's badly damaged. You might be affected by the curse if that happens, so be careful. Good luck.zts7919e	I've read your report on Bitoren Tundra carefully. Just as I thought, it's heavily guarded in the center. It used to be our home, and the monsters must be occupying the place now.zts7920e	This tablet is written in an ancient language. Why was it there?zts7921e	Unfortunately, I don't really understand the ancient language. Great Wizard Fair Roshu is the only one who can read the ancient language. Take this to Great Wizard Fair Roshu.zts7922e	(Great Wizard Fair Roshu reads the tablet very carefully.)zts7923e	I cannot believe this. It's a magic tablet that's been missing for a long time. It's written with a spell that activates the barrier. I'm sure Mukraju lost it.zts7924e	Who's Mukraju?zts7925e	He was a talented Blue Magician and my friend. It's been missing ever since we fled to this place. He used to hold on to this.zts7926e	According to the report, a single master mind could be planning all this.zts7927e	However, I still don't have a decisive evidence so I can't even take a guess. I've heard that the Nool Scout was working for someone, so I want you to go and gather some information from the Nool Scouts.zts7928e	Lord Morcos! Are you sure they mentioned this name?zts7929e	How can it be? I can't believe he's involved in this.zts7930e	Who's Lord Morcos?zts7931e	He's the ruler of the Shares Canyon in the western part of Frozen Crown. He's a very powerful and brave warrior. And his army is after Frozen Heart Citadel. This is an emergency.zts7932e	First of all, find out who's communicating with Lord Morcos.zts7933e	How can this be? So we were banned from Frozen Crown because of Mukraju. It's unbelievable. It's hard to believe he became an Undead Sorcerer called Leech.zts7934e	What kind of person was he?zts7935e	He was a great wizard who loved the power of magic. But then he was corrupted by someone called the Master. It saddens me to hear that he is corrupted, but I feel more angry than sorry when I think of all the Blue Magicians who were killed because of his corruption.zts7936e	Thanks to you, we found a way to fight the great power that threatens us. I cannot thank you enough. Since we have a fight at hand now, I shall reward you later.zts7937e	I've done some research on Lateor's Egg because I thought you might need it. I couldn't overlook it either because it was mentioned in Mukraju's book.zts7938e	I left the research results with Rudin Frozen Heart, so go talk to him.zts7939e	Actually, it's hard to believe that your partner is locked inside this Lateor's Egg. In order to lock up someone inside an item, you must know if the person's natural property matches the Lateor's Egg. It's impossible to put a human inside Lateor's Egg. It could be possible if that someone has a property similar to the Lateor's Egg.zts7940e	My partners who are sealed are Angel and Demon.zts7941e	Okay. It made more sense when I found out that your partners are similar to it.zts7942e	Blue Magicians have been studying mysterious items for a long time. I'm kind of lost because we have never conducted this kind of research. When it comes to barriers and seals, Mukraju, who's a Leech called Lord Mukraju now, was the best. According to Mukraju's Magic Book here, it's not impossible to break the seal of Lateor's Egg. But it's not easy either.zts7943e	This is all I can tell you. You'll go on a journey to a bigger world. You'll get what you want when the opportunity presents itself. Don't give up hope.zts7944e	You have helped us, so we have tried our best to break the seal. I'm sorry we couldn't be of much help. We will continue to study about Lateor's Egg.zts7945e	When we find something important, we'll send a message to the Nos Camp. We're eternally indebted to you. Thank you very much.zts7946e	(Rudin Frozen Heart says good bye in a very polite manner.)zts7947e	May Mana bless the great warrior.zts7948e	Act4 Space Time-Lord Mukrajuzts7949e	Kekung. It's a message from Lord Morcos. Deliver it.zts7950e	Understood. Lord Mukraju will receive it. I'm delivering it.zts7951e	Check and see if there is a chaser.zts7952e	I must go to Lord Mukraju right now.zts7953e	You fools. How did you get caught by just an adventurer. I'm a fool for trusting these fools.zts7954e	Kekung. I'm sorry.zts7955e	If you have the time to say something foolish like that, use the time to kill the adventurers.zts7956e	My master is angry. I'll kill you instead of my master.zts7957e	What are you going to do with the power of chaos mixed with darkness and light. It's not nearly powerful as my master's power.zts7958e	This is just a phantom. I'm just going back to my master. I'll be back when the time comes.zts7959e	Merry Easterzts7960e	I.. I can feel something strange.zts7961e	D.. o you look for Easter eggs and s.. oul of Easter during the adventure?zts7962e	P.. leas.. e.. bring the Easter eggs and soul of Easter to me.. I.. Will make the egg.. s with the soul hatch out a fairy.zts7963e	Here you are.zts7964e	I will do next.zts7965e	Please bring soul of Easter and 4 colors of Easter egg.. s to me. I.. will inject the soul to the egg and hatch fairies out of eggs.zts7972e	Look! Isn't that fairy shining. It may look small and gentle but if you look carefully you can see it's a dog in the manger. If you want your fairy to be nice and friendly with you, just take good care of them and show them lot of love! OK?zts7973e	Exchange Sealzts7974e	Oh My God!! Greeny Bob is here. Please protect us from it!!zts7975e	But to go to Greeny Bob, you need a seal of team. If you give me 3 meats, bamboo leaves and rices, I can give you the seal in exchange.zts7976e	Exchange it for the seal!!zts7977e	I will bring these items!!zts7978e	Angel and Demon Campszts7979e	There are Angel and Demon Teams.zts7980e	Pick a team.zts7981e	Time Circle (Brookhild)zts7982e	Sharing (Related to Family)zts7983e	When you reach Job Lv.20, you can change your job adventurer. You must think carefully because once you change your job, you cannot change it back.zts7984e	Okay, what kind of job do you want?zts7985e	I want to be a swordsman, a master fighter with a strong body.zts7986e	I want to be an archer, a sharp shooter with speed.zts7987e	I want to be a sorcerer that controls the battlefield with various magic spells.zts7988e	No, I'll change my job next time.zts7989e	Family is a team of users within NosTale.zts7990e	A wonderful family where people help each other as friends! Enjoy the happy world of NosTale with other players!zts7991e	All you need to do is form a party of three, one of you may ask me. You must pay a fee though. It's only 200,000 Gold for creating one!zts7992e	I'm sorry. The family feature is not completely developed, so some of the interface options do not work yet.zts7993e	We'll provide the services in the near future.zts7994e	Steward Hamakung (Brookhild)zts7995e	Ms. Margaret (Food)zts7996e	Ha, ha, ha. I have freshly baked bread and roast meat, so come see me whenever you're hungry.zts7997e	Alice Green (Accessory)zts7998e	Welcome! Buy pretty accessories and add an option too!zts7999e	What's an option?zts8000e	Oh no! Don't you know what options are? Accessories are not just for making yourself look good.zts8001e	Tada! You can imbue an accessory with various magic skills! Are you surprised? He, he.zts8002e	You need a Cellon to imbue an accessory with magic skills. It's a magic stone that can be cut in Gillion Stone.zts8003e	An accessory has option slots and option level. The option slot tells you up to how many Cellons you can add, and the option level lets you know what level Cellon you can insert.zts8004e	He, he. Do you know what an option is? Buy some accessories for telling you this!zts8005e	Okay. Thank you for letting me know!zts8006e	Noel Rosa (Miscellaneous Store)zts8007e	Hello! I have many high quality items! Feel free to take a look around. You don't have to buy anything.zts8008e	Phillips Lion (Alchemist)zts8009e	You look like you want to know something. What is it?zts8010e	What's alchemy?zts8011e	What's Special Card Upgrade?zts8012e	What's a Shell?zts8013e	No. Bye.zts8014e	Alchemy is used to craft powerful items by using various materials.zts8015e	I'm sure you have collected various materials during your adventure. Don't throw them away just because they look useless. They're all useful.zts8016e	Just bring me the materials. I'll make you all kinds of potions and consumable items.zts8017e	Thank you. I'll collect materials and come back here.zts8018e	Just like weapons and clothes, Special Cards can be upgraded too. A Special Card can be upgraded up to Level 15.zts8019e	When you successfully upgrade an item, you will gain additional status points. You'll also gain a pretty set of wings when you transform into a Specialist.zts8020e	However, you must be careful adventurer. If you fail, the soul of the Special Card can disappear. Special Cards without a soul cannot be worn.zts8021e	I've heard that you can resurrect the soul if you purchase a Soul Resurrection Stone at a store called Nosmall. It's expensive, so it's best to prevent the disappearance of the soul.zts8022e	Shell? It's a Clam Shell engraved with a magic spell. This magic spell is powerful indeed.zts8023e	Shells are imbued with magical power. And items can be imbued with the magical power as well. If you do that, you'll have powerful magic items.zts8024e	Of course you can fail. It doesn't break your items just because you fail, but you should be careful just the same because the Shell disappears.zts8025e	Oh, one more thing! This is the most important thing. Items imbued with a Shell's magical power cannot be worn by others. It's because they become your exclusive items.zts8026e	Well, I've heard that you can buy good smelling perfume at Nosmall and sprinkle it on the item to wear someone else's item, but I'm not sure.zts8027e	Edwarde Albert (Mini Land)zts8028e	Your good friend Nosmate, and your comfortable home Mini Land! Maintaining these two places is my job!zts8029e	I have a question about Nosmate.zts8030e	I have a question about Mini Land.zts8031e	I'll come back later.zts8032e	Okay, what do you want to know?zts8033e	How do I give an item to my partner?zts8034e	I want to change my Nosmate.zts8035e	I want to discard my Nosmate!zts8036e	How do I feed a Nosmate?zts8037e	How do I use the Pet Trainer?zts8038e	Exchange your weapons and clothes with Partner Exclusive Items by using the Exchange Partner Items option.zts8039e	Then press 'P' to open the Character Info Window. Click the partner of your choice, and then double click Partner Item to give an item to your partner.zts8040e	You need to enter your Mini Land in order to change your Nosmate.zts8041e	Click the Partner or Pet you wish to change, and the click the Accompany button on top to exchange your Nosmate with a new one.zts8042e	Click the Nosmate you're currently accompanying and then click the 'Stay at home' button, and you won't have to accompany your Nosmate anymore.zts8043e	Are you sure you want to discard your Nosmate when it's your old friend? I'm sorry.zts8044e	Buy a Pet Remover or Handkerchief of Goodbye and then enter your Mini Land.zts8045e	Click the Nosmate you wish to discard, and use the Pet Remover or Handkerchief of Goodbye. You can discard the Nosmate that's been accompanying you.zts8046e	You must first return to your Mini Land in order to feed your partner with a decoction or pet food.zts8047e	Click the Nosmate to feed in Mini Land, and then double click the food.zts8048e	Your pet cannot accompany you when its Loyalty Level reaches 0, so you need to feed your pet as often as possible.zts8049e	Use the Pet Trainer to increase your pet's damage/defense level and upgrade your pet.zts8050e	First enter your Mini Land and use the Pet Trainer when there is no one to disturb you. Then your pet and the Pet Trainer will start fighting automatically.zts8051e	Be careful not to attack the trainer yourself, because it will be no use. Also, the damage/defense level might go down when you use the Pet Trainer.zts8052e	How do I share items between accounts?zts8053e	What's Production Center?zts8054e	Buy the warehouse I sell and install it in your Mini Land to share items between accounts.zts8055e	However, characters within the same account must also purchase and install a warehouse. Also be informed that some items cannot be stored in the warehouse.zts8056e	Use the Production Center Structure to play the Mini Game for fun.zts8057e	You can receive various materials by earning Mini Game points. You can use the materials to craft powerful items.zts8058e	Isaac Martin (Armor Store)zts8059e	What do you want from me?zts8060e	What's resistance composition?zts8061e	Why don't young people today don't know such a simple thing? Tut, tut. I'll explain in simple terms.zts8062e	Combining numerous pairs of gloves or shoes into one is called Resistance Composition. Huh? What good does it do?zts8063e	You can combine a high defense item with a high resistance item to craft an item with high defense and resistance!zts8064e	You can combine up to 6 items at once, but the success rate decreases when you combine them too many. You'd better be careful because the items will disappear when you fail.zts8065e	Arnold Martin (Weapon Store)zts8066e	Huh? Do you want to ask me something?zts8067e	What's item upgrade?zts8068e	What's item gamble?zts8069e	Item upgrade? It's very simple. It's how you increase the level of your weapons and clothes.zts8070e	It can be upgraded from +1 to +10. The higher the level, the more useful it becomes.zts8071e	You won't notice any difference when you look at it, but you will see that your character became much more powerful in a battle.zts8072e	But you should be careful because the items will disappear when you fail.zts8073e	You still don't know what item gamble is? Oh boy. Okay, I'll be kind to explain it to you. You can use the gamble option to drastically increase the rare level of your weapons and clothes.zts8074e	It means you can turn a low level item into a 'Legendary' item. Huh? Did you just say it's great? Ha, ha! Of course there are downsides.zts8075e	Gambling is difficult. Its possible that I lose my grip and decrease the rare level.zts8076e	What's more, higher level items have a higher chance to fail. It's dangerous at times too because items can disappear when you fail. Don't blame me after losing an item later.zts8077e	Leika Cutlass (Boat to Frozen)zts8078e	Check boat schedule.zts8079e	Go to Frozen Crown.zts8080e	How to use the boat.zts8081e	I'm always grateful to you because you have helped us. It's a good time to travel safely. Are you getting on board.zts8082e	Okay, I'll ride the boat.zts8083e	Do you have a question?zts8084e	Where is this boat headed?zts8085e	When can I ride this boat?zts8086e	How much do I have to pay to ride this boat?zts8087e	You can't ride the boat or you didn't reach the island although you're on board the boat.zts8088e	I was in Frozen Crown, but I ended up in Brookhild when I connected to the game again.zts8089e	This boat crosses the ocean to go to Frozen Crown, a beautiful island of snow.zts8090e	I recommend only level 60 or higher players go to the world of snow because it's very cold and there are powerful monsters on the island.zts8091e	You can get on the boat at 5~25 minutes and 35~55 minutes after each hour.zts8092e	The boat also leaves at every hour or 30 minutes after each hour. You must wait on the boat even if you get on the boat earlier.zts8093e	The fare is 50,000 Gold. Please make sure you have the money before you get on the boat because you must pay the fare before the boat takes off.zts8094e	You must have enough gold to pay for the fare because the captain will kick you out of the boat if you don't have the gold even if you're already on board the boat.zts8095e	Up to 50 people can go on board the boat according to the property of the Power of Protection. Thank you for riding this boat, but I must think about the maximum capacity.zts8096e	Also, Frozen Crown Island is cursed with a powerful magic spell. If too many adventurers go there at once, the powerful magic spell will teleport you back to this place.zts8097e	That's probably why you cannot get on board the boat or go to the island.zts8098e	Frozen Crown Island is cursed with a powerful magic spell. If too many adventurers go there at once, the powerful magic spell will teleport you back to this place.zts8099e	You were teleported back to this place because there are too many adventurers.zts8100e	But don't worry. I can give you a boat ride for free just once.zts8101e	Leika Cutlass (Ride the Boat to Brookhild)zts8102e	Return to Brookhild.zts8103e	I'm always grateful to you for helping us. You can travel safely. Are you getting on board the boat?zts8104e	Lucas Frostwell (Choose a Camp)zts8105e	Obtain the Power of Protectionzts8106e	About the Power of Protectionzts8107e	Obtain the Power of Protection from Lateor's Egg. No one knows if you will obtain the power of Angel of Demon. Are you sure you want to obtain the Power of Protection?zts8108e	Yes, I'll obtain the Power of Protection.zts8109e	No, I'll do it later.zts8110e	Do you have a question?zts8111e	What's the Power of Protection?zts8112e	What do I need to obtain the Power of Protection?zts8113e	I want to have the same property as my friend!zts8114e	My property changed after joining a Family!zts8115e	Why did my property disappear?zts8116e	This is the power that separates Angel and Demon properties. Generally, the property of the Power of Protection does not change anything in East Mile.zts8117e	However, when you go to Frozen Crown Island, the two properties become opposing groups. There are no communication or cooperation, and only constant fights.zts8118e	That's why the ones who have obtained the Power of Protection must help each other in order to survive in Frozen Crown.zts8119e	Anyone can obtain the Power of Protection! However, you must be careful in obtaining it because once you obtain the power, its property cannot be changed until it's initialized.zts8120e	If you have joined a Family and one of the Family members obtain the Power of Protection, all the Family members receive the same power!zts8121e	Unfortunately, you cannot choose the property for the Power of Protection.zts8122e	When you're in a Family, all the Family members will have the same property. So you can always travel with your friend if you both join the same Family.zts8123e	Your property will change when you join a Family with a certain property. Also, your Power of Protection will disappear if you join a Family without a property.zts8124e	That's why you need to check the Family's property before joining a Family. So be very careful when you join a Family.zts8125e	Did your Power of Protection disappear? I think your property disappeared because of one of the two reasons.zts8126e	First, you have joined a Family without a property. Your Family's property takes priority over your property, so your property can disappear when you join a Family without a property.zts8127e	Second, the magical power of Frozen Crown may have taken away your Power of Protection. Please be informed that the magical power of Frozen Crown becomes even more powerful ever once in a while, and it's when all the properties are initialized.zts8128e	Lucas Frostwell (Frozen Conversation)zts8129e	Oh, it's really cold. I want to return to Brookhild as soon as possible and have a hot cup of cocoa.zts8130e	Yes, it's really cold.zts8131e	Alfred Sisley (Skill Store)zts8132e	Is there anything you want to know?zts8133e	Education is a skill that permanently increases your skill level.zts8134e	It's not free of course. You need to pay a certain amount of fee for the education, and you can learn the skill only when each of your combat skills reaches certain level.zts8135e	Education is divided into different grades such as Beginner and Intermediate. You don't have to complete the Beginner course before taking the Intermediate course.zts8136e	There is no difference in skill level between taking the Beginner and Intermediate courses one after another, and taking only the Intermediate course.zts8137e	The Base Skill is initiated by yourself before being used.zts8138e	You need a certain amount of Gold and CP in order to learn the Base Skill, and you need to reach the required Job Lv. for each skill.zts8139e	You can obtain CP every time your Job Lv. goes up. However, you will never have enough CP to learn all the skills. That's why you need to be wise when you choose a skill.zts8140e	You can learn up to four different types of Plus Skills for each Base Skill.zts8141e	You must be careful when you do this. You will see circle and square marks at the bottom right corner of the Plus Skill Icon, and you cannot learn the Plus Skills with the same mark.zts8142e	Education cannot be erased. You have nothing to lose because you didn't invest any CP in it.zts8143e	Hemi Ice Dust (Alchemy Store)zts8144e	You're as good as dead if you try to leave Frozen Heart Citadel without preparing yourself. Have all the necessary items ready in advance.zts8145e	Amelia Bellwood (Restaurant)zts8146e	Try my special ice cream! It's so delicious! Ice cream tastes better when it's cold!zts8147e	Leika Cutlass (Conversation NPC)zts8148e	Get off the boatzts8149e	Adventurer, what do you want to know?zts8150e	I want to know the current status of Frozen Crown.zts8151e	I'll come back when I have a question.zts8152e	Frozen Crown is currently in chaos because of some kind of great power. A war may break out at anytime.zts8153e	However, the Blue Magicians are trying to become strong enough to fight the great power with the help of many adventurers.zts8154e	It's not easy as it sounds, but I don't think it's impossible.zts8155e	Lucas Frostwell (Conversation NPC)zts8156e	I'm leaving for Frozen Crown in a moment. Do you want to ask me something?zts8157e	Why do I have to fight with other players with different property?zts8158e	How do I fill up the Power of Protection?zts8159e	What should I do after filling up the Power of Protection?zts8160e	Frozen Crown is cursed with two powerful magic spells. First, those without the Power of Protection are turned into a seal. Second, you must obtain one of the two types of Power of Protection, which are Light and Darkness. You don't get to choose one of the two properties.zts8161e	That's why players receive different Power of Protection. There is a restriction is a restriction on using the Power of Protection: Players with different Power of Protection cannot talk to each other. They can only fight with each other.zts8162e	Of course you don't hurt other players by fighting with them. You simply take away their Power of Protection so they're turned into a seal. You don't have to worry because they're turned into a seal. The Altar of Frozen Heart Citadel will break the curse and give them back the Power of Protection.zts8163e	Try collecting different types of Protection of Power. Then something will happen to the Central Barrier Tower. Be careful, because the guardian of the Central Barrier Tower might show up.zts8164e	Of course you can absorb the power from the adventurers with the Power of Protection of another property, or kill the monsters that became immune to the curse.zts8165e	This is somewhat unusual, but a powerful man sometimes show up to guard the Central Barrier Tower. His name is Lord Hisrant. He's a warrior from the Behimos Clan, and it's a mystery why he's there.zts8166e	According to Rudin Frozen Heart's investigation report, it's related to the Blue Magician traitor.zts8167e	When the Power of Protection of different property is accumulated so much that the Central Barrier Tower responds to it, the guardian of the tower will show up from west or east of Frozen Heart Citadel.zts8168e	We Blue Magicians have created a magic barrier so that the guardian can only come from a certain direction.zts8169e	When you defeat him, the Dimension Door will appear at the Central Barrier Tower to lead you to the Holders of the Seal who have been communicating with him.zts8170e	Great Wizard Fair Roshu (Conversation NPC)zts8171e	Welcome, adventurer. We Blue Magicians accept your help. So, how is your stay here?zts8172e	Of course I know it's not easy to get used to the cold. But I want you to know that we truly appreciate your help despite the cold weather.zts8173e	There will be many battles ahead. Take care of yourself.zts8174e	I'm the Great Wizard Fair Roshu. I'm in charge of Frozen Heart Citadel. Don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything.zts8175e	Rudin Frozen Heart (Conversation NPC)zts8176e	Hello, my name is Rudin Frozen Heart. I'm one of the Great Wizard Fair Roshu's students.zts8177e	I'm conducting a research on the great power that threatens us. I also tell the adventurers what they need to do.zts8178e	I've heard a lot about you. Leika Cutlass was so happy that you're here. Anyway, welcome to Frozen Heart Citadel.zts8179e	Warp Tower (Milano)zts8180e	Brookhild Town (2000 Gold)zts8181e	Warp Tower (Koaren)zts8182e	Warp Tower (Brookhild)zts8183e	Shell?

And if Sellbig heard this news, I will lose his faith!! I don't want to lose his faith! Never!!zts8204e	Sure, it is not free. If you bring 10 Pumpkin heads I will give a Halloween box to you. You will get one of cellons or some cute costume items from it. Would you help me??zts8242e	What kind of job would you like? You can not change what you decided.

If you did not change your class after Lv. 20, you will feel hard to go on the adventure.zts8248e	And if you change your class, you can no longer use the adventurer equipment that you currently have. Therefore you should take off all you equipped before changing the class.zts8249e	Instead, we will give you equipment that you can use at your level. It is not good but it is ok to use and useful to go on the adventure after changing your class.zts8250e	One more, you will automatically get a Power of Protection after changing the class.zts8251e	What is it?zts8252e	It is the Power of Angel or the Power of Devil. Sometimes it is needed to go on the adventure.zts8253e	It is not special. Just like permission.zts8256e	Would you like to change your class and get the Power of Protection?zts8257e	Yes, I will change itzts8258e	NO, I will come back in next timezts8577e	The fare is free. As soon as you take the ship, you can move to Brookhilld. Would you like to take it?zts12767e	Dialogues with Santa Clauszts12768e	Merry Christmas! I am too busy this Christmas, so I am looking for a person who can help me.
