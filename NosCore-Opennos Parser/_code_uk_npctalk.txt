zts1e	Teo's Tool Shopzts13e	See you later!zts14e	So, what would you like to know?zts15e	How can I improve my equipment?zts16e	What are the main advantages of upgrading my equipment?zts17e	How do I change my partner's equipment?zts18e	He looks just like you. Are you twins?zts19e	To upgrade your equipment, you will need some Cella Powder and Soul Gems.zts20e	Only weapons and armour can be strengthened, with improvements ranging from level 1 to level 10. The amount of Cella Powder required increases with each level.zts21e	Oh yes! I also charge a small transaction fee for that. That's about it. Understood?zts22e	Err... so how do I get Cella Powder and Soul Gems?zts23e	You get them by refining Gillion Stones.zts24e	These stones can be found everywhere and can be refined using Soul Gems.zts25e	Soul Gems can be fairly tricky to find, but Cella Powder is easy enough to come by.zts26e	If you are lucky, you might even find a Complete Soul Gem.zts27e	Thanks, I understand now.zts28e	By upgrading weapons and armour you can increase your attack and defence levels.zts29e	But I don't see any change, only an extra + symbol.zts30e	You've been cheated! Haha! No, don't worry, I'm only pulling your leg. You won't see any changes there.zts31e	In combat, your effective attack and defence are based on the difference between you and your opponent's levels.zts32e	But... how? (Is that true?!)zts33e	For example, your defence is calculated based on the difference between your opponent's weapon level and your armour level.zts34e	The greater the difference, the stronger you will be, so it's advisable to have high level equipment.zts35e	Ah! I get it now! Bah! (It's true!)zts36e	What would you like to see?zts37e	Please show me the weapons.zts38e	Please show me the armour.zts39e	Please show me the other equipment.zts40e	Partner equipment is the equipment which your partner can use.zts41e	To increase your partner's strength, you need to provide the right sort of equipment for them.zts42e	It's really easy to make equipment for your partner. You only have to ask me and I'll exchange any weapon or armour that you use for equipment for your partner.zts43e	If you decide to swap them, I'll convert the items into partner equipment of the same level. When converted, melee weapons stay melee weapons and vice versa.zts44e	If your partner uses melee attacks, they will need melee weapons and appropriate armour.zts45e	If your partner uses ranged attacks, they will need ranged weapons and equivalent armour.zts46e	For magic attacks, your partner will need magic weapons and the equivalent armour.zts47e	Who? That guy over there? Yeah, that's my twin brother.zts48e	In comparison to you, he doesn't look particularly hard-working.zts49e	Ha! No, he's pretty lazy. He is also very careless. I don't trust him and wouldn't give him any jobs.zts50e	Oh, by the way...zts51e	I heard that he has been doing something very strange with the equipment. Do not be fooled by his mysterious behaviour.zts52e	Really? Okay, I will take your advice.zts53e	Teo's Tool Shopzts62e	What can I use as a wager?zts64e	If you have any weapons or armour that don't have any unique properties, then show them to me!zts65e	I will use my divine powers to craft a rare item for you.zts66e	Really? Are you sure? But why is it called a bet?zts67e	Ah, that's because I occasionally make mistakes. That's why I can't guarantee the safety of the items.zts68e	Really? I don't understand.zts69e	Well, it doesn't happen often. And the chances of success are even better with a negative rarity level!zts70e	What happens if the rarity level is high?zts71e	To be honest, I'm not really sure...zts72e	As long as the item doesn't disappear when I touch it, it will receive a rarity level between 1 and 7.zts74e	NosCamp Infozts101e	End Dialoguezts102e	What do you want to know?zts104e	What's the difference between a standard mission and a record mission in Time-Spaces?zts119e	There's basically only one difference. When you start a mission, your score is based on your performance.zts120e	When you select a record mission, you attempt to beat the highest score any adventurer has set in the Time-Space.zts121e	What's the point of challenging the record? I don't see any benefit...zts122e	If you manage to break the record, your name will appear on the Time-Space Stone for all players to see. Isn't that awesome?zts123e	Rumour has it that Lord Cuarry is going to give large rewards to the players with the highest scores sometime in the future. And as an adventurer, your reputation is really important after all, right?zts124e	Don't you think everyone will go trying to break the records to get their names written large on the Time-Space Stones?zts125e	Well, challenging the record isn't free. It costs a certain amount of gold to make a challenge. If you aren't confident about being able to break the record, it would be a waste of time and money.zts126e	So think carefully before challenging any records.zts127e	If you aren't interested, there's no need to attempt to break any records.zts128e	Of course there is! Why are you behaving like such a coward? If you're a real adventurer, then take the challenge! It's what any brave adventurer would do.zts129e	Okay, I understand. I'll think about it.zts130e	May you have many wonderful adventures!zts131e	Which profession do you want to learn?zts132e	Swordsman. I want to be a master of melee combat.zts133e	Archer. I want to be a quick shot.zts134e	Mage. I want to dominate the battlefield with magical powers.zts135e	Once you change your profession, you can no longer use your Adventurer's equipment.zts136e	You should therefore remove all your equipped gear first. Instead, we will give you equipment that suits your new profession. Is that okay with you?zts137e	How good is the new equipment?zts138e	The equipment is quite good and will certainly prove useful to you in your new profession.zts139e	Okay, I understand.zts140e	Lord Cuarry is no longer supporting us and we've been left to pay the costs.zts141e	Do you want to change your profession?zts142e	Yes, I want to change my profession.zts143e	No, I will come back later.zts156e	A family is a community which you can form with other NosTale players. Be there for one another and share your greatest joys and terrible sorrows! That's what family is all about!zts157e	How can I help you?zts158e	I want to start a family.zts159e	I want to disband my family.zts160e	What do you need to start a family?zts161e	What commands can I use to manage my family?zts162e	Thanks for your help. See you later!zts163e	In order to found a family, you require three adventurers who have chosen a profession and completed Act 1-1.zts164e	These three players must be together in the same party. One of them should then come and talk to me with the necessary fee. Founding a family costs a one-time payment of 200,000 gold.zts165e	They then need to provide a name for the family. The player who applies to found the family and pays the fee becomes the Family Head. The other two party members become Family Deputies.zts166e	Also, I must apologise, but the family menu isn't complete yet, and certain functions are currently unavailable.zts167e	Please be patient. We are doing our best to help you as quickly as possible.zts168e	Okay, I understand.zts169e	Place a colon (:) in front of your message to use the family chat.zts170e	Place a percentage sign (%) in front of commands to use family commands in the chat box.zts171e	If you want to invite someone to your family, the Family Head or Family Keepers can type %Familyinvite followed by the character name.zts172e	There are two ways for a player to leave a family. The player can type the command %Familyleave to leave the family voluntarily. Or the Family Head can kick them from the family with the command %Familydismiss followed by the character name.zts173e	The Family Head and Family Deputies cannot be removed directly. Each person removed from a family must wait three days before they can join or found a new family.zts174e	A family needs a Family Head and two Family Deputies. To change the Family Deputies, use the command: %Familydeputy CurrentDeputy NewDeputyzts175e	If you want to pass on the position of Family Head to another player, they must first be in the position of a Family Keeper. You can then pass on the family with the following command: %Familyhead NewCharacterNamezts176e	Send messages to all family members using the command: %Notice yourMessage. They will receive your message as soon as they log into the game.zts177e	Even though the family system isn't perfect yet, I hope you have lots of fun and enjoy the experience with your family members.zts178e	We will add more useful functions as soon as possible.zts179e	NosVille Trainingzts191e	What do you want to know?zts192e	Tell me more about training.zts193e	What are basic skills?zts194e	What are plus skills?zts195e	How can I delete skills?zts196e	You can use training to learn a variety of passive skills which permanently increase your abilities in combat.zts197e	Training isn't free, of course, but costs a certain amount of gold. As soon as you have chosen a profession and reached a certain combat level, you can take a course.zts198e	How can I improve my combat level?zts199e	Every time you defeat a monster, you receive experience which increases your combat level. Training is divided into three levels: basic, intermediate and expert. However, it isn't necessary to complete the lower level before continuing with intermediate.zts200e	Are there any problems or disadvantages associated with this?zts201e	No. It doesn't really make any difference whether you take the training in order or start with the middle level.zts202e	However, it will be easier for you if you learn them in order.zts203e	Basic skills are those which you later use in combat.zts204e	Learning basic skills requires a certain amount of gold and CP. You also have to reach the corresponding job level.zts205e	What do you mean by CP and job level?zts206e	Your job level steadily improves when you kill monsters. Each time your job level increases, you receive CP, which are required for learning skills.zts207e	However you will never have enough CP to unlock and learn every skill. Choose your skills wisely!zts208e	Plus skills are special skills which improve your basic skills.zts209e	For example, take the basic skill Strong Hit. If you learn the plus skill Devious Strike as well, this will automatically be used every time you carry out a Strong Hit.zts210e	So the same skill can have different effects depending on which plus skill you learn?zts211e	Yes, exactly. You can learn up to four different types of plus skill for each basic skill.zts212e	There is however one restriction, and that being you cannot learn two plus skills bearing the same symbol. These symbols look like squares and circles and can be found in the bottom-right corner of the skills.zts213e	What do those symbols mean?zts214e	If you look in the skill window, you can see various slots with different symbols. These signs correspond to the slot where you must place a skill.zts215e	I see. Plus skills must go into the same slot as the symbol they possess, which is why you can only learn one type of plus skill per symbol.zts216e	If you learn a plus skill with a symbol that has already been occupied, the previous skill will be overwritten. Don't worry though. If you try to do this accidentally, you will receive a warning first.zts217e	If you no longer use a skill you have learned or need the CP to learn another skill, you can always delete the existing skill.zts218e	To delete an existing skill, double-click the skill you wish to delete in the skill learning window.zts219e	When you delete a skill, the CP that you spent on that skill will be refunded. However, you must pay the same fee in gold which you needed to learn the skill in the first place.zts220e	However, you can only delete basic skills once you have removed all related plus skills.zts221e	Skills learned through training cannot be deleted. However, since they don't cost any CP, you don't lose anything either.zts222e	Alchemy Associationzts233e	NosVille Marketzts257e	Fashion Boutiquezts266e	Okay, tell me.zts267e	Tell me something about accessories.zts268e	Accessories complement your outfit and are also an indication of your social standing.zts269e	But I guess you're more interested in their practical uses.zts270e	Accessories have surprising magical powers. You could say that magic seeped into the individual accessories when they were created.zts271e	They also feature option slots which can be used to give them additional powers.zts272e	Oh really? Could you explain that to me in more detail?zts273e	Ha! I knew that bit would whet your appetite! Okay, let me tell you some more.zts274e	Accessories have what are known as option slots and option levels.zts275e	The number of options you can use is dictated by the number of slots. Meanwhile the option level indicates up to which level this is possible. Are you with me so far?zts276e	I think so... but how can I add an option?zts277e	You will need a Cellon to add an option. Cellons are special shiny gemstones.zts278e	The level of Cellon you use is important for the level of the option. The higher the level of the Cellon, the better it is.zts279e	Ah, but you cannot choose which option you end up using. That is decided by fate and fortune alone.zts280e	Where can I get Cellons?zts281e	Cellons can be obtained by refining Gillion Stones. This process requires a Cellon Refiner.zts282e	The Refiner can be purchased from the Alchemy Association.zts283e	Time Circle (NosVille)zts285e	Enter the Unlimited Individual Arena!zts286e	Enter the Unlimited Family Arena!zts287e	View the Time Circle Listzts290e	Where do you wish to travel?zts291e	Western Mount Krem (1,000 Gold)zts292e	Manysales (Kovolt Town)zts294e	Mary's Luxury Goodszts297e	Kerbang Construction Office (Kovolt Town)zts299e	Shop (Kovolt Town)zts301e	Time Circle (Koaren)zts304e	NosVille (0 Gold)zts305e	Go to Time Circle.zts306e	Join the Arena and the Time Circle directly!zts307e	Act 1 - Introzts308e	Act 1 - The Tree of Fernonzts309e	Listen up, adventurer! I will give you your first mission:zts310e	Put a stop to the Kovolt riot!zts311e	The situation is getting worse day by day. This will only escalate into a war if we don't do something.zts312e	We need some real heroes to make sure that doesn't happen!zts313e	A new enemy appears and tries to stop you.zts314e	The resurrection of the Fernon Tree could throw the whole world into chaos!zts315e	Are you ready to take on this adventure?zts316e	But this is just the beginning...zts317e	Keep your wits about you. Many great adventures await!zts318e	Act 2 - Introzts319e	Together we were able to overcome the crisis.zts320e	But it is far from over yet! The Tree of Fernon may wake at any moment, but no one can say exactly when.zts321e	Since time immemorial, the mysterious Catsy tribe has safeguarded the seal of the Fernon tree.zts322e	However, the Kovolts and Catsies have been enemies for centuries.zts323e	If they start fighting again, it will end in a terrible war.zts324e	The crisis is far from over!zts325e	A new crisis is brewing on the horizon, and you'll have to go on many more adventures to avert it!zts326e	Act 2 - The Resurrection of the Devilszts327e	Get ready!zts328e	NosVille NPC Conversationzts329e	You're the rookie, aren't you?zts330e	Yes. However, I will do my best!zts331e	You have courage, but be warned that things don't always go as planned.zts332e	What do you mean? Are the Kovolts going to attack?zts333e	Well, the working conditions are terrible... the situation is dire...zts334e	Bah! You probably didn't treat them properly! Shall I teach them some manners?zts335e	Haha... You could do... but we need some more information.zts336e	What sort of information? Those lazy dogs are only going to moan again!zts337e	The Kovolts are protesting more severely than we thought, right?zts338e	Meanwhile the world seems to be slipping into chaos. It's a massive problem!zts339e	But it seems there must be good reasons for it.zts340e	What reasons? Those simpletons just love complaining all the time!zts341e	Will this war ever end?zts342e	Who will win out in the war between the humans and the Kovolts?zts343e	How did the situation get resolved so easily? I didn't think the Kovolts were so incompetent.zts344e	I never expected the war could end so easily. Who would have thought that the Kovolt could have internal troubles?zts345e	What will happen now? I'm so worried I can barely sleep.zts346e	We can't give up now. We have to give our all to the very last!zts347e	No! There is nothing more we can do now. They're much stronger than us!zts348e	Look at me! Why did I have to go through all this? Why did I have to suffer so much?zts349e	Great to see you! How's it going?zts350e	Hello! Be careful who you trust on your adventures. I wish you all the best!zts351e	Please! I beg you! Keep fighting for our village!zts352e	A strike? Damn! I hope nothing bad happens...zts353e	There is a growing sense of worry. Let's keep our spirits up though.zts354e	What a terrible situation!zts355e	Thanks for your hard work.zts356e	It's so depressing... I don't want to talk about it!zts357e	Excellent! You are my hero!zts358e	You remind me of my childhood.zts359e	What was I like back then? Was I really as foolish as you? Hahahaha!zts360e	Do you want to hear a funny story? *giggle*zts361e	Okay, this one time, at band camp...zts362e	*giggle*zts363e	Oh god, it's so funny I can't tell you any more now!zts364e	Welcome back! Do you remember what I was going to tell you about the other day?zts365e	Well I can tell you now. I'm sure I'll be able to hold back my laughter this time.zts366e	It was like this...zts367e	A long time ago there was a hamster with thorns...zts368e	...zts369e	Pfff...zts370e	Pfff... hahahaha... aaah, it's so funny how that thorny hamster got there! Hahahahaha!!!zts371e	Well, I'll continue the story some other time. Hahaha...zts372e	Don't lose heart, no matter how difficult the times ahead look!zts373e	To keep our spirits up, let me tell you a really funny story!zts374e	Hey! Where are you going? Don't you want to hear the rest of my story?zts375e	Hey...zts376e	A funny story, eh? Are you sure you want to tell me that story now?zts377e	Thank you for being so nice to me! To return your kindness, let me tell you a funny... Hey! Where are you going?zts378e	Today, I've got a special story ready for you, a story about Lanetan and the Tree of Fernon.zts379e	If they blow up, do they immediately turn into crisps? Hahaha...zts380e	Mwuhahaha...zts381e	Damn it! That isn't funny! What if I were to die?!zts382e	Well hello! That reminds me of a funny story!zts383e	What happens when a Lanetan explodes?zts384e	Give up? The answer is...zts385e	It turns into crisps! Isn't that hilarious? Hahaha...!zts386e	That's my funniest joke ever! Hahaha...zts387e	Hey, if you are just a rookie, you need to behave yourself. And you need to be quick!zts388e	Come on... why are you dawdling? Get a move on! Chop chop!zts389e	Filthy, noisy Kovolts!zts390e	What a day!zts391e	What will happen to NosVille now?zts392e	We're all going to die! This is the end! We're finished!zts393e	Come in! No one will believe me when I tell them that the two of us are friends. Give me your autograph so I can prove it!zts394e	The weather is beautiful and I don't have to do any work. Ah, this is the life!zts395e	Why haven't you joined the NosCamp? It isn't too late to join Lord Cuarry's Knights...zts396e	Stop whining! Be gone with you! I need to find out if the patrol is coming.zts397e	I am so annoyed! Why of all times must the Kovolts decide to go on strike now?!zts398e	Do something for god's sakes! Isn't this your duty?zts399e	Kovolts! Such noisy creatures!zts400e	Great job!zts401e	To make matters worse, this might even end in war!zts402e	How dare the Kovolts start fighting against the humans?! Haha!zts403e	Don't say anything. My life is over!zts404e	Loyalty! Everything is fine!zts405e	Conversation with Sluggzts406e	I've heard that some adventurers haven't returned from their adventures. They are still missing... Anyway, I wish you good luck!zts407e	Wow, you're still alive?! I guess it wasn't all that difficult then... Whatever the case, I wish you all the best!zts408e	I heard that you're better than the other adventurers. Don't let that go to your head though, okay?zts409e	What? You shouldn't be making a big fuss about that. Well, anyway...zts410e	The Adventurer's Sword bears the serial number NTR40U-10X. It offers some serious bang for your buck, which is why Teoman Topp has stopped making them.zts411e	We recommend you up use polyester cloth for polishing your sword, as the polyester produces cooling effects on the blade.zts412e	When you find yourself facing an enemy in leather armour, lift your sword and bring it down at an angle of 36.5 degrees. Our tests have shown that this is the optimal angle for slicing through leather.zts413e	There are two types of bow strings. The first type is made out of three strands twisted together twenty times. The second variety comprises five strands which are twisted together forty times. According to our research, the second type reduces the stress on the fingers by 0.2%, but nobody really feels the difference.zts414e	This gear? Bah, if you'd bought this when you bought the other tools, you'd have earned yourself a free gift.zts415e	Conversation with Mine Manager Mudogzts416e	Lord Cuarry's mines produce the largest volumes of Gillion Stones in the area. Everyone benefits from the industry.zts417e	Sometimes dogs bite the hand which feeds.zts418e	Kovolts! I wouldn't last long leading a life like theirs.zts419e	What kind of mad world are we living in nowadays? War with the Kovolts? Madness...zts420e	Is this really the right time to sit back and relax? I knew the Kovolts had something sneaky up their sleeves.zts421e	*hic* I got drunk to drown my sorrows. There is no joy in my life any more. Fernon's rotten roots won't kill us, will they? *hic*zts422e	The Kovolts worked hard too. A few days ago, Lord Cuarry rewarded a good Kovolt miner. The misunderstandings have been cleared up. Isn't that great?zts423e	Manager at Mine Entrancezts424e	Adventurer! I know it sounds ridiculous... but the Kovolts have thrown me out of the mines!zts425e	Why are they acting like this?zts426e	Isn't it your job to handle things like this, Adventurer? Do something!zts427e	What? A strike? What are they rambling on about?zts428e	They didn't exactly do nothing. Why do they say that? I hate having to live together with these Kovolts!zts429e	What? A war? Hahaha... mwahahahaha!!!zts430e	See? I knew this would happen. War? Even don't dream about it!zts431e	What a disaster! Who's going to clear up after this mess?zts432e	I've been treating my Kovolt friends pretty badly recently. I will try to be more generous toward them...zts433e	Koaren Guard 1zts434e	*woof* What do you human beings want here?zts435e	Come closer, human! You are our friend!zts436e	Koaren Guard 2zts437e	This is the beginning. Thank you!zts438e	Koaren Guard 3zts439e	The Koarens are very angry!

Just bring me the animal I want, alright?zts658e	Secret Mission 1 (Completed)zts659e	Excellent work! You can go now.zts660e	Don't ask any questions! Just bring me the animal I want, alright?zts661e	Protect Mount Krem 1 (Start)zts662e	Mount Krem is in chaos.zts663e	We need the help of adventurers to rescue the miserable Koaren tribe.zts664e	Protect Mount Krem 1 (Start)zts665e	The Koaren are very grateful to you. Thank you for your help.zts666e	Protect Mount Krem 2 (Start)zts667e	There are lots of scary monsters on Mount Krem. Please help us!zts668e	Protect Mount Krem 2 (Start)zts669e	Mount Krem is much safer again, thanks to your help <pname>!zts670e	Catsy Battle (Start)zts671e	The Darksies are a tribe of Catsies who support Kenel.zts672e	We have no choice but to fight them if we're to keep Mount Krem safe.zts673e	Please kill the Darksies dominating the Shanera Dungeon!zts674e	Catsy Battle (Completed)zts675e	You must have had a hard time dealing with the Darksies' magic. I'm very grateful for all your help!zts676e	There are many terrible things in this world, and the undead definitely fall into that category!zts677e	They're ugly as sin and don't have a thread of fashion sense! Truly disgusting!zts678e	I will reward whoever destroys the undead.zts679e	Oh! Thank you, <pname>! You dealt with everything. Would you like a little financial incentive now?zts680e	Time-Space Scenariozts681e	(You are overcome by a terrible feeling as you enter the Time-Space.)zts682e	(The air is humid and sticky. You find it difficult to breath.)zts683e	What's going on here?zts684e	Are you crazy? What on earth are you doing all the way down here?zts685e	There are traps everywhere you look!zts686e	This isn't the place for a greenhorn like you!zts687e	Wow, you put up a great fight! I didn't think you'd be capable of it.zts688e	Do you want to know how to get out of here?zts689e	You need to find and pull the right lever.zts690e	Only then will the door open. Now go, you'd better hurry!zts691e	Wow, you managed to make it this far? I'm impressed...zts692e	The lever is in the next room.zts693e	What are you waiting for? Get a move on!zts694e	The exit can't be much further now. And look, there's the lever!zts695e	Hopefully that was the lever for the door to the outside...zts696e	Time-Space Scenario 2zts697e	(There's an eerie silence in this Time-Space.)zts698e	It's quiet... almost too quiet! I have a bad feeling about this.zts699e	This place is terrifying. I'd better make sure I get out of here soon.zts700e	I can't seem to see a door anywhere.zts701e	Am I trapped in here?!zts702e	Ah, over there! A lever!zts703e	Oh no, what's that! The ground's beginning to shake! Feels like everything's about to collapse!zts704e	Let's get out of here!zts705e	There's no exit to this room. I'd better turn back quickly.zts706e	Finally, there's the exit!zts707e	Let's get out of here, before it's too late!zts708e	Time-Space Scenario 3zts709e	Hmm... two paths! One must be a trap.zts710e	I need to choose one of the paths.zts711e	I almost get the feeling that someone's playing tricks on me.zts712e	Two levers... and one of them is probably a trap.zts713e	If you don't make a decision, then the door will never open.zts714e	Gentle sunshine and sweet smells... and...zts715e	Time-Space Scenario 4zts716e	The demon servants are coming straight for me! Help!zts717e	Be careful! These demons are absolutely merciless. Look out, here they come!zts718e	It's not over yet.zts719e	We've almost made it. Now follow me!zts720e	We have to block the path that the monsters are coming through.zts721e	Pull the lever to open the exit.zts722e	Hurry! Pull the lever before it's too late!zts723e	Time-Space Scenario 5zts724e	(A ice-cold wind brushes past you sending shivers up your spine. You catch what you think sound like whispers in the air.)zts725e	The monsters are coming!zts726e	They're trying to escape from the Time-Space...zts727e	Something has startled them, they're in uproar!zts728e	(You see an injured person lying on the ground.)zts729e	Such a strange smell... but no time to be intimidated! I need to find out what's going on here.zts730e	A m... m... monster! A terrifying monster! It's coming this way...zts731e	Run away while you still can! Or you'll suffer the same fate all the other adventurers here fell to...zts732e	(He's passed out. And it doesn't look like he'll come to any time soon.)zts733e	You think you can stop me, you little worm?!zts734e	Argh! It's too strong! I cannot stop him!zts735e	Guard 1: Help the adventurer!zts736e	Guard 2: Time to teach this monster a thing or two!zts737e	Guard 3: Attack!zts738e	Guard 1: Victory is ours!zts739e	Guard 2: Ha! We showed him!zts740e	Guard 3: The monster is dead!zts741e	I've never seen a monster so strong before. Something weird is going on... but who's behind it all?zts742e	Time-Space Scenario 6zts743e	All the paths have been opened without any obvious reason.zts744e	The Time-Space gap is shaking. It looks like it might collapse at any moment.zts745e	We need to hurry!zts746e	Over there! I can see the lever!zts747e	Maybe that will lead to the way out.zts748e	(Once the battle is over, you discover the hidden exit.)zts749e	(It appears to be the only way out.)zts750e	Time-Space Scenario 7zts751e	Woah... such a strong wind. I can barely stay on my feet.zts752e	This Time-Space is extremely unstable. What's going on here?zts753e	I have to do something!zts754e	There's a small path over there... It's emitting some mysterious energy.zts755e	Could that be an exit?zts756e	Damn it! It's locked.zts757e	I bet there's a mechanism to open it around here somewhere.zts758e	I can see a big stone sculpture. Hm... maybe I should try moving that.zts759e	*The strong wind suddenly drops to a gentle breeze.*zts760e	A seal appears to have opened.zts761e	(A warm breeze strokes your cheeks.)zts762e	It's suddenly completely still... the seal has opened!zts763e	I should try to find the exit now!zts764e	The path is wide open.zts765e	Someone created this magical sculpture and curved this Time-Space. Whoever is responsible for this is playing with the lives of the people of this world.zts766e	I need to find him and put a stop to it!zts767e	Time-Space Scenario 8zts768e	Imps in a Time-Space?zts769e	We've found it!zts770e	Grab it! Don't let it get away!zts771e	Argh... we missed it!zts772e	It got away!zts773e	Damn... it's slipped away!zts774e	No! How did I miss it?!zts775e	Almost!zts776e	Please, help me!zts777e	Where are you?zts778e	Ah, there you are... I'm coming!zts779e	Darn! We'll get it next time!zts780e	Wait!zts781e	They're like greased lightning...zts782e	Thank you! You saved my life.zts783e	Are you alright?zts784e	I'll be fine... But these little monsters seem to be a serious threat. We have to wipe them out!zts785e	Then I'll hunt them down straight away!zts786e	I'll give you a hand!zts787e	Imp 1: Ha! That's what I was waiting for!zts788e	Imp 2: The enemies of my friend!zts789e	Let's kill them one by one.zts790e	Woah, that was close!zts791e	It's not over yet. Look over to the east!zts792e	A secret passageway appears in the east.zts793e	That's their base!zts794e	Time's running out. Hurry!zts795e	We'll deal with these pesky little terrors some other time!zts796e	Time-Space Scenario 10zts797e	(You hear a strange grinding noise!)zts798e	I have to find out what's happening here and do something about it. The world is in danger, I can feel it!zts799e	Are you here because of those strange noises? Then help me!zts800e	You have to close the seal, or these monsters will overrun NosVille!zts801e	What should I do?zts802e	Go and seal off the five paths. I'll help you to fight off the monsters!zts803e	All this chaos started because someone broke the seal.zts804e	(The grinding noise starts to recede!)zts805e	(But the Time-Space continues to quake!)zts806e	(The shaking continues unabated.)zts807e	(The grinding noise gets ever quieter)zts808e	(The grinding becomes even quieter)zts809e	Almost there!zts810e	(The grinding noise has stopped!)zts811e	(You have sealed off all the paths)zts812e	I can see the exit. Come on, let's get out of here.zts813e	Awesome job, you made it!zts814e	Thanks, you were a great help. What's your name?zts815e	The name's Bob. I teach martial arts in NosVille.zts816e	The outbreak of chaos led me here.zts817e	Wait! Look out!zts818e	Thank you for saving me! I think we're finished here.zts819e	I should really be getting back to NosVille. So long!zts820e	I hope we'll meet again under different circumstances.zts821e	Bob is a very brave man. Sadly, guys like him are a rare sight these days.zts822e	I feel like something ominous is waiting for us.zts823e	Time-Space Scenario 11zts824e	The guards seem to be very nervous.zts825e	They don't appear to be particularly thrilled with their mission...zts826e	Maybe I should have a word with them.zts827e	Guard 1: The Kovolts are rioting!zts828e	Guard 2: This mission doesn't suit me one little bit. The Kovolts have tricked us into their ambush often enough already.zts829e	Guard 3: I wish I was back home in my bed!zts830e	Guard 4: When this mission is finally over, I'm going to quit and find a new job!zts831e	The defensive lines have been broken!zts832e	Let's get down there and round up some miner prisoners!zts833e	Expy Miner 1: You're just Lord Cuarry's lackeys!zts834e	Expy Miner 2: You'll pay for your crimes!zts835e	Expy Miner 1: Why are you attacking us?zts836e	Expy Miner 2: We did nothing wrong!zts837e	Expy Miner 3: This is all Lord Cuarry's fault!zts838e	The miners appear to be exhausted.zts839e	Can we really blame the miners for all this?zts840e	Time-Space Scenario 12zts841e	The monsters have started their attacks.zts842e	No one can guarantee your safety.zts843e	If you're afraid, you should probably turn back now!zts844e	We don't have time for cowards here, we need real warriors!zts845e	And that's coming straight from the Captain of the NosVille Guards.zts846e	We must retreat! It would be useless to continue this fight!zts847e	The NosVille Guards have been absolutely decimated.zts848e	The situation in NosVille and around the Fernon Outpost is more chaotic and dangerous than ever before.zts849e	What should we do now?zts850e	These are difficult times. Every adventurer must prepare themselves for some tough challenges ahead!zts851e	Time-Space Scenario 13zts852e	Looks like a major battle took place here. But there's no sign of Bob.zts853e	I'll have to keep searching. Bob must be around here somewhere!zts854e	The monsters have been completely annihilated...zts855e	That's why it's so quite now.zts856e	Do you know where Bob is?zts857e	The last time I saw him, he was being chased by some monsters.zts858e	That was the last room, and there's no one here either.zts859e	But Bob must be around here somewhere!zts860e	Maybe I should try using this lever.zts861e	Finally! There's Bob!zts862e	He's surrounded by monsters!zts863e	I have to help him!zts864e	You saved me! Thank you!zts865e	The monsters lured me into a trap...zts866e	Are you alright?zts867e	Yes, I'm fine. I need to go back now and hunt some more of those monsters.zts868e	Do you think that's really such a good idea? You were lucky this time round, but next time... hey, where are you going?zts869e	There he goes, running off, pretending not to hear anything... That guy drives me mad!zts870e	Why can't he stay still for one minute?zts871e	Time-Space Scenario 14zts872e	A group of Kovolts are making ready to attack!zts873e	The Kovolts are confronting Lord Cuarry's Knights.zts874e	I'm sure Krispo is trapped somewhere around here.zts875e	I need to break through the Kovolts' defences and find Krispo!zts876e	Oh no, the entrance has caved in!zts877e	It's very dim and murky down here... oh look, there's Krispo! Good job he's still alive.zts878e	There you are, Krispo! I'm here to rescue you!zts879e	*cough*zts880e	Come on, let's go.zts881e	*cough* There's nothing I'd love to do more, but there's a little problem... the entrance has caved in!zts882e	We're stuck here!zts883e	Oh, look here! There's a gap in the wall, we should be able to squeeze through here.zts884e	*out of breath* I can't go on. I'm so tired... I give up! Go on without me!zts885e	Finally, there's the exit! Come on, we've nearly made it. I'm not leaving you behind now!zts886e	Time-Space Scenario 16zts887e	This land is full of fear and hatred!zts888e	Is this the home of the demons? I could just as well be in hell itself!zts889e	Soldiers of Hellord! Come to me!zts890e	The way out is open!zts891e	Oh no, an unsealed pathway! And the demon armies are coming through it!zts892e	We must seal the pathway!zts893e	Who dares to disturb me?zts894e	Time-Space Scenario 17zts895e	No monsters in sight!zts896e	Someone must have eliminated them.zts897e	I wonder if that was Tom the knight?zts898e	Well, well, well. What do we have here? A silly little adventurer!zts899e	I will forgive you this time.zts900e	But you'd better not come to my hunting place again!zts901e	Are you ignoring my warning?zts902e	I was careless? We'll soon see about that...zts903e	You again! Just you wait, you don't deserve any better!zts904e	I will never forget the insult I got today!zts905e	Hey, I don't have any intention of fighting you!zts906e	You are so arrogant! One day you will regret that!zts907e	Time-Space Scenario 18zts908e	Those dour knights are bound to refuse me entry.zts909e	This place must hide a secret, that much is clear!zts910e	Knight 1: Keep out!zts911e	Knight 2: Get out of here!zts912e	Knight 3: Don't come any closer!zts913e	Knight 1: Are you ignoring our warning?zts914e	Knight 2: You aren't allowed in here!zts915e	(Lord Cuarry's Knights are barring your way. You'll have to find another route!)zts916e	(This room is filled with a terrible stench.)zts917e	Something's coming... something dangerous!zts918e	We're not going to put up with you poking your nose around here any more!zts919e	Leave here right now!zts920e	T... Tom!zts921e	I don't want to have to bury you here.zts922e	I'm a knight, so just do what I say! Run for it! Run as fast as you can!zts923e	But all the exits are blocked. There's no way out!zts924e	Then come over here.zts925e	Tom whispers something and a secret path opens up.zts926e	Time-Space Scenario 19zts927e	You again? I don't have time to play silly games. I'll see you later.zts928e	There are too many enemies. Run away!zts929e	No! I'll help you.zts930e	You're insulting my honour. Get out of my face!zts931e	You look pretty rough.zts932e	(Tom gets a pill from his pocket and puts it in your hand. It will make you feel better.)zts933e	Don't worry, I won't laugh. You had to put up with a lot.zts934e	You're a brave warrior with a big heart. You've earned my respect.zts935e	But you also insulted my honour, and one day you will pay for that!zts936e	Time-Space Scenario 20zts937e	Please save us!zts938e	Where's that voice coming from?zts939e	I'm down here, in the cellar! The demons captured me during the battle.zts940e	Demons? What demons?zts941e	Yes! The demons running riot all over the place.zts942e	But why?zts943e	Free me and I'll tell you more. Please, let's get out of here!zts944e	Alright. What do I need to do?zts945e	There's some kind of mechanism which gives you access to the cellar. Use that and you can set us free!zts946e	Alright, just hold on!zts947e	Be on your guard! There are monsters literally everywhere around here.zts948e	Hmm... there's a big lever in the middle there. Maybe that's what activates the mechanism?zts949e	Looks like it worked. I should get back to that room.zts950e	Wow, you managed it!zts951e	Yes, fortunately!zts952e	We should make tracks before any more monsters appear. Hurry!zts953e	What's going on here exactly?zts954e	Have you noticed how there are more and more Time-Space Stones appearing around NosVille? Somehow, these monsters can control them. But sadly I don't know what exactly they're planning...zts955e	What do you mean?zts956e	Well, I overheard some of their conversations. You know about that Kovolt strike, right? It appears these monsters had a hand in it!zts957e	What? That's madness! But why? Why on earth would they come here to both the people?!zts958e	Unfortunately, I can't say. But we need to hurry! Not even the two of us together have a hope of standing against all those monsters.zts959e	Time-Space Scenario 21zts960e	There you are. About time we settled our old feud!zts961e	I'll wait for you in the final room of the Time-Space!zts962e	Feel my sword!zts963e	You have beaten me. Please, give me an honourable end!zts964e	Hey, haven't you ever realised that we could be friends, you and I?zts965e	???zts966e	There's no reason for us to fight.zts967e	Of course there is! I'm a great warrior, my honour compels me to fight you. Now finish it!zts968e	No, I can't do that!zts969e	You insult me! I will never forget this!zts970e	Tom's disappeared. I hope I made the right decision.zts971e	Time-Space Scenario 22zts972e	Attack! Kill the Kovolts!zts973e	No one can defeat us!zts974e	Shut up and taste my sword!zts975e	We'll be back! We'll never be defeated! Never!zts976e	Knights' Captain: We shall destroy all these Kovolts, the miners and Koaren alike! Well fought, men! Victory belongs to Lord Cuarry!zts977e	All Knights: Glory to Lord Cuarry!zts978e	Knights' Captain: Let us return triumphant!zts979e	What's going on here? Where's your pride?zts980e	We obey Lord Cuarry's orders unconditionally. His word is our command!zts981e	But he wants to lead the demons here!zts982e	The demons are creatures of darkness and destruction. They will send this world to oblivion!zts983e	We cannot allow them to invade.zts984e	Don't be such a fool! We can make use of these demons.zts985e	They may be creatures of destruction, but that's irrelevant. They give us power, that's what matters!zts986e	The Kovolts are getting stronger by the day. We cannot defeat them alone.zts987e	There's only one law for us: Lord Cuarry's! If you don't obey him, then...zts988e	Then what?zts989e	Then you are a traitor!zts990e	I was already a warrior, long before I joined Lord Cuarry's knights. I listen to my conscience and nothing more.zts991e	Attack the traitor!zts992e	Argh!zts993e	Are you okay?zts994e	Why are you helping me?zts995e	Because I think we could be friends.zts996e	Friends?! You're no friend of mine. I can't stand you!zts997e	I've noticed. But it doesn't have to stay that way.zts998e	When you rescued me, my warrior's pride disappeared forever, leaving my body behind like an empty shell. I don't even deserve to be avenged. From now on, I belong to you. It's the only way I will find peace.zts999e	What are you trying to say?zts1000e	From now on I will fight alongside you. I will be your loyal companion for the rest of my days.zts1001e	Time-Space Scenario 24zts1002e	(The battle is in full flow. The NosVille Guards and Korrkoaren's troops are embroiled in a bitter struggle.)zts1003e	To battle! Attack!!!zts1004e	Cut them all down!zts1005e	Retreat!!!zts1006e	The enemy is retreating. Chase them down!zts1007e	Argh!zts1008e	Stand firm!zts1009e	Ahhhhhhh...zts1010e	We must retreat! It's too dangerous here!zts1011e	Knights' Captain: It's time to attack the Kovolts! Follow me!zts1012e	Knight: Attack!!zts1013e	Knights' Captain: We shouldn't let those pathetic NosVille guards get in our way!zts1014e	Guard 1: Where did all these demons come from?zts1015e	Guard 2: They came with Lord Cuarry's Knights!zts1016e	Guard 1: But that's madness! Lord Cuarry can't have allied himself with the demons just to beat the Kovolts!zts1017e	Lord Cuarry really has allied himself with the demons. But the Kovolts are only protesting against the poor working conditions in the mines. I'm starting to feel like I don't know who my real enemies are.zts1018e	Time-Space Scenario 25zts1019e	(An ominous calm prevails here, like the calm before the storm. You feel like something is about to happen.)zts1020e	Ha! I've got you!zts1021e	Time-Space Scenario 26zts1022e	Knights' Captain: We won't stop fighting until the last Kenko has been defeated!zts1023e	Knights (in unison): God save Lord Cuarry!zts1024e	You buffoons! You'll never defeat us! Stop fooling yourselves!zts1025e	Crush them all!zts1026e	Haha! You've walked into our little trap. Now you'll feel the brunt of our burning rage. Attack my Kenko brothers!zts1027e	Argh!!! Retreat! Quickly!zts1028e	Stop! Put your sword away!zts1029e	*grrrr* Get out of the way!zts1030e	Hey! Lord Cuarry made a pact with you. You are our allies! Why don't you finish off these pathetic barbarian Kenkos?zts1031e	We demons are nobody's friends.zts1032e	But what about our alliance?zts1033e	We respect the pact with Lord Cuarry, but our father, the greatest of all demons, does not want this war. So put your sword away!zts1034e	What? You demons dare to get in my way again?!zts1035e	Lower your weapons! This battle is over!zts1036e	You filthy demons!zts1037e	Time-Space Scenario 28zts1038e	We need to keep quiet and keep a low profile. Don't start any fights. Let's take a closer look at those guards.zts1039e	This is the Kenko office. The Kenkos and the demons are discussing something. Let's listen in to their conversation.zts1040e	Demons! Why are we here?zts1041e	Do not interrupt the conflict between Lord Cuarry and the Koarens.zts1042e	Why should I listen to you? I'm not interested in cooperating with humans.zts1043e	Once the agreement has been signed and the war is over, I promise you new lands.zts1044e	*grrrr* New land?zts1045e	The land belonging to NosVille.zts1046e	What?! Are you serious?zts1047e	For us powerful Demons, NosVille is a trifling matter.zts1048e	Why... why do you want to stop me from helping the Koaren?zts1049e	What are you worrying about now?zts1050e	You're right. I don't care what the reason is. Okay, agreed! I will sell my soul.zts1051e	Time-Space Scenario 29zts1052e	Attack! Attack!zts1053e	Stand firm!zts1054e	Sons of the northern winds! Time to pull back!zts1055e	Kovolt 1: The Kenko soldiers are retreating!zts1056e	Kovolt 2: The Kenkos are betraying the Koaren!zts1057e	Don't be afraid! Fight until the last!zts1058e	Re... retreat!!zts1059e	Guard: Go and catch Korrkoaren! Kill all runaways!zts1060e	Knight 1: The Koaren forces have been defeated!zts1061e	Knight 2: Korrkoaren... has he fled the field?zts1062e	Time-Space Scenario 30zts1063e	Public Notice: Anyone who kills Koaren will be rewarded with 10,000,000 gold! - Lord Cuarryzts1064e	Did you follow me here?zts1065e	It's over! Just surrender!zts1066e	Hahaha... Is that what I get for trusting a traitor?zts1067e	Just give up! All the Kovolt soldiers are dead!zts1068e	Hah... I know... but I cannot betray my people for one life.zts1069e	Then I cannot help you!zts1070e	The demon minion, bring him to me!zts1071e	!!!zts1072e	I can't make compromises with someone who would sell their soul to the demons! Come on!zts1073e	No!!!zts1074e	That voice... can it really be?! Kenel!zts1075e	Korrkoaren is bathed in a glow of white light before suddenly disappearing. It's the Wing of Return!zts1076e	I've never heard of Kovolts using Wings of Return before!zts1077e	Time-Space Scenario 31zts1078e	*wheeze*zts1079e	Stop following the master!zts1080e	He disappeared. I can't just let him go like that!zts1081e	I thought I told you not to follow us!zts1082e	Wait a second! I just want to ask something.zts1083e	What an idiot!zts1084e	You are so stubborn!zts1085e	I'm begging you. Please, give me more time.zts1086e	I have a bad feeling about this. That's a huge number of demons. Will the tired Korrkoaren be in any condition to fight them?zts1087e	Demons! The tired Korrkoaren and Kenel are being attacked by demons!zts1088e	Hey!zts1089e	*cough* It seems to be getting worse!zts1090e	I won't attack you now. Let's get rid of these demons!zts1091e	Why are you helping us?zts1092e	Korrkoaren!!!zts1093e	I want to ask you something.zts1094e	You are so... impertinent!zts1095e	Kenel, stop! Hey, human, you saved my life! I owe you one. For that, I will answer your question. What is it?zts1096e	What kind of agreement exists between Lord Cuarry and the demons?zts1097e	Please, tell me.zts1098e	Don't you know?zts1099e	Master! Don't trust these humans!zts1100e	In a nutshell, Lord Cuarry has sold Mount Krem to the demons. We have lived there for more than 100 years. It's our home. Now there's nowhere left for us to return to.zts1101e	!!zts1102e	In return, Lord Cuarry has the right to mine the lands to the north of Kreano.zts1103e	Really?zts1104e	Are you sure you didn't know that already?zts1105e	Kenel, stop it! Can't you see these humans don't care that we were evicted from our land in Mount Krem?zts1106e	??zts1107e	We have been fighting for our very survival. You humans don't know anything!zts1108e	I'm sorry, I thought it was an attack.zts1109e	For the last 100 years, we have been working very hard under terrible conditions. And you? You humans just take that for granted. But never mind... That's all over now... No need for you to be sorry. Just go back home!zts1110e	Forget it, go away, humans!zts1111e	Kenel! We are going to the Kenkos. We have to find out the reason why they were betrayed.zts1112e	Time-Space Scenario 35zts1113e	Someone is watching us. Just be careful!zts1114e	Can you feel that? The tension in the air? We must be careful.zts1115e	Maybe it's a trap, but I can't see any evidence for that. Still, my intuition says we should get out of here.zts1116e	It's too quiet... too calm. It feels like we're being set up... What if my gut feeling is right?zts1117e	Stop! Stop them all!zts1118e	*wheeze*zts1119e	Humans! They exploited and tortured us!zts1120e	We should kill them!zts1121e	No! They are not our enemies. Our true enemies are Lord Cuarry's Knights and the NosVille guards. There's no need to tar them all with the same brush and make them all our enemies. We are only few in number.zts1122e	Really?zts1123e	Okay... then we will stop it!zts1124e	You humans can go back! It's okay!zts1125e	When I said you should leave, I meant it.zts1126e	I just wanted to thank you.zts1127e	That isn't necessary. There's no feeling of hostility between us, but that doesn't make us friends. Anyway, humans can't get along with Kovolts. Whether you choose to remain here or not, that's your decision. But keep in mind that I can't guarantee for your safety.zts1128e	Oh... I understand.zts1129e	And never, ever come back... This is the Kovolts' final bastion. The smell of humans gets us agitated!zts1130e	Time-Space Scenario 36zts1131e	Help us! Please, help us!zts1132e	Didn't I tell you to go away?zts1133e	Wait! I want to ask you something!zts1134e	I have absolutely no intention of answering any of your questions. Go away. I have enough on my plate with this internal conflict.zts1135e	Why are you helping us?zts1136e	Because it looks like you need the help.zts1137e	Kenel! What brings you here?zts1138e	You again!zts1139e	Kenel, the enemy has retreated.zts1140e	Excellent work!zts1141e	But this adventurer is...zts1142e	You're back again, I see.zts1143e	You already know each other?zts1144e	Kenel, let me ask you a question.zts1145e	What do you want to know?zts1146e	Do you trust the humans?zts1147e	No, I certainly don't.zts1148e	Then how come you're willing to accept this adventurer?zts1149e	Kenel?zts1150e	Please, tell me. I trust your judgement.zts1151e	This adventurer may have the pathetic body of a human being, but they have the heart and soul of a Kovolt!zts1152e	!!!zts1153e	I see. Then I shall also believe in the brave soul of the Kovolt within!zts1154e	Thank you!zts1155e	We will meet again.zts1156e	You look like you're in a hurry. What's the rush?zts1157e	The Kenkos have been behaving strangely of late. I need to find out why.zts1158e	Time-Space Scenario 37zts1159e	The Kenko base... but something here is amiss. The stench of demons hangs in the air. This doesn't look much like a camp for Kenko elite troops.zts1160e	Help me! Help us!!!zts1161e	Get out of here, you demons!zts1162e	I will destroy everything!zts1163e	The Kenko soldiers look like they've gone crazy... What happened here? Uh-oh, look out! They're attacking in this direction!zts1164e	I don't want to fight. Let's get out of here!zts1165e	And what exactly am I supposed to change about that?zts1166e	If you want to kill me, then do it! I can't go on living like this.zts1167e	What brings you here?zts1168e	I get the impression that the Kenkos are acting strangely...zts1169e	The Kenkos have gone insane. They must have been poisoned or fallen under some kind of spell. I don't know any more than that.zts1170e	Attack!zts1171e	Attack!!zts1172e	Enemies! We'll talk later!zts1173e	You go. Get away from here. I need to look around here a bit more.zts1174e	Understood. Be careful!zts1175e	I never expected to hear words like that from a human... Feels good, somehow. Anyway, you take good care too!zts1176e	Time-Space Scenario 38zts1177e	You have some nerve! Coming here as if nothing happened!zts1178e	I could say the same for you!zts1179e	Hah! I don't like you, but at least you're not completely useless.zts1180e	I could say the same thing about you!zts1181e	Fine. Since we're both here already, we might as well work together. Let's go to the Kenko office. Maybe we'll find some clues there.zts1182e	What's that?zts1183e	It's a military report! Might be useful. We should probably examine it more closely.zts1184e	Report: The Fernon tree has been damaged successfully. The gas emitted from the tree has poisoned a large number of soldiers. They now request to brought to a safe location.zts1185e	The Fernon tree.zts1186e	What's that?zts1187e	So they had their sights on the Fernon tree?zts1188e	But what is it?zts1189e	Human, take this report and get out of here!zts1190e	Grab them!zts1191e	The Kenkos are coming!zts1192e	Psst! Keep quiet and hide!zts1193e	Fernon will be unleashed soon, but we'll have to deal with the consequences as well.zts1194e	Many soldiers have already been poisoned to death. But that's all been kept quiet.zts1195e	Once the seal is broken, every living creature on Mount Krem will die.zts1196e	We aren't going to help you get us all killed!zts1197e	The people of NosVille will die, and the Koarens will die with them. Then NosVille and all the mines will be yours.zts1198e	I've already betrayed my species. I'm not going to lead them to their doom!zts1199e	When Fernon awakens, the heavens will be rent asunder, the land will be divided, and a great portal will be open for Hellord's demons. Hellord will never forget you. But first, you must make this small sacrifice. So survive! We will respect everyone who survives.zts1200e	Grrr... I refuse to have anything more to do with this unethical deal!zts1201e	We'll keep to our agreement. We promised to you the mines of NosVille, not your life!zts1202e	And what if I stop cooperating?zts1203e	If you don't keep to the bargain, you will die. We'll simply find ourselves a new partner.zts1204e	Are you serious?zts1205e	Kovolts of Kreano! Your land will soon belong to the demons... You pathetic creatures are powerless to stop this from happening, nor will you be able to withstand it. But we promise you new lands. Just keep to your promise. We will give the land of NosVille over to all who survive. For the glory of Hellord!zts1206e	We have no choice.zts1207e	It's pointless to talk about the old agreement. Instead, we should probably talk about the deal we just made.zts1208e	What is it?zts1209e	Someone has been listening in on our conversation.zts1210e	Who's there?zts1211e	They've found me!zts1212e	We will continue to fight to the end!zts1213e	No! I'll deal with them. Go and tell Kliff what we learned here!zts1214e	But...zts1215e	We can't risk both of us falling into their hands! Hurry!zts1216e	Kenel!!!zts1217e	If we should survive this, we'll meet again!zts1218e	Time-Space Scenario 40zts1219e	This is the first energy stream. Hurry!zts1220e	Okay!zts1221e	Excellent, here it is. Take the seal.zts1222e	Time-Space Scenario 41zts1223e	This is the second energy stream. Hurry!zts1224e	Time-Space Scenario 42zts1225e	This is the third energy stream. Be quick!zts1226e	Time-Space Scenario 43zts1227e	This is the fourth energy stream. Hurry!zts1228e	We did it! The Fernon tree has stopped growing!zts1229e	Is that it?zts1230e	No, that will only stop the growth temporarily. As soon as we leave, the energy stream will move and continue to encourage growth in another form.zts1231e	What needs to be done then?zts1232e	We must attack the tree's trunk. Since it has stopped growing, it will be weaker now. The perfect time to attack!zts1233e	Okay, I'll do my best. I'll attack it!zts1234e	This way! Just keep going, don't fight any enemies you encounter.zts1235e	Yes, we've almost made it! Keep going, this way!zts1236e	Even more enemies...zts1237e	Dryads, the tree of Fernon's imps.zts1238e	Enemy of Fernon, you will pay for your resistance with your life!zts1239e	May Fernon's curse hang over you forever!zts1240e	Fernon! Please accept the blood of these sacrifices!zts1241e	Fernon! Open your eyes!zts1242e	Argh! There's too many of them!zts1243e	I didn't know there would be so many!!zts1244e	I can't hold out much longer...zts1245e	Let's get out of here! There's no use in dying here!zts1246e	But... I can't move... I just can't... I'm sorry!!zts1247e	Now, now, young friend! Are you giving up so easily?zts1248e	Where's that voice coming from?zts1249e	Just leave! Go!zts1250e	Suddenly, everything around you turns white.zts1251e	*grrr*zts1252e	Ahhh!!!zts1253e	Miner 1: That scoundrel Lord Cuarry must apologise!zts1254e	Miner 2: No more exploitation!zts1255e	Miner 3: Ahh! Humans!zts1256e	Uh-oh! I have a feeling things could get ugly!zts1257e	Miner 1: Do you work for Lord Cuarry?zts1258e	Miner 2: If you do, that makes you our enemy!zts1259e	Wait! Let me explain!zts1260e	Miner 1: Lord Cuarry's henchmen are here!zts1261e	Miner 2: Let's get out of here before they catch us!zts1262e	Hold on! Wait!zts1263e	Expy Miner: Pah! You can't deceive us with your cheap tricks!zts1264e	Just listen to me a moment! I can explain everything!zts1265e	Expy Miner: Promise you aren't going to drive us away.zts1266e	Calm down now... Go back to your jobs, and I'll forward your concerns to Lord Cuarry. Your situation will soon improve!zts1267e	Expy Miner: You can't be serious. You don't believe that do you?! Pahahaha! Hahahahaha!!zts1268e	Expy Miner: We won't be lied to any more! Lord Cuarry never listens to our problems. He'd rather just dispatch the troops to suppress my brothers.zts1269e	Well, that's because...zts1270e	Expy Miner: You're no better! My brothers! Seize that scoundrel!zts1271e	Expy Miner: Bah... he's too strong... Brothers! Retreat!!!zts1272e	Expy Miner: That's one tough chestnut! But we will never give up!zts1273e	Expy Miner: So you've been following me... Ha! Do you think this will all be over if you can capture me? Don't make me laugh, hahaha! This may be the end of me, but my brothers will continue the fight!zts1274e	Expy Miner: Grrr... You're driving me insane!zts1275e	Why do you fight so tenaciously?zts1276e	Expy Miner: They treat us so badly... It's exasperating...zts1277e	Expy Miner: Leave me in peace and get out of here... My time is up... But my brothers will never give in!zts1278e	Hello! So, we meet again.zts1279e	Great to see you again, Bob!zts1280e	I wish we were meeting under other circumstances.zts1281e	What's wrong?zts1282e	I'm always ready to take responsibility for protecting our friends from evil! But are the Kovolts really our enemies?zts1283e	I'm not sure... I understand your concerns.zts1284e	Yes, the Kovolts toil and sweat in the mines for the people. We ought to listen to their demands rather than fighting them!zts1285e	But why don't they try to talk to us?zts1286e	Do you think it was always like this? No, they already tried to cooperate with the humans, but they weren't allowed to enter the towns.zts1287e	I honestly wanted to hear their story... but they just...zts1288e	The Kovolts don't trust humans any more. A few days ago, when they brought a letter to Lord Cuarry, his knights snatched the letter and beat them up.zts1289e	Really? I don't believe it.zts1290e	You see? It's no wonder that poor lot have raised arms against us.zts1291e	???zts1292e	*thinking* I'm just not sure we're doing the right thing... (He dispels his doubts.) Well, whatever, let's go! After all, I came here to end their strike, once and for all!zts1293e	Miner 1: Here come the NosVille guards!zts1294e	Miner 2: Attack them!zts1295e	That's... that's not fair. I can't continue!zts1296e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Hey, Bob!zts1297e	I don't want to have anything more to do with this! There's absolutely no point! Why on earth are we fighting the Kovolts? WHAT FOR?!zts1298e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: We'll deal with that later. Right now, they're coming! It's time to fight or die!zts1299e	Miner 1: Hold the line, my brothers!zts1300e	Miner 2: We have to hold our ground at any cost, or everything is lost! Fight like heroes! Let's fight so people still remember the Kovolt name in a thousand years! For freedom! ATTACK!zts1301e	The Kovolts are surrounded by the NosVille guards. They look very tired and scared.zts1302e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Take them prisoner!zts1303e	No!zts1304e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: I have command here. What do you think you're doing?zts1305e	This fight is dishonourable! Just look who our enemies are. If we do this, we'll only lost people's respect!zts1306e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Silence! Or do you want to be our first prisoner?zts1307e	No!!!zts1308e	Argh!zts1309e	If you want to arrest Bob, then you'll have to arrest me first.zts1310e	Guard 1: Hmm... Captain!zts1311e	Guard 1: Bob's right. I'm siding with him. Arrest me, too!zts1312e	Guard 2: I'm with them. This mission is immoral. The Kovolts haven't done anything wrong!zts1313e	Guard 3: What the hell are we doing here? Let's just go home, sir!zts1314e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: You can't be serious?zts1315e	You've heard what the men want!zts1316e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Maybe you're right... (He considers for a moment.) Maybe... what we're doing here isn't right. Let's return home.zts1317e	He understands! Thank the heavens!zts1318e	Let's get out of here. I'm so happy everything ended up for the best. I feel great!zts1319e	Wait!zts1320e	Yes?zts1321e	I'd like to say thank you.zts1322e	That's not necessary. I was really impressed with you!zts1323e	So where are you planning to go now?zts1324e	Wherever my heart takes me.zts1325e	Let me come with you!zts1326e	What? Really?zts1327e	Sure! I never want to lose a true friend like you. I'll join you!zts1328e	Well great! It's an honour to have you by my side!zts1329e	The Kovolt troops are approaching. An eerie silence lies over the battlefield.zts1330e	Knights' Captain: The battle is afoot. Get ready!zts1331e	Where did all those Kovolt soldiers come from?zts1332e	Knights' Captain: These soldiers are following Korrkoaren, the most powerful warrior of the Koaren tribes. They call him the Grey Storm. He's a completely different calibre to those weakling miners. Be on your guard!zts1333e	Knights' Captain: Even more enemies than we expected. This won't be easy!zts1334e	Knight: The NosVille guards will soon reinforce us.zts1335e	Knights' Captain: Excellent! We must stop Korrkoaren at all costs!zts1336e	Knights' Captain: Our reinforcements have arrived. Charge! This will be a glorious victory!zts1337e	Whoever stands in our way shall be cut down!zts1338e	Kovolt 1: Arrghhh!!!zts1339e	Kovolt 2: RETREAT! NOW!zts1340e	Kovolt 3: Retreat and regroup! Korrkoaren will be here soon, and then we can launch our counterattack!zts1341e	Knights' Captain: The Kovolts are retreating! Chase them down! Leave none alive!zts1342e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: This is as far as we can go.zts1343e	Knights' Captain: What? Are you scared? What's the matter with you?zts1344e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: The NosVille guards are responsible for protecting the village. We cannot go any further from NosVille!zts1345e	Knights' Captain: Nonsense! You're just too afraid! But we can do without the likes of cowards like you. Be gone with you!zts1346e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: You shouldn't insult our honour like that!zts1347e	Knights' Captain: Hah! What honour? Go home if you cherish your life so much!zts1348e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: *quietly* We just don't see the point of this fight!zts1349e	Knights' Captain: What did you say?zts1350e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Me? Oh, nothing... Right then, we're off.zts1351e	Kovolt 1: Here comes the Grey Storm!zts1352e	Kovolt 2: Korrkoaren is here!zts1353e	Kovolt 3: Finally, our great warrior!zts1355e	Is that Korrkoaren?zts1356e	Knight 1: The Kovolts are coming en masse!zts1357e	Knight 2: There's too many of them! We can't stop them!zts1358e	Knights' Captain: Let's fall back and then regroup!zts1359e	Knight 3: Oh no! They've blocked our path! There's no way out!zts1360e	Knights' Captain: Damn it! Then let's take the eastern valley. Hurry!zts1361e	Knights' Captain: No sign of the Kovolts!zts1362e	Knight 1: We made it! We managed to get away.zts1363e	Knights' Captain: That was a close call! Now we can reform the troops and prepare for a counterattack. Everyone...zts1364e	Listen here, pesky humans!zts1365e	Knights' Captain: Aaah! Who's that?zts1366e	Humans, you're surrounded! Surrender now or you will die!zts1367e	Knights' Captain: No! We've fallen into their trap!zts1368e	Knights' Captain: How did this happen? I can't believe it!zts1369e	*yawn* What's happened? I suddenly feel so tired...zts1370e	Wake up!zts1371e	Wha... where... where am I?zts1372e	You're being held in the Kovolts' underground prison.zts1373e	Who's there?zts1374e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: It's us. The NosVille guards! We didn't join the battle, but we thought it would be a good idea to keep an eye on you. Looks like we were right!zts1375e	I'm sorry!zts1376e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Never mind for now, we can talk about that later. Right now we need to concentrate on getting out of here.zts1377e	How are we going to manage that?zts1378e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: We used to patrol this area regularly. I know all the ins and outs of these passageways, including a few secret ones. Come on, follow me!zts1379e	They're getting away!zts1380e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Oh no, we've been spotted!zts1381e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: It's time to make a choice.zts1382e	What about?zts1383e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: If we use these crystals, we'll be able to get out of here faster.zts1384e	So what are we waiting for?zts1385e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: The problem is that the Kovolts might hear use if we use them. They'll be able to track us down...zts1386e	Oh, I see...zts1387e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: If we take a left, it's a bit of a detour but we'll be on safer ground. What do you think? Which path should we take?zts1388e	How am I supposed to decide?zts1389e	There's the exit!zts1390e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: There don't appear to be many guards around here. Let's deal with them and get out of here!zts1391e	Yeah!!zts1392e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: We made it!zts1393e	(Relieved.) And we're still alive!zts1394e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: A lot of Kovolts had to die for that.zts1395e	Yes, but the humans made a big sacrifice as well.zts1396e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: I fear that our hopes of peace are growing fainter!zts1397e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: What is done, is done. But that's no reason to give up hope. We need to remain optimistic for the future. Right, let's get out of here!zts1398e	This is the Kenkos' main camp. The Kenkos are very hostile to humans, so keep your head down. Korrkoaren is also around here somewhere. Make sure the two of them don't meet.zts1399e	Korrkoaren's coming!zts1400e	??zts1401e	Kill him!zts1402e	Why?zts1403e	He's trying to defy the demons' will.zts1404e	But I don't have any reason to kill him. I refuse!zts1405e	Do you think Korrkoaren will accept you, even though you refused to do battle against Lord Cuarry?zts1406e	Maybe... but I still can't do it!zts1407e	We promised your tribe new lands.zts1408e	If you hadn't come to Kreano, we'd never have needed any new land.zts1409e	Kreano is a holy place for the demons. Anyone who settles there commits a grave sin. If the father of the demons weren't so merciful, none of you would be left alive!zts1410e	Grrr! I will never turn my sword against my own tribe!zts1411e	(This is getting serious! We should get out of here!)zts1412e	Please keep away from this Kenko!zts1413e	Don't you understand? He's signed a pact with the devil! Would you trust a guy who's sold his soul to evil?!zts1414e	I am sure there must be some logical explanation...zts1415e	No way! What if this Kenko has betrayed us...zts1416e	Hey! Watch what you're saying.zts1417e	Master!zts1418e	I will meet this Kenko. I must trust our brother!zts1419e	Kenko Flailman!zts1420e	Grrr... Long time, no see!zts1421e	Why? Why did you choose to help these demons?zts1422e	Tell me!zts1423e	Brother, if you expect me to apologise, you're going to be disappointed!zts1424e	Master! You needn't waste any more of your time.zts1425e	It is not too late. Let's work together, my brother!zts1426e	Be gone with you! Just get out of my sight. Otherwise...zts1427e	But brother...!zts1428e	Please, just go!zts1429e	The ground suddenly begins to shake. It's a demon!zts1430e	You don't have to do this.zts1431e	Fire at will!zts1432e	Korrkoaren! Kenel! Be careful!zts1433e	Is that your answer?zts1434e	Yes! In the hallowed name of our ancestors, I will never forgive you!zts1435e	Come on, go get them!zts1436e	Master! Over here! This way!zts1437e	Hurry!zts1438e	Phew, we were lucky there!zts1439e	It's so sad!zts1440e	Let's get out of here first!zts1441e	I'm so disappointed in myself. I never would have thought I could raise my sword against my own flesh and blood!zts1442e	There's no time to lose!zts1443e	You're right. We need to leave!zts1444e	It's so sad! Kenko Flailman! I will never forgive my brother!zts1445e	I've been waiting for you.zts1446e	I'm sorry... Kenel was...zts1447e	I know. But if we plan to rescue Kenel, we need to be quick. Give me the report.zts1448e	Here it is.zts1449e	Fernon Report: Fernon was created by the will of the divine mother Erenia. This giant tree forms a link between hell and the heavens.zts1450e	Damn it! The Kenkos are trying to break the seal around Fernon!zts1451e	And what happens if the seal is broken?zts1452e	Turn to the next page of the report!zts1453e	Report: The disciples of Goddess Zenas sealed the Fernon tree. As a consequence, the gateway to the world was closed, and the realm created by the divine mother Erenia became one great prison. Since that time, Fernon has been slowly withering in the area between Mount Krem and NosVille...zts1454e	Is that all it says?zts1455e	Don't be dense! Keep reading!zts1456e	Fernon Report: When the seal is broken, Fernon will be revived. Its immense power would destroy everything around Mount Krem and NosVille, while the Fernon tree itself would live on forever, feeding on the creatures of the earth...zts1457e	You mean, everyone would die?zts1458e	Yes... but I think I'm starting to understand what's really going on. The demons are aiming to...zts1459e	The demons are aiming to what?zts1460e	The demons are originally beings from another world. They cannot normally survive in this world. But the demons coming from the north don't seen to have any problem... In fact, they've already become a serious threat to us! But if Fernon's seal is completely removed...zts1461e	Then it would leave the demon forces completely free to flood into our world!zts1462e	Yes, I'm afraid you're right. We don't have any time to lose! Let's get moving. If Fernon's seal is broken, the game is up!zts1463e	If we follow this path, we can reach Fernon's roots. We must stop the ceremony before the Kenkos finish it!zts1464e	Knights' Captain: You cannot pass here!zts1465e	We don't have time for this. Let us through!zts1466e	Knights' Captain: The humans are standing by the Kovolts. I cannot forgive you.zts1467e	If we arrive too late, we may all die!zts1468e	Knights' Captain: Huh? What on earth are you talking about?zts1469e	Just calm down and take a good look at this.zts1470e	He'll be astonished when he reads the report...zts1471e	Now do you understand what I mean?zts1472e	Knights' Captain: Hmm....zts1473e	Lord Cuarry might only be interested in the rights to the mines in Kreano. But the demons had their eyes on something different right from the beginning. They're planning to kill all of us!zts1474e	Knights' Captain: Impossible! That can't be!zts1475e	Right from the start it was a massive mistake to work together with the demons.zts1476e	Grrr... humans are such greedy creatures! The Kovolts would never even dream of something like that!zts1477e	Knights' Captain: It's a disgrace!zts1478e	Thanks to your stupidity, many of my brothers had to lay down their lives.zts1479e	Knights' Captain: I'm not going to take advice from a Kovolt!zts1480e	Hahaha! No wonder why you're human.zts1481e	Where are we?zts1482e	This is the start of a complex maze system. Make sure you don't get lost. We can't afford to lose any time here.zts1483e	Arghhhh! *groans*zts1484e	What was that? That sound is very close.zts1485e	It's Kenel! He must be close.zts1486e	Who's there?!zts1487e	Kenel! You're alive!zts1488e	Oh it's you... Argh!zts1489e	Are you badly injured?zts1490e	How did you get here?zts1491e	I managed to slip away! But afterwards I got lost in this maze and was injured.zts1492e	You can count yourself lucky!zts1493e	I snatched the key from one of the guards. If we can find an exit, we'll be able to get out of here.zts1494e	Well that's good! But we have to find the Kenkos first!zts1495e	Oh! Looks like this is the end of the maze!zts1496e	Grrr!zts1497e	Ahh!zts1498e	Urgh!zts1499e	Oh... I don't feel too good. We need to hurry!zts1500e	Now all the seals are broken.zts1501e	We're too late!zts1502e	Hmm... who are you?zts1503e	We don't have time to waste on them. Let's go!zts1504e	They've disappeared!zts1505e	This place is falling apart! Hurry! We need to get out of here, and fast!zts1506e	Oh no! We're all going to die!zts1507e	Pull yourself together! We'll find a way out!zts1508e	The Fernon tree is waking, but it's not too late. If we can interrupt the energy stream before it fully revives, we can still stop the tree from awakening.zts1509e	Is that true?zts1510e	Let me help you! We must try everything we can to stop it!zts1511e	This route might be slightly longer, but if you follow it you can reach Fernon's heart without being caught by the imps.zts1512e	Do you really think I can make it?zts1513e	Of course! Have faith in yourself and your comrades!zts1514e	I'm still not convinced...zts1515e	Stop right there! Enemies of Fernon!zts1516e	Aaaah... they're too strong!zts1517e	Bah, but I can't give up so easily! Ah, someone's coming! Who's that? Are they imps?!zts1518e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: What are you doing here?!zts1519e	Hey!zts1520e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Keep going! I've got everything under control here.zts1521e	You do?zts1522e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Don't talk so much! How dare you come here without me? We'll have to have a word about that... but not now!zts1523e	It's getting more difficult to withstand them...zts1524e	Not yet...zts1525e	Knights' Captain: Do you want to surrender so quickly?zts1526e	Captain!zts1527e	Knights' Captain: Don't worry about, just keep going! All this is Lord Cuarry and my fault. I will take responsibility for this mess. I'm sorry!zts1528e	This must be the end...zts1529e	*cough* Hey! What are you doing here?zts1530e	Kenel! Your body...zts1531e	No time for that! Don't worry about me. You have to deal with Fernon!zts1532e	I'm so tired...zts1533e	Are you giving up?zts1534e	Bob!!!zts1535e	I had a hard time catching up with you! Leave all this to me!zts1536e	Thanks Bob!zts1537e	It was a great pleasure travelling with you. Now be quick! For our friendship!zts1538e	Damn!zts1539e	Adventurer! It's too soon to surrender!zts1540e	Tom?!zts1541e	Run for it! I've got your back!zts1542e	Thank you, Tom!zts1543e	Don't talk, just get out of here!zts1544e	Are we there?zts1545e	We made it! We've reached Fernon's heart... Let's go!zts1546e	But our attacks are completely useless!zts1547e	It seems to be completely beyond our power...zts1548e	Not yet!zts1549e	Enemies of Fernon! You will pay for this!zts1550e	You are the enemies of this world! The enemies of my brother! You will not get away with this!zts1551e	Korrkoaren's sword penetrates Fernon's heart! Suddenly, everything around you turns white... you gradually lose consciousness...zts1552e	Where am I?zts1553e	Ah, you're awake! Do you realise? We did it!zts1554e	Ah... that was such a long day.zts1555e	I'm fed up of Lord Cuarry... and the rest of them! Haha!zts1556e	I never expected I'd be fighting alongside humans... Grrr...zts1557e	Is it all over now?zts1558e	I think so. I think time we enjoyed a well earned rest...zts1559e	By the way... where's Korrkoaren?zts1560e	Are you looking for me?zts1561e	You're alive! Wonderful!zts1562e	Yes, but only thanks to you my brave friend! I'm very grateful for all your help!zts1563e	Haha! You're most welcome. I only did what had to be done.zts1564e	Nevertheless... many of our brothers had to lay down their lives for this fight.zts1565e	(Everyone looks down in silence, each person remembering the faces of those who fell for the cause. Suddenly, the air is filled with a foul stench. The smell of demons...)zts1566e	The demons! And Kenko!zts1567e	You!zts1568e	I think I'm lost. Warriors!zts1569e	But it's not over yet. I will never forget what happened today!zts1570e	The demons and Kenkos have disappeared.zts1571e	He's right. This isn't over yet.zts1572e	The Fernon tree is dead! The demon forces can no longer pass into our world!zts1573e	Fernon is far from dead. She is immortal, just like Erenia. But she has returned to her deep sleep.zts1574e	What should we do now then?zts1575e	If we can't kill him, we'll have to find a way to ensure that he remains asleep for all eternity. Someone has to seal the tree.zts1576e	Seal it?zts1577e	Would the Catsies be capable of such a thing?zts1578e	Catsies?!zts1579e	Korrkoaren and Kenel's faces turn rigid all of a sudden. What happened? Dark clouds have gathered over the Fernon Outpost and a palpable sense of danger hangs in the air. The feeling causes all of the adventurers to fall silent.zts1580e	Act 2zts1581e	(The smell of evil is everywhere here. Mount Krem is also polluted with it.)zts1582e	What brings you here?zts1583e	Kenel! Good to see you!zts1584e	While I was focusing on the war in NosVille, Mount Krem was overrun with demons.zts1585e	Look out!zts1586e	*sigh* The demons here are tougher than in NosVille.zts1587e	Has anything special happened in the town?zts1588e	It is very quiet. Come and visit us. I have several things to tell you... My master also wants to know how you are doing.zts1589e	Haha... Yes, of course... I'll stop by...zts1590e	I'll investigate this place for a while.zts1591e	Then I'll accompany you!zts1592e	Hmm?zts1593e	What is it?zts1594e	No, it's nothing. This stench was just making me feel really ill.zts1595e	These monsters stink rotten. It disgusts me.zts1596e	I'm not talking about the smell of the monsters. It's something different.zts1597e	The stench is so penetrating that I feel really sick... and I'm getting a headache.zts1598e	It smells like Catsies!!zts1599e	Hohohoho...zts1600e	Stop right there! You hideous creature!zts1601e	You ungrateful wretches! I'm out of here!zts1602e	Where's she gone? Hm?zts1603e	It's useless. She's disappeared. But look, we've got company.zts1604e	Kenel! I have to ask you something. What are these Catsies?zts1605e	A truly disgusting people!zts1606e	Pardon? Disgusting?zts1607e	They smell odd, and they have ridiculous names and weird-looking clothes.zts1608e	Hm... I don't know what you mean... what's revolting about that?zts1609e	Let's not talk about it any more.zts1610e	But why would you say something like that? That's really mean.zts1611e	Don't pay attention to this stupid story!zts1612e	But... something isn't quite right, don't you think?zts1613e	I don't want to talk about it any more. Whatever, let's get out of here. There's no point in searching any more.zts1614e	(Fernon's remains can be seen clearly from here. But while her life force may have been extinguished and she is wilting, she still looks dangerous.)zts1615e	Is it because of Fernon? Nowadays, the demons are more aggressive and violent. Fernon is sleeping, right?zts1616e	Fernon isn't sleeping.zts1617e	Who... who's there?zts1618e	Haha! You'd better watch out for monsters.zts1619e	Who on earth is it?zts1620e	Hmm, you're better than I thought. Haha...zts1621e	Where the devil are you? Come out and speak!zts1622e	Maybe I'm her... or over here...zts1623e	If you really what to know, you'll have to find me without help.zts1624e	What?! Is that some kind of joke?!zts1625e	Yep... Well done!zts1626e	This! Did you do this?zts1627e	No.zts1628e	Are you mocking me?zts1629e	Hehe, I really don't have time to mock you right now.zts1630e	Do you see the lever in the centre of the room?zts1631e	Hmm, yes?zts1632e	Pull it!zts1633e	Hey, who are you anyway? Why are you making fun of me?zts1634e	Hmm... I've never made fun of you.zts1635e	Stop this nonsense and show yourself!zts1636e	Perhaps in the next room...zts1637e	Huh?zts1638e	Hahaha! I promise you'll find me there. Come on, why don't we have a chat over a cup of coffee?zts1639e	Where are you?! Show yourself NOW!!!zts1640e	Ta-dah!zts1641e	Eek!zts1642e	Nice to make your acquaintance. My name is Catlotte de Whitewine! I'm a noble princess of the Forest family!zts1643e	What... what... what kind of creature are you?zts1644e	You fool! Have you never seen a Catsy before?zts1645e	Hahaha, yeah, Catsy! Are you hearing his name for the first time today?zts1646e	No, no!zts1647e	Well, nice to meet you, anyways! What would you like to drink? Coffee, red tea, hot chocolate, fresh fruit juice... hmm... there's also mineral water if you don't want any of those.zts1648e	I... I don't want anything right now! Just answer my question!zts1649e	How embarrassing! You're talking to me as if I've committed some kind of crime.zts1650e	Shut up! Why are you following me around?zts1651e	I've never done anything.zts1652e	And what's the meaning of everything that's gone on here so far?zts1653e	It's nothing to do with me!zts1654e	Are you mocking me?zts1655e	What would I do that? Haha!zts1656e	(She's got an ulterior motive... I can see it in her face.)zts1657e	Don't look at me like that. You're making me blush!zts1658e	So, what are you doing here?zts1659e	Me? I'm a prisoner of Fernon.zts1660e	What?zts1661e	Prisoner of Fernon! Yep, that's me! You saved me like a knight in shining armour on a white horse! Thank you!zts1662e	If you're a prisoner, that means you have nothing to do with the monsters around here, right?zts1663e	Of course not! There were a few monsters that were guarding me, but... thanks to you, I'm free again now! Wahoo!zts1664e	(This person is really strange. Ah, it's all so complicated that it gives me a headache.)zts1665e	You...zts1666e	You're cute. I have to say.zts1667e	Oh! Don't come any closer!zts1668e	See you then! Hehe!zts1669e	Kenel! What's going on here?zts1670e	Here they are!!!zts1671e	They?zts1672e	Those disgusting Catsies!zts1673e	Argh!zts1674e	I don't know why they started bothering us. But if that's the way they want it, that's the way they'll have it. Let's start our search here.zts1675e	Soldier 1: Yes!zts1676e	Soldier 2: Aye-aye, Sir!zts1677e	You! You human!zts1678e	Oh, and who are you?zts1679e	My name is Cenil de Strawberrypie. I am the Captain of the Rosebud Whitewitches and the greatest Catsy white witch. I just want to ask you for directions, so please help me!zts1680e	Ah, yes! Ask away.zts1681e	Do you know where the dirty Kovolts live?zts1682e	I beg your pardon?zts1683e	I don't know why you look so surprised. If my question was rude, I sincerely apologise.zts1684e	No, it's not that. But before I answer, I'd like to ask you a question.zts1685e	As you wish.zts1686e	Tell me, Catsy, what do you think of the Kovolts?zts1687e	Those foolish, wild, filthy creatures... I don't want to say another word about them.zts1688e	In that case, why do you want to find them?zts1689e	They must be punished for their wickedness!zts1690e	The Kovolts around here are my friends. For that reason, I'm not going to answer your question!zts1691e	Oh!!! You are a friend of the Kovolts?zts1692e	I don't know you! But if you're going to try and fight against my friends, you'd better get out of here!zts1693e	Whoa!!! If you're really a friend of the Kovolts...zts1694e	(Cenil grins.)zts1695e	... then you're our enemy!zts1696e	Rosebud Whitewitches! Punish him!!!zts1697e	Rosebud Whitewitches: In the name of the Rosebuds!!!zts1698e	Arghhh!zts1699e	Don't kill him! Keep him alive until we find out where this filthy Kovolt village is!zts1700e	Rosebud Whitewitches: Yessir!zts1701e	Could it be?zts1702e	*booom!* (A blast like an explosion breaks out. Dense dust is whirled up and spreads throughout the room.)zts1703e	Hey... wake up!!!zts1704e	Ah! Kenel!zts1705e	Follow me, before they see you!zts1706e	Haha... They won't let you live once they find out you're on the Kovolts' side.zts1707e	Really?zts1708e	That's so sad. The Koaren tribe are suffering enough under the threat of Fernon. And now here comes another war.zts1709e	W... war? Does it really have to come to that?zts1710e	Yes. Simply because we are Kovolts and they are Catsies!zts1711e	... Has there ever been a major conflict between your peoples?zts1712e	... It's never got that far.zts1713e	Then why can't you be friends? Just like you and I have become friends!zts1714e	Impossible...zts1715e	Why is that impossible? You've never even tried...zts1716e	Their appearance alone! Repulsive! Disgusting! Snobby!zts1717e	Do you think that's a good reason?zts1718e	And then there's their names. For their surnames they use...zts1719e	What?zts1720e	They use the names of their favourite foods!zts1721e	Grrr... Just very... creepy creatures!zts1722e	Have... have you had such problems... I mean... Have you ever... had this problem?zts1723e	You humans just can't understand it. Just like you hate flies and beetles, we hate Catsies. We're complete opposites! Whenever we see each other, all we want to do is destroy each other...zts1724e	You risk your life to destroy them?zts1725e	It is those disgusting creatures that started this war!!!zts1726e	(He'll never understand it!)zts1727e	Humans... I wanted to ask you for a help, but I guess I can't.zts1728e	Go back! I don't want to drag you into this conflict!zts1729e	Grrr! They... they are very strong! Retreat! Retreat!zts1730e	Knights of the Rosebud! Show them our anger and power!zts1731e	Kenel! Are you all right?zts1732e	Ah! It's you!zts1733e	Hmm... you're not bad warriors. But stop now. There shouldn't be any more casualties for the time being - on either side. I want to ask you something.zts1734e	You don't have to answer! This is between the two of us!!! One of us won't be here soon!zts1735e	Do the filthy Kovolts have any idea what honour is?zts1736e	Stinky Catsies! How dare you mention honour with your filthy mouths?!zts1737e	Stop it! The pair of you! What do you want to know, Cenil?zts1738e	You buffoons! Why did you wake up Fernon?zts1739e	Answer me!zts1740e	How do you know that Fernon has woken up?zts1741e	Shame on you! You have no idea of the damage you have done...zts1742e	I asked you how you know!zts1743e	Oh, you sinner! We Catsies are creatures of intuition. I know everything.zts1744e	We didn't wake Fernon!zts1745e	Ha! Fernon can't be woken without the blood of the Kovolts! Stop your lying!zts1746e	Now it all makes sense. You have awoken Fernon and now you want to seal her again... That's why you kidnapped our princess! What have you done with Catlotte?!zts1747e	Princess?zts1748e	I know that you have spared our princess. I can still sense her heartbeat. But if you...zts1749e	Hehe!!!zts1750e	If you so much as harm a hair on her head, I'll send you straight to hell!zts1751e	Hahahahaha!!! Mwhahahahahahaha!zts1752e	Are you laughing at me?zts1753e	You stinky Catsy! Listen! I won't be intimidated by your empty threats! By the way, it's fantastic to have the life of the Catsy princess in my hands! Hahahahaha!!!zts1754e	Kenel! What are you talking about?!zts1755e	Retreat! We're pulling back!zts1756e	Remember! Just a single scratch is enough to start a war. And then you will regret your arrogance!zts1757e	Kenel!zts1758e	(There is no reason to fight any more! Let's start searching for the Catsy princess!)zts1759e	Brothers! The princess of the Catsies is hiding somewhere nearby! Find her before the day is over! Bring her to me alive! Hurry!zts1760e	Ah, Kenel!zts1761e	Oh! What brings you here?zts1762e	Oh, I was just in the area...zts1763e	You're not looking for the Catsy princess like us, are you?zts1764e	Erm... no, no!zts1765e	Hmm. Something smells fishy, but that's by the by. You're a human, so we can't show you how to follow the laws of the Kovolts!zts1766e	Haha! Well, doesn't matter. I don't have much time. See you later!zts1767e	Excuse me...zts1768e	Brothers! Catsies are very agile. Be extremely vigilant in your search for the princess! We need to find the Catsy princess at all costs! Hurry!zts1769e	Oh, you... it's you!zts1770e	Hey, my brave knight! Help me out of here!zts1771e	What do you mean?zts1772e	I'll just go and hide. You'll think of something when they ask after me!zts1773e	Argh!zts1774e	What are you doing here?!zts1775e	You haven't happened to see a young Catsy running around here, have you?zts1776e	Erm... I mean...zts1777e	Bah! I shouldn't have asked...zts1778e	Ah! We meet again!zts1779e	Good to see you! I need to tell you something!zts1780e	Sorry, I don't have time for this. Bye!zts1781e	It's dangerous here! You need to leave this place immediately!zts1782e	I know! Bye!zts1783e	Oh... you're still here?zts1784e	Yes...zts1785e	Are you planning to save the Catsy princess?zts1786e	Oh, no... No... I don't think...zts1787e	I don't mean to pressure you... But I am a bit disappointed.zts1788e	Stop right there!!!zts1789e	Oh! My knight!zts1790e	I told you this place is dangerous!zts1791e	Ah, now you're worrying about me?zts1792e	No, no, no, NO!!!zts1793e	Thanks for your concern! But I've got something to do here... Take care!zts1794e	(A battle between Catlotte and Kenel! If I don't do something, the consequences will be disastrous!)zts1795e	Stop it!zts1796e	Oh... my knight!zts1797e	Mind your own business!zts1798e	Stop it! Kenel! She's still just a little girl!zts1799e	Why are you standing in my way?zts1800e	There's no reason to fight. She came here to seal Fernon!zts1801e	I know! But still!zts1802e	So, you know about it. Well, if you know, you should stop fighting!zts1803e	But Catsies and Kovolts cannot live side by side! It is our destiny!zts1804e	Please! Stop it!zts1805e	Stop this arguing. I give up.zts1806e	What's that supposed to mean?!zts1807e	I'll go with this Kovolt. I give up. I can't do this any longer.zts1808e	A-a-are you insane?!zts1809e	By the way, my knight!zts1810e	I saved you!zts1811e	Haha... you probably don't remember what happened back in Fernon's heart!zts1812e	Oh... that was you?zts1813e	Thank you! I was taken prisoner by Fernon some time ago. I think it's time to pay you back!zts1814e	She talks too much... Be quiet! Brothers! Arrest that smelly Catsy!zts1815e	(It's silent. The flames of torches blaze brightly. Koaren guards are patrolling the corridors. I must avoid any conflict with them, otherwise the peace treaty between humans and Kovolts will be broken... I'll sneak inside and rescue Princess Catlotte!)zts1816e	Soldier 1: I heard those dirty Catsies have started strolling around here lately. Is that true?zts1817e	Soldier 2: *grrrrr* It'll end in war!zts1818e	Soldier 1: War???zts1819e	Soldier 2: Captain Kenel recently had a big encounter with the Catsy knights. If their knights are coming to Mount Krem, it is clear what they have in mind!zts1820e	Soldier 1: *grrr* I see, so that's why!zts1821e	Soldier 2: Why what? What do you mean?zts1822e	Soldier 1: A Catsy has been taken prisoner. She's being held somewhere around here...zts1823e	Soldier 2: Damn it! That does not sound good... I hate the sight of Catsies!zts1824e	Soldier 1: Anyway, it's not good... It's not all that long since the war in NosVille ended...zts1825e	Soldier 1: Do you know the Catsy girl that's being held prisoner here?zts1826e	Soldier 2: *grrrr* She smells disgusting!zts1827e	Soldier 1: Those horrible creatures call it 'perfume'! Nasty!zts1828e	Soldier 2: Oh... it gives me the creeps! I don't know why they're keeping her alive. Let's just kill her and bury here somewhere, I say!zts1829e	Soldier 1: I have worked for this prison for a long time. But I have never felt this bad.zts1830e	Now the Knights of the Rosebud are desperately searching for their princess. If they find out she's here, they will attack us immediately!zts1831e	Hmmm...zts1832e	We'll disarm them and bring them here! And then we will execute all of them for defiling our Mount Krem.zts1833e	There's no need to kill the princess. And we won't fight against the Catsy knights.zts1834e	Can't you see? The Catsies are the only ones who can seal Fernon again! So why should we make them our enemies?!zts1835e	No!!!zts1836e	If Fernon wakes up, we are all doomed! Then we will lose many of our brothers. And even if our people survive, we'll still have lost our homeland.zts1837e	Grrrr...zts1838e	I can't let my brothers die just because of some old grudge!zts1839e	I'll never join forces with the Catsies, even if it means losing our brothers!zts1840e	Shut up! I'll put an end to this old feud between the Koaren and Catsies. And then we'll send Fernon into an eternal sleep.zts1841e	Then don't leave her here!zts1842e	You there! How did you get in here?!zts1843e	I imagine it must have been a doddle with his skills!zts1844e	I have no idea why the princess followed you, but there is no need to keep her here, is there? Please, let her go!zts1845e	No, I can't.zts1846e	What if she falls into the Kenkos' hands?zts1847e	Oh! You seem to understand.zts1848e	But the Rosebud Whitewitches won't let it happen.zts1849e	I wanted to see you for this reason... Now that you're here, everything will be easier.zts1850e	Pass my letter to the Rosebud Whitewitches.zts1851e	Oh, what kind of letter is it?zts1852e	A peace treaty.zts1853e	Do not question my decision, warrior! Go now and meet the Catsies.zts1854e	It's not possible.zts1855e	Since you sneaked here so well, be quiet on the way out, too. Nobody knows you were here, except the three of us. And it's going to stay that way!zts1856e	Yes! Understood! I'll persuade the Catsies to sign the treaty.zts1857e	Argh! Kenel!zts1858e	... I'm sorry...zts1859e	I cannot let you go.zts1860e	Please. Reject my master's command.zts1861e	I'm sorry, but I can't!zts1862e	*grrr* Then... sorry for this.zts1863e	Brothers! Arrest him! And take that letter off him!zts1864e	My goodness!zts1865e	Hello!zts1866e	Wow! You gave me quite a fright.zts1867e	You're so cute! Hahaha!zts1868e	I'd really like to get you out of here, but I can't. They're all chasing me.zts1869e	Haha... This place isn't bad, though!zts1870e	Don't worry, the Koarens and Catsies want to patch things up.zts1871e	Haha... I know... My beauty and my loveliness can cause anyone's heart to melt! If Kovolts aren't blind, they won't be any different.zts1872e	(What an extraordinarily confident girl she is!)zts1873e	Hey! Are you just going to abandon me here?!zts1874e	Erm... I've got to go and meet the Rosebud Whitewitches. I'm going to get them to sign this peace treaty. Please have just a bit more patience!zts1875e	What? Cenil was here?zts1876e	Didn't you know about that?zts1877e	Cenil is... irritating, picky and boring to boot!zts1878e	Ah, I feel so wretched. My knight, please just leave me alone.zts1879e	(I'm slowly beginning to lose my patience with her!)zts1880e	I really just want to be alone right now.zts1881e	Kovolt 1: Halt!zts1882e	Kovolt 2: There's no escape!zts1883e	Kovolt 3: In the name of Kenel! Seize him, brothers!!!zts1884e	Kovolt 1: You won't give up!zts1885e	Kovolt 2: It's over now!zts1886e	Kovolt 3: There's no escaping from here!zts1887e	Stop it!zts1888e	Kovolt 1: Huh?!zts1889e	Kovolt 2: Master!zts1890e	Stop bothering him!zts1891e	Korr-Korrkoaren!!zts1892e	Warrior! Leave here now, quickly! I hope you will return soon with good news.zts1893e	Korrkoaren! Thank you! And don't worry: I will persuade Cenil, whatever it takes!zts1894e	Stop right there!zts1895e	You just won't give up, will you?zts1896e	Please. Give me the letter.zts1897e	No, not a chance!zts1898e	I don't want to fight you... But...zts1899e	Kovolts and Catsies can never be friends.zts1900e	Who are you?!zts1901e	Ah... you're a Catsy!zts1902e	I'm looking for Cenil. I need to speak to her urgently.zts1903e	Hm?zts1904e	Aren't you one of Cenil's comrades?zts1905e	Hmm... Why are you in such a hurry to see her?zts1906e	I have a letter from Korrkoaren! He wants to make peace.zts1907e	Do you mean the Korrkoaren? The master of the Koaren?zts1908e	Yes, that's the one!zts1909e	Give me the letter!zts1910e	Who are you anyway?zts1911e	The name's Catrisha de BlackCappuccino. I'm the younger sister of Princess Catlotte. You can call me Patty.zts1912e	Aha! The princess is being held prisoner by the Kovolts. But don't worry: she's fine. Read this first.zts1913e	(You hand Catrisha Korrkoaren's letter.)zts1914e	So, according to this letter...zts1915e	Without this letter, the peace treaty cannot be sealed.zts1916e	(Catrisha tears Korrkoaren's letter to pieces.)zts1917e	Wha... what are you doing?!zts1918e	As you said...zts1919e	Your sister's life is in danger!zts1920e	And? What have I got to do with that?zts1921e	Hohohohoho!!!zts1922e	Wh-wh-wh-who? Who on earth are you?zts1923e	I am Princess Catrisha, sister of Princess Catlotte. Ohh! Someone's coming. Hoho! I'll be off then. Goodbye!zts1924e	Stop right there!zts1925e	It's over. I've handed over the letter and it's already been torn up.zts1926e	What does that mean?zts1927e	I don't know. There was this strange Catsy girl and...zts1928e	Hmmm... was she a Darksy?zts1929e	Huh? What?zts1930e	You don't seem to know the difference. There are two factions of Catsies. One is liberal and peace-loving, and the other one, also known as Darksies, is radical and violent. Of course, the Darksies are much more dangerous.zts1931e	That's great news! The Darksies are on my side... hahaha!zts1932e	I couldn't agree more!zts1933e	Who are you?! And where are you?!zts1934e	Hehe... You're wondering who I am? Even though you don't know who is on your side and who isn't?zts1935e	You!zts1936e	I am Princess of the Catsies and the master of Darksies, Princess Catrisha de...zts1937e	Grrr...zts1938e	Kovolt scum.zts1939e	I'm going to kill you!!!zts1940e	You stinky Catsy!zts1941e	Hehe...zts1942e	(No, I can't get involved in this battle... I need to get out of here as quickly as possible and find Cenil!)zts1943e	Surely Cenil is around here... I have to find her and persuade her. If we succeed in making the peace treaty between the Kovolts and Catsies, there's nothing even Kenel and the Darksies can do.zts1944e	Cenil! Listen to me!zts1945e	Hmm... Don't you consider your life precious? Why have you come here by yourself?zts1946e	Stop it! Korrkoaren, master of the Koaren, wants to make peace.zts1947e	Ohohohohohoho!!!zts1948e	It's true. Believe me!zts1949e	If you were me, would you believe that?zts1950e	The hatred between our peoples runs much deeper than you can imagine. You won't just put an end to it with a few diplomatic words.zts1951e	Why do you bear such a grudge if even you cannot understand it?zts1952e	The origin of something can easily be forgotten over time. But even if nobody remembers, it doesn't mean that this origin never existed. Ever since we came to this world, we Catsies have hated the Kovolts. Even if we don't know why, this hatred still flows through our veins to this day. If you say we should put an end it this, that means...zts1953e	... it means that you are my enemy!zts1954e	This will come to an end!zts1955e	Wait!!! Cenil!zts1956e	Argh! Are you Patty?zts1957e	I never allowed you to use that name.zts1958e	I will never address a traitor like you with the title 'Princess'!zts1959e	How can you call me a traitor when you are the one standing against the will of the divine mother Erenia?!zts1960e	All the life and feelings of the Catsies originate from Princess Catlotte. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a traitor.zts1961e	You still haven't given up on Catlotte. She's insane.zts1962e	Just tell me your message and get out of here, otherwise I might go to the bother of running my sword through your heart.zts1963e	You're getting cocky! Just leave it be. I'll tell you my message.zts1964e	Untie him!zts1965e	I have a request.zts1966e	Why?zts1967e	Haha!!!zts1968e	Why should I follow your orders?zts1969e	If you don't Catlotte might die.zts1970e	!!!zts1971e	You don't seem to understand... You fought Korrkoaren not long ago.zts1972e	How dare you... What did you do to the Princess?!zts1973e	(Catrisha laughs scornfully.) If you do as I say, nothing will happen to anyone. You, human! Come with me!zts1974e	Why am I being rescued?zts1975e	Calm down and be reasonable!zts1976e	I won't forgive you, Patty. I will kill you.zts1977e	You'll be safe here.zts1978e	Wh... why did you save me?zts1979e	Because I'm the one who wants to make peace with the Kovolts!zts1980e	What?!zts1981e	Cenil hates the Kovolts. Her heart is full of hatred. If you had met her and shown her Korrkoaren's letter, you wouldn't be alive now.zts1982e	Really!zts1983e	You're living on the edge.zts1984e	And why did you anger Kenel? Why did you fight against him?zts1985e	Kenel has the same cunning smell as Cenil.zts1986e	I don't care if it's Cenil or Kenel. I would agree the peace treaty with the Kovolts... and help them deal with Fernon!zts1987e	Will you do it for yourself?zts1988e	(Catrisha laughs scornfully.) Never underestimate the Darksies!zts1989e	What was that all of a sudden?!zts1990e	Ahh! Not bad!zts1991e	Why did you attack?zts1992e	Sorry about that, I just wanted to see what you've got. Anyway, I want to introduce myself and my squad. We are the Blackshoe Knights, the Darksies' elite unit.zts1993e	Blackshoe Knights!zts1994e	I'll head off with them now and meet Korrkoaren.zts1995e	But why didn't you go to meet Korrkoaren directly?zts1996e	Because most Kovolts hate the Catsies. But I don't have to worry anymore, now I have Blackshoe Knights as allies!zts1997e	Kovolt: Kaaaaa!zts1998e	Oh, what is going on?zts1999e	Kovolt: Kenko is here...zts2000e	Kovolt: Korrkoaren is in danger! Please... help him!zts2001e	(Kenel's men and Cenil's Rosebud Whitewitches are fighting each other!)zts2002e	Stop it! Stop it right now!zts2003e	Why are you stopping me?zts2004e	What on earth is wrong with you?!zts2005e	Now's not the right time for this! Korrkoaren has been attacked by Kenko - he's in great danger!zts2006e	Master?zts2007e	So what? What's that got to do with me?zts2008e	It matters to me!zts2009e	Catrisha! And the Blackshoe Knights!zts2010e	I'll handle this... go with Kenel and find Korrkoaren!zts2011e	I don't need help from a Catsy!zts2012e	Kenel! We don't have time for this!zts2013e	We don't have much time! Leave the fighting to me and look for the master!zts2014e	Will... will you come out of it in one piece?zts2015e	Hey, it'll be a piece of cake!zts2016e	What are you doing?!zts2017e	So, you're the Catsy who knows a thing or two about magic seals?zts2018e	Let me go! Let me go!!!zts2019e	Kenko! Stop it, that's enough!zts2020e	Oh, my knight! Do something!zts2021e	Oh, you're quick!zts2022e	It's over! Give up!zts2023e	(The demon snatches Catlotte and runs away with her.)zts2024e	Arghhh!!! Help me!!!zts2025e	No!!!zts2026e	Excellent! Hey, you human... I won't forget what you did to me today!zts2027e	Are you okay?zts2028e	Kovolt: Korr... Korrkoaren... please! Argh!zts2029e	Damn. He's dead.zts2030e	It's okay. It's not that serious.zts2031e	Oh, Catrisha!zts2032e	Hmmm...zts2033e	Wait. He's coming to.zts2034e	Oh, and... where is Cenil anyway?zts2035e	We sent her away. She was injured and will be out of action for a while. By the way... where is Catlotte?zts2036e	Did something happen?zts2037e	I'm sorry, she was kidnapped by Kenko.zts2038e	Oh my god! We have to find her at all costs!!!zts2039e	Yes... definitely.zts2040e	Oh, sister...zts2041e	By the way, Catrisha...zts2042e	Call me Patty.zts2043e	Ah... Patty. Why don't you and Cenil get on? You both like Catlotte, right?zts2044e	Is there any reason for that? Something you can't talk about?zts2045e	It's just like the difference between Catsy and Darksy... haha!zts2046e	What do you mean?zts2047e	Well, it's... we just can't talk to each other. If I say any more, it'll just lead to misunderstandings. Just forget it.zts2048e	... Okay.zts2049e	Are you chasing Kenko, too?zts2050e	Of course. I don't know why Kenko kidnapped Catlotte, but l do know it's not just for a friendly chat!zts2051e	Do you know the reason?zts2052e	Did you know that Catlotte has the power to seal Fernon?zts2053e	Yes, and?zts2054e	The reverse is also possible.zts2055e	Okay, let's work together this once. We need to rescue my sister at all costs!zts2056e	You, Catsy, who are you?zts2057e	My name is Catrisha de BlackCappuccino, Princess of the Darksies and leader of the Blackshoe Knights.zts2058e	Are you the one who rescued me?zts2059e	Of course.zts2060e	And why did you do that?zts2061e	To end the long history of enmity between our peoples.zts2062e	As a kind of peace offering.zts2063e	Hmmm...zts2064e	I will give you the life of Kenko.zts2065e	And what if I reject it?zts2066e	Do you think I would compromise with the Catsies to save me and my people?zts2067e	But if it's the only way to save you and your brothers?zts2068e	I hereby declare that the Kovolts and Catsies have made peace. And now I'm off. Bye.zts2069e	Wait!zts2070e	Kenko's troops are approaching now.zts2071e	Oh?zts2072e	I'll give you a gift too and make sure that they don't catch you!zts2073e	It's an honour. Haha...zts2074e	But I won't survive this alone. Would you stand by my side with your Blackshoe Knights?zts2075e	Of course.zts2076e	Here's the way down.zts2077e	*sigh* We've finally found it!zts2078e	Wow! Cenil!zts2079e	Haha... Is it you, Patty?zts2080e	Watch what you're saying. I remember when someone's mean to me.zts2081e	(Cenil laughs scornfully.) I don't have to show any respect to someone who has betrayed the princess.zts2082e	Stop... stop it!zts2083e	The most important thing right now is to find my sister. We need to put aside our differences for now!zts2084e	Do you want to... don't you want to join us?zts2085e	Hm... Okay, because the princess is in danger... However...zts2086e	Go on.zts2087e	Once we've brought the princess to safety, I won't be able to guarantee the safety of this human any more.zts2088e	Okay, as you wish.zts2089e	Wh... wh... what does that mean?!zts2090e	Hey... you filthy Kenkos... show us what you've got!zts2091e	Hm... we need to get through there.zts2092e	They are too many of them. We can't waste any more time here. Let's leave it to the Rosebud Whitewitches.zts2093e	Don't have to explain everything to us in detail. Just give the order!zts2094e	Brave Rosebud Whitewitches! Let's stay here and show those dirty Kovolts our ferocity. Spare no one!zts2095e	Whitewitches: In the name of the Rosebuds!zts2096e	I've found the way down!zts2097e	I can feel it. We'll find the princess soon!zts2098e	Smelly creatures! All together! Attack the Catsies!zts2099e	Kenel! Stop it!zts2100e	(Cenil laughs scornfully.) You didn't want it any other way. Now I'll take your life.zts2101e	No!!!zts2102e	Hey, little kid! Stay out of this.zts2103e	No... never... I can't allow you to kill Kenel!zts2104e	Let her through, human!!! If this is my end, so be it. But I will never bow down before a stinky Catsy and beg for my life.zts2105e	Ha! Well said, you dirty Kovolt!zts2106e	Cenil, stop!zts2107e	Patty, this is my business. It's got nothing to do with you!zts2108e	In the interests of the Kovolts and Darksies, Korrkoaren and I have signed a peace treaty. If the Catsies attack the Kovolts, I will not accept it!zts2109e	What? With these... these foul creatures?!zts2110e	Your Majesty... Your Highness... *sob*zts2111e	Kenel, you're chasing the Kenkos, too? In which case... I don't like it much, but why don't we work together?zts2112e	I can't work with Catsies!zts2113e	And what if this is Korrkoaren's will?zts2114e	Well, that's settled then. So let's go, go, go!!! We'll catch up with him in no time!!!zts2115e	Yes, I can feel it... the princess's heartbeat!!!zts2116e	Kenel? Where are you?zts2117e	Korrkoaren wants to reconcile with us. So be friendly to him.zts2118e	Here, below us, are the catacombs of the Shanera Dungeon.zts2119e	Okay, onwards.zts2120e	This place stinks of demons!!!zts2121e	Four paths lead to disaster, and only one is the path to life. Only those who find this path can overcome me.zts2122e	What does that mean?zts2123e	You must conquer eight mountains. Bear in mind, however, that I have very little patience.zts2124e	Oh, that's the Labyrinth of Pain!!!zts2125e	Labyrinth of Pain?zts2126e	People say you only get out of it by completing 5 challenges. This is the place in the old legend. Isn't that exciting?zts2127e	Pain is my middle name. Stick it out and survive!zts2128e	Enemies are approaching!zts2129e	In the name of honour, swear an oath to the shining sword!zts2130e	Watch out, something huge is coming our way!zts2131e	It's hopeless! Give up. Only your despair will save your life.zts2132e	Wh... what the hell is going on here?zts2133e	You guys are smarter than I thought. I didn't expect to meet you here.zts2134e	Give us Princess Catlotte back!zts2135e	The ritual has already started! You're late for the big show, haha!zts2136e	Fernon will awaken soon, and the closed Time-Space will be torn to tiny pieces. Then the path will be open.zts2137e	You scoundrel!zts2138e	Scream all you want! It has already started. The will of the Great Demon will be done. For the good of the father of all demons!zts2139e	(The demon vanishes... Does that mean all is lost?)zts2140e	We cannot give up now! We need to find Kenko! We must rescue Catlotte!zts2141e	Patty, I have to ask you something.zts2142e	Why? Why do you want to save Princess Catlotte?zts2143e	What? ... What do you mean? It's obvious...zts2144e	Hmm... you still don't know anything about it... the Darksies...zts2145e	Cenil! Stop it! Shut up!zts2146e	Don't we all have the right to know the truth, Little Miss Liar?zts2147e	No tempt me!zts2148e	Okay - and this is no joke - you need to know that the Darksies long for Fernon's rebirth.zts2149e	Grrrrrr!!!zts2150e	So why are you trying to rescue Catlotte then? I thought you would be the first waiting desperately for the ritual to be performed.zts2151e	Don't go jumping to conclusions. What I want - no, what the Darksies want - is to fulfil the Mother Erenia's will... and she wants to communicate with the world. Fernon is Erenia's gift to us, and with her blessing, she will wake from her deep sleep.zts2152e	*sigh* Why are you trying to stop Kenko then? I don't understand you! I can't accompany any further.zts2153e	That's not true. The demons don't want to revive Fernon. They're transforming her into a devil tree, making her a pathway for demons to pass through from Hellord!zts2154e	What does it matter? If Fernon is awoken, the result will be the same whichever way. Don't you see that?zts2155e	No, it's different! The original, true Fernon never had any devilish powers and never would have put any lives in danger.zts2156e	Haha... You Darksies! You're always twisting and distorting the truth. I'm leaving now, but I'll promise you one thing: the next time I see you, my sword will be coming straight for your throat. (Cenil laughs scornfully.) Be seeing you!zts2157e	I... I don't know. But let me ask you just one question... Do you really want to rescue Catlotte?zts2158e	Of course.zts2159e	If you really mean it, I will follow you. Kenel, what about you?zts2160e	If my master gives me a command, I follow it.zts2161e	It's never ending!zts2162e	Get out of here, quick! We have to find Kenko as fast as possible!zts2163e	So you came.zts2164e	Where is Princess Catlotte?zts2165e	She's undergoing the ritual. It has already begun.zts2166e	Kenko! Why did you betray us? Why did you throw away your pride?zts2167e	... I didn't have any other choice. Our land, Kreano, has already seized by the demons. They would have killed me if I hadn't followed their orders.zts2168e	What... what?zts2169e	You can hate me. You can kill me. Even after my death, I deserve to be cursed. However...zts2170e	Traitor! Get out of my way!zts2171e	No, I can't... For the sake of my brothers, I cannot let you pass.zts2172e	Then we will all die!zts2173e	No one may enter here until the ritual is over.zts2174e	*grrr* You traitor... You should have known that it would end this way!zts2175e	... Please, I have one last request.zts2176e	Please spare my brothers. They are innocent.zts2177e	Okay... You may go...zts2178e	(Kenel's sword pierces Kenko's chest!)zts2179e	Kenko Flailman...zts2180e	Now it not the time to be sentimental! Hurry!zts2181e	Cenil!zts2182e	Die, you demons!!! Die!!!zts2183e	Die, you demons!!! Die!!! DIE!!!zts2184e	Come on, don't stand around here! Princess Catlotte is just beyond here!zts2185e	You... can't... you can't do that...zts2186e	Please... save the princess!zts2187e	Cenil!zts2188e	Please, I'm begging you... rescue the princess!!!zts2189e	Cenil!!! Cenil!!!zts2190e	Please... I can't hold them back much longer... please go now... rescue... the princess... AAARGH!zts2191e	Will you help her?zts2192e	Let's go now. We need to rescue the Princess of the Catsies.zts2193e	Yes... you're right!zts2194e	Kenel... thank you so much!zts2195e	(Thick, foul-smelling smoke rises. Catlotte is standing in the middle, surrounded by demons. They are performing the ritual.)zts2196e	Stop that!!!zts2197e	Did we make it?zts2198e	Oh no... we're too late!zts2199e	This Time-Space is completely twisted!zts2200e	(Catlotte sighs with exhaustion.)zts2201e	Sister!zts2202e	Now... now everything is fine again. You arrived just before sealing ritual was completed. Now Fernon is sleeping again.zts2203e	Is... is it all over now?zts2204e	(The sound of footsteps approach quickly from somewhere... they sound like giant footsteps.)zts2205e	A monster!zts2206e	Oh no! While the Time-Space was open...zts2207e	It's... it's all... over.zts2208e	Oh, Cenil...zts2209e	Ah...zts2210e	Is it all over? Has Fernon been sealed?zts2211e	No... he's just sleeping again.zts2212e	But if that's the case, why don't you just seal him again? Hurry... start the ritual to seal him completely!zts2213e	It's too late. We cannot seal her. Fernon awakes with the blood of the Kovolts, and sleeps with the blood of the Catsies. Now that she's tasted the blood of both of us, she only moves of her own will. There's nothing more we can do now.zts2214e	If... if that's so, does that mean he will wake up sooner or later?!zts2215e	Don't worry. As long as Fernon is not awoken as a demonic tree, nobody's life will be in danger.zts2216e	But even then, all pathways into this world will be open. That would throw the world into turmoil!zts2217e	If that... if that is Erenia's will...zts2218e	Well... no one can say who is right and who is wrong...zts2219e	One thing sure is... this is the dawn of a new era.zts2220e	(Cenil... I kept my promise.)zts2221e	What did you say, sister?zts2222e	Oh, nothing... I didn't say anything.zts2223e	Was our adventure a success or a failure? All we are left with is a feeling of emptiness and sorrow. Many died, but nobody knows who was on the right side. Fernon... are you the gift of the divine Mother Erenia, or a symbol of demonic power?zts2224e	Pyjama Quest Start Conversation 1zts2225e	This Soulstone allows you to get the Pyjama Specialist Card.zts2226e	Oh! Are you the legendary Pyjama Fairy?zts2227e	Boohoohoooo...zts2228e	Boohoohoohoohoooo...zts2229e	Hey!zts2230e	Boohoohoohoohoohoohoohoooo...zts2231e	Hey!zts2232e	Wah! You gave me quite a fright!zts2233e	What's giving you so much grief?zts2234e	My blanket...zts2235e	It's completely filthy!zts2236e	Argh!zts2237e	Your Highness... *sobbing*zts2238e	Oh, that's no reason to cry. It can be cleaned no problem, and then...zts2239e	You!zts2240e	What is it? What did you do?zts2241e	So you mean I have to carry on sleeping on this filthy blanket?zts2242e	No, I just meant...zts2243e	I feel so bad and you dare to insult the Pyjama Fairy?! I curse you!zts2244e	Arghhh!!!zts2245e	Muhahaha! Well, how do you feel?zts2246e	Hm? Nothing happened?!zts2247e	Clearly you're not very smart.zts2248e	What are you talking about?zts2249e	Do you know what lies ahead of you?zts2250e	You will now suffer my curse for a hundred years.zts2251e	Arghhh!zts2252e	My curse will teach you the true meaning of suffering!zts2253e	What?! What have you done to me?zts2254e	You're in for the worst pain! And there's nothing you can do about it!zts2255e	What?!zts2256e	Enjoy your suffering! Mwahahahahahahaha!zts2257e	Hey! That's completely unfair!zts2258e	Unfair?zts2259e	Yes, unfair! It's anything but fair...zts2260e	Oh, you talk too much. Get me a new blanket if you don't like it!zts2261e	Do you hear me? Bring me a new blanket. See you!zts2262e	Pyjama Quest Interim Conversation 1zts2263e	You lazy bum!zts2264e	What's eating you?zts2265e	I wonder. I need a new blanket!!!zts2266e	Why do I have to...zts2267e	Blanket! Blanket! Blanket! Blanket! Blanket!zts2268e	Pyjama Quest Start Conversation 2zts2269e	Okay! Here's the blanket.zts2270e	*sigh*zts2271e	So, now you have your blanket, free me from this curse!zts2272e	Hey! It's really bad, especially in the mornings. Please lift this curse!zts2273e	Hm... Only for that...zts2274e	Do you think that'll give me a good night's sleep?zts2275e	What? What on earth are you talking about?!zts2276e	If I had a nice, soft pillow...zts2277e	Hey!zts2278e	Okay, deal! Go now.zts2279e	Pyjama Quest Interim Conversation 2zts2280e	If I only had a pillow...zts2281e	Arghhh...zts2282e	What's the matter?zts2283e	Pyjama Quest Start Conversation 3zts2284e	So, here's the pillow!zts2285e	What is it now?!zts2286e	Do you really think this will bring me a nice, relaxing night's sleep?zts2287e	*sigh* What do you want now then?zts2288e	I've just realised that I don't have a bed.zts2289e	Hey!zts2290e	I need a bed. Can you fetch me one?zts2291e	Pyjama Quest Interim Conversation 3zts2292e	Fetch me a bed... please! And stop complaining all the time! You wouldn't want to make me any angrier now, would you?zts2293e	Pyjama Quest Start Conversation 4zts2294e	Okay, here's your bed!zts2295e	Oh, what is it now?!zts2296e	Really?! How am I supposed to have a pleasant night's sleep on such a hard bed?zts2297e	Hrm! Why are you interrupting me?zts2298e	Just release me from this curse! Just a second, what are you doing?zts2299e	Bah! I'm going to teach you some manners!zts2300e	What?zts2301e	I'm going to give you a lesson for your insolence! Get ready for Pyjama's worst curse!zts2302e	Arghhh!!!zts2303e	Mwahahaha! How do you feel now?zts2304e	Erm... Hm? Nothing happened?zts2305e	Hahaha... You don't feel anything now, but your suffering will only get worse...zts2306e	!!!zts2307e	And you will now have to bear it for a thousand years!zts2308e	Arghhh!!!zts2309e	Ah!

I give up...zts2311e	Pyjama Quest Interim Conversation 4zts2312e	Would you prefer a few more years?zts2313e	Pyjama Quest Start Conversation 5zts2314e	Here's the mattress!

What are you up to?! Aren't you afraid of suffering from this curse for ten thousand years? Arghhh!!!zts2319e	How about ten minutes of ferocious violence...?zts2320e	Release me or you're dead.zts2321e	Okay.zts2322e	I'm serious!zts2323e	I believe you.zts2324e	Grrr, you make me so angry!!!zts2325e	Please, please, don't beat me!

I am the prince of the neighbouring kingdom.zts2336e	Yeah, of course you are... in your dreams perhaps!zts2337e	It's the truth. I was cursed by a wicked witch...zts2338e	Erm... Really?zts2339e	Really! A hundred years ago, she turned me into the Pyjama Fairy. All these years I couldn't remember my previous life... I fear I have done some terrible things.zts2340e	Argh... My head's buzzing...zts2341e	I am really very thankful. You are my hero! Thanks to you, I'm no longer under the curse of that wicked witch. Please accept this gift.zts2342e	Erm... What kind of card is that?zts2343e	It's a Pyjama Card. It'll bring you luck. Now it is time to bid you farewell.

Oh!zts2352e	There's something white over there... It's the skull of an elf!zts2353e	Hey, skull! Did you just say something to me?zts2354e	Haha! Pick me up...zts2355e	(You pick up the skull.)zts2356e	Ha! I'm free!!!zts2357e	Arghh!!! You scared me!zts2358e	Thank you. Nobody has seen this face for a thousand years.zts2359e	Who are you?zts2360e	I once was a human like you. But now I am a vengeful spirit.zts2361e	I will never forget what you have done for me. However...zts2362e	However?zts2363e	I can't just disappear like that.zts2364e	Forgive me. I require your services a little while longer! As soon as I've had my revenge, you will be free.zts2365e	What? What are you doing?zts2366e	The adventurer becomes dizzy for a moment. When the feeling is gone, he sees before him a Time-Space Piece.zts2367e	Warrior: Forgive me... my rage gradually drains your ability to regenerate. Please sever the chains of my grudge. Find the Powerless Dust King... that evil creature. Only his blood can save us all.zts2368e	Speak to the Soulstone again and enter the Time-Space.zts2369e	Warrior Quest Interim Conversation 1zts2370e	It's too early to find me...zts2371e	Warrior Quest Start Conversation 2zts2372e	The Time-Space Piece...zts2373e	Haha... That should be his heart.zts2374e	Hm? You don't mean... the Powerless Dust King, do you?zts2375e	My friend, come back!zts2376e	The heart bursts into flames!zts2377e	Uhhh... Am I tired!zts2378e	Welcome back, my brother.zts2379e	It's been a very long time... How can I show my gratitude?zts2380e	Don't thank me. Thank our friend here.zts2381e	Oh, hello!zts2382e	So this is the twerp who disturbed my sleep!zts2383e	Erm... What?zts2384e	You're lucky. If I had my bow and arrow in my hands, you would be dead already.zts2385e	Hm... Don't you think you're... overreacting a little?zts2386e	You haven't changed at all. But for me, payback time has come.zts2387e	Haha! What good is mourning after the past going to do us? We should be more concerned about finding our final resting place.zts2388e	Not the proud warrior you once were, huh?zts2389e	I am, but I'm just sick of senseless killing.zts2390e	A thousand years we've spent in eternal darkness... and that doesn't even make you angry? Shouldn't this elf pay for what he's done?zts2391e	Admittedly, the first hundred years were quite boring... But, well... I just got used to it.zts2392e	Don't try to avoid my question, my friend! Answer me!zts2393e	Have you forgotten everything? We fought against the Powerless Dust King and lost. And why did we lose? Because we were silly fools! What do you think has changed in those thousand years? Why would we be able to anything more against him now?zts2394e	This wretched elf feared our power... That's why he killed himself and trapped us in his body! Our souls were trapped in a thousand years of darkness! If we do not avenge this wickedness, we do not deserve peace!zts2395e	Hahaha! So who do you want to raise your sword against now? The innocent descendants of the elf?zts2396e	The Powerless Dust King... He is still alive...zts2397e	That sounds like a great fairy tale.zts2398e	It is the truth! I know because I was in his skull. He isn't dead. He just trapped us inside his body!zts2399e	He may have lost this body, but not his life. And now the two of us have reawakened...zts2400e	Hm...zts2401e	He has already regained two thirds of his body.zts2402e	You don't have to join us if you don't want to.zts2403e	Okay.zts2404e	I want to see the face of this elf.zts2405e	Haha...zts2406e	Hey, you!zts2407e	Yes?zts2408e	Here, take this.

I will burn you and wipe you off the face of this world!zts2420e	Calm down, old chum!zts2421e	Haha... You haven't changed at all over the last thousand years, have you?zts2422e	What's happened? Are the thousand years over already?zts2423e	How about I explain everything to you in peace and quiet?zts2424e	The Powerless Dust King! Where is he? Tell me! I will destroy him! I will smash him to pieces! I will scatter his ashes in all four winds from the highest mountain!zts2425e	Haha... That's enough! Be quiet. We will meet him soon.zts2426e	The head, heart and bones of the Dust King are beginning to unite...zts2427e	A beam of light is coming from the head, the heart and the sword.

He will feel my thousand-year grudge...zts2440e	Yes, kill me.zts2441e	Any final words?zts2442e	The last thousand years... it was such a long time... I am fed up with it now.zts2443e	Fire bolt!!! Hey! Why are you interrupting me?zts2444e	I told you to be patient!zts2445e	Haha... With my death, everything is over. Stop arguing.zts2446e	Tell us the reason. Why did you imprison us for a thousand years?zts2447e	So many of our tribesmen fell victim to you. I was afraid of your power.zts2448e	It was you who attacked first!zts2449e	We did not attack you. And even if we had... how could we have prevented this war?zts2450e	They were hard times for us too. It was all about survival.zts2451e	That's why I sealed you. Nothing other reason than that.zts2452e	That's it. Kill me now.zts2453e	Why wait any longer? Do it!zts2454e	Why are you smiling?zts2455e	That doesn't matter anymore. Let's get out of here.zts2456e	What? Are you completely insane?!zts2457e	It's over. I just wanted to see the face of the Powerless Dust King one last time! Now, let's go back. This world is meant for the living.zts2458e	Yes... let's go back.zts2459e	What?! Why are you doing this?!zts2460e	He doesn't have any family left to protect... he has nothing more to live for... he just wants to rest...zts2461e	I still don't understand you! What on earth are you talking about?zts2462e	I don't want to give him the fragment.zts2463e	What is that supposed to mean? Ah!zts2464e	You fool!zts2465e	Hey, Powerless Dust King!zts2466e	I have endured a thousand years of suffering.zts2467e	The suffering will accompany you for much longer.zts2468e	Warrior Quest Endingzts2469e	Thank you, little warrior.zts2470e	Watch what you're saying!zts2471e	Damn it! Why?zts2472e	I'm afraid we weren't always completely fair with you. But for that, we will give you some very special gifts. We grant you our power and spirit!

I came here by accident.zts2477e	That's so sad. You look so much like him...zts2478e	Hm? Like who?zts2479e	Someone who is far more precious to me than my own life... But unfortunately...zts2480e	Oh no. I'm talking too much again.zts2481e	Okay... I won't ask you about it. But what are you doing here? And what kind of flowers are these?zts2482e	Oh, those are lilies. If I collect a thousand lilies, he will return.zts2483e	He... must...zts2484e	I have put my whole heart into collecting these lilies. If I collect a thousand of them, he is sure to return in spite of his heart of stone.zts2485e	Ah, yes... I understand...zts2486e	Now I'm just one hundred lilies short... Some of them seem to have disappeared somewhere. Why, I don't know.zts2487e	Hm... Maybe I could help you?zts2488e	You said you needed a thousand lilies, right?zts2489e	Yes... But I don't want to be a burden on you...zts2490e	No, no! It's no problem at all!zts2491e	Sorcerer Quest Interim Conversation 1zts2492e	When I'm surrounded by lilies, I feel so... calm.zts2493e	Sorcerer Quest Start Conversation 2zts2494e	Here you go... one hundred lilies.zts2495e	I am so grateful!zts2496e	Now he will soon return to you!zts2497e	I am really very thankful... but... but...zts2498e	What's the matter?zts2499e	Ah... What's happening? My tears...zts2500e	What's the problem? Please tell me.zts2501e	The lilies keep disappearing... I just cannot collect the thousand lilies I require...zts2502e	How is that possible?zts2503e	I don't know... It's as if somebody is trying to stop me from seeing him again...zts2504e	Oh, someone's here! Hey! Who's there?zts2505e	Who are you?zts2506e	You! You're the thief who keeps stealing my lilies!zts2507e	The suspicious person disappears into the shadows.zts2508e	Where has he gone?!zts2509e	He must have escaped through the gap in the Time-Space! Here, take this!zts2510e	Take this piece!zts2511e	Sorcerer Quest Interim Conversation 2zts2512e	Hm... He seems familiar.zts2513e	Sorcerer Quest Start Conversation 3zts2514e	It's over!zts2515e	Stop! I know this guy!zts2516e	Okay...zts2517e	I won't ask him why he killed him...zts2518e	Get lost!zts2519e	Go!zts2520e	Why... But I don't want to reprimand you for stealing my lilies. Now get out of here! Don't ever let me see you again!zts2521e	Why...zts2522e	Don't say anything!zts2523e	Why... Why didn't you punish me...?zts2524e	No, stop it!!zts2525e	The beautiful holy sorcerer runs away... The adventurer gradually loses sight of her... The assassin approaches very slowly.zts2526e	I know where he is.zts2527e	I want to save him. Please help me.zts2528e	What the... Why?zts2529e	Don't ask. Yes, he died by my hand. I am just a cold-hearted assassin. If I have a job to do, I do it. But he is so...zts2530e	He's a good man! I want to help him... Please!zts2531e	Why did you steal the lilies?zts2532e	These flowers cannot bring him back... If she finds out that even a thousand lilies won't do anything, she'll become desperate...zts2533e	He's trapped in a place that's even more terrible! My powers aren't enough to help him there. But you are much stronger than me! Please help me!zts2534e	A beam of light emits from his hand! Another Time-Space Piece!!!zts2535e	Sorcerer Quest Interim Conversation 3zts2536e	Please don't ask me any questions.zts2537e	Sorcerer Quest Time-Spacezts2538e	Uhhh...zts2539e	How are you feeling?zts2540e	Uhhh... Where... where am I?zts2541e	Open your eyes.zts2542e	Oh, thanks! Ah... It's you!zts2543e	Long time no see, Master.zts2544e	You evil assassin! Die!zts2545e	Stop it! You can't even stand upright!zts2546e	The Lady is waiting... Get out of here...zts2547e	How dare you! Shut your mouth! Uhhh...zts2548e	Excuse me...zts2549e	Sorcerer Quest Start Conversation 4zts2550e	Lady!zts2551e	Oh, you're finally here!zts2552e	Yes, Lady! Finally... finally...zts2553e	Today, I finally managed to gather one thousand lilies and my dream has come true... Oh... I'm so happy!zts2554e	I'm so thankful... for everything...zts2555e	Oh, I didn't do anything! I only...zts2556e	Oh, that reminds me...zts2557e	I can't find that assassin anywhere... Where could he be?zts2558e	Why are you looking for him?zts2559e	He helped me...zts2560e	This assassin...zts2561e	Since the day he murdered me, I've been wandering around as a ghost... But I was soon captured by an evil spirit.zts2562e	What?zts2563e	He revealed everything to me. The order to kill me led to the downfall of my family... But there was nothing I could do!zts2564e	Hey! Keep calm!zts2565e	This isn't over yet. The warrior! Hey, you!zts2566e	Yes?zts2567e	Bring him to me. I want to know the reason!zts2568e	Where will I find him?zts2569e	This will help you.zts2570e	It's a Time-Space Piece!zts2571e	I have to know why he saved me! And why he betrayed my family! I need to know everything! Please hurry!zts2572e	Take the Time-Space Piece!zts2573e	Sorcerer Quest Interim Conversation 4zts2574e	I just don't get it! Please help me!zts2575e	Signs of a struggle... There's someone lying on the ground... It's the assassin!zts2576e	Hey! Are you all right?zts2577e	I am... done for.zts2578e	No, don't give up! I will try...zts2579e	No! Please take care of the Master and his Lady... I am as good as dead... it doesn't hurt anymore.zts2580e	You know it's not so!zts2581e	I... love the Lady.zts2582e	When I got the order to kill the Master, I could have refused and killed myself... That would have been the only way of defying the order...zts2583e	Who gave you the order?zts2584e	The Master's uncle.zts2585e	I don't know why. But one thing is certain... His uncle, he is no human.zts2586e	But how could the uncle even give that order?zts2587e	He is the leader of our group.zts2588e	Don't think too much about it. I killed my Master. My only excuse is that I was just following my orders!zts2589e	Hm...zts2590e	No... I know what you're going to ask... Would I have stabbed my Master, even if I didn't love the Lady?zts2591e	I don't know...zts2592e	please answer me! Was I blind with jealousy?zts2593e	I don't know!zts2594e	I should have given my own life to protect my Master!zts2595e	I really don't know!zts2596e	The life of my Master is so much more valuable than my own! I should have protected him!zts2597e	Please, calm down!zts2598e	Master! Master! Please forgive me!zts2599e	The adventurer doesn't know what to say.zts2600e	Forgive me. I've said too much.zts2601e	The Master is still in danger. The evil spirit is on his tail. Hurry! There's no hope left for me, but you can...zts2602e	But what about you? It's too dangerous here. You could die...zts2603e	I'm already a dead man. But my soul will rise up. Haha...zts2604e	Please, don't give up.zts2605e	Why should I remain in this world any longer? For myself? For the Master? For the Lady? Just why...zts2606e	You're finished!zts2607e	Hahaha...zts2608e	You have sinned in the hearts of these people! This is unforgivable!zts2609e	Are you mocking me?zts2610e	Hey! I'm no human. I am a demon.zts2611e	What do you mean?zts2612e	Who gives you the right to judge my sins?zts2613e	You dare to question my motives?zts2614e	What? What are you talking about?!zts2615e	Do you always have a good reason to go hunting? Have you ever cried even just a single tear over the death of an innocent animal?zts2616e	Err... erm...zts2617e	At that time... I was seriously wounded... His uncle saved me. But now I am a demon. I have my own way to survive. I devoured up and too his place. After I devoured the rest of his family too, my survival seemed to be assured.zts2618e	They rescued you and took you in! How could you repay their kindness this way?!zts2619e	Hey! Forgotten already? I am a demon. Righteousness and kindness are your values, not mine.zts2620e	I will die soon. You are too strong and will defeat me. But that is of no matter whatsoever. Do you think I hate you for that?zts2621e	Haha... A demon!zts2622e	Hm... Just died!zts2623e	Please hurry! I must know the truth!zts2624e	And he... he escaped?zts2625e	Tell me!zts2626e	To be honest...zts2627e	And so they learned the full story. When they found about the death of the assassin from the adventurer, there was a long silence.zts2628e	That's all I have to tell.zts2629e	I have to leave now.zts2630e	Thank you very much!zts2631e	Thanks to you, too.zts2632e	I don't know how to say this...zts2633e	Go ahead, just tell me.zts2634e	Can you forgive him?zts2635e	He's dead. Now we know the reasons behind his deed. Hatred is of no use to anyone.zts2636e	Yes, I agree.zts2637e	Thank you. Now, I have to go.zts2638e	This is for you.zts2639e	What is it?zts2640e	Please take it as a thank-you. It will fill you with our strength and spirit. Perhaps this is also what he would want.zts2641e	Thank you.zts2642e	It is time to leave.zts2643e	Thanks... my hero... thank you very much!zts2644e	The two ghosts slowly disappear... The adventurer's heart becomes heavy... What could be the source of this sadness?zts2645e	Yellow Soulstonezts2646e	A real adventure seems to lie beyond this Soulstone.zts2647e	When you touch the stone, it feels like you're being pulled into it. (Level 27+)zts2648e	Stretch your hand out.zts2649e	Leave it.zts2650e	Red Soulstonezts2651e	We feel a raging fury!zts2652e	Just what happened to the souls in this stone? (Level 36+)zts2653e	Leave it.zts2654e	Blue Soulstonezts2655e	It is blue and shimmering. It seems to emit a profound sadness.zts2656e	The souls in this stone have probably been trapped in the depths of suffering for a long time. (Level 46+)zts2657e	Raid Dialoguezts2658e	What a stench! It smells like rotting food!zts2659e	Mysterious Person: Arghhh!zts2660e	Arghhh! What the hell?!zts2661e	Mysterious Person: Please help me!zts2662e	Who are you?!zts2663e	Mysterious Person: Nnnngh... Please... please... is nobody there?zts2664e	Where are you? Hold on, I'm coming!zts2665e	(An empty room. In the centre of the room, there's a lifeless body.)zts2666e	He's not been dead for long...zts2667e	The demons just keep coming... We can't hold them back for much longer...zts2668e	Watch out!!!zts2669e	It's not safe here!zts2670e	Come on, follow me!!!zts2671e	Rays of light emit from the Magician's body. The portal will open soon...zts2672e	This way!zts2673e	You fool!zts2674e	What? What are you talking about?zts2675e	I missed her because of you!zts2676e	You had no idea about it and yet you still came here?zts2677e	What are you talking about?zts2678e	Mother Cuby... Ever heard of her?zts2679e	There's a new, evil creature that's been prowling the area around NosVille for some time... Some crazy mages summoned it and the NosVille guards have been hunting it ever since. And now you turn up and ruin everything!zts2680e	I just heard screaming and wanted to help...zts2681e	If you hadn't turned up, the magic field would still be intact... then we wouldn't have any victims to bemoan!zts2682e	I'm really... very sorry!zts2683e	Ah, it's okay. I should have thought about all eventualities.zts2684e	I am so sorry, Sir!zts2685e	Don't call me Sir. I just look very mature for my age...zts2686e	I have to hunt down Mother Cuby. She's been weakened by the magical field. I should be able to capture her single-handedly.zts2687e	Can I give you a hand?zts2688e	Yes, you can. Keep your eyes open around here while I create a new magical field. And above all:zts2689e	Do not attack under any circumstances!zts2690e	I'm serious! If you're not in the mood to die, do not fight this monster under any circumstances!zts2691e	What? What the...?!zts2692e	Run for it! Run away!!!zts2693e	Sir... What's happening now?zts2694e	No time to talk! I'll take care of this! Now run!zts2695e	Sir?zts2696e	Come on! And I'd already told you not to call me that!zts2697e	Sir!zts2698e	You fool! I can't fight if you keep getting on my nerves!zts2699e	Arghh! That's it!zts2700e	Why are you still here? Get out of here!zts2701e	S... Sir!!!zts2702e	Don't call me Sir again! Just go away!zts2703e	Argh!!! Mother Cuby again!zts2704e	You slow, stupid snail!zts2705e	Sir!!!zts2706e	Why don't you just get lost? Quick! Hurry!!!zts2707e	(You hear coughing.)zts2708e	*cough* I'm so happy to see you.zts2709e	Are you all right?zts2710e	Not really...zts2711e	That thing... that Mother Cuby... Have you killed it?zts2712e	Hehe... Not really...zts2713e	So... you missed it then?zts2714e	Ha... Not really.zts2715e	What do you mean?zts2716e	Here, take this.zts2717e	Grab the sealing stone!zts2718e	What's that?zts2719e	The Mother Cuby is sealed inside this stone.zts2720e	So you were successful then!zts2721e	Not really. The magical field was too weak...zts2722e	This stone still isn't secure. If the Mother Cuby somehow manages to escape from it, the world will be thrown into turmoil!zts2723e	What should we do then?zts2724e	Kill the monster before it breaks free!zts2725e	How should I do that?zts2726e	My time is up. You are the only person who can take care of this. You will need the help of your friends in NosVille to defeat that monster. The stone will show you the path to the place where I captured the Mother Cuby. Good luck! I am very pleased to have met you...zts2727e	Sir!!! No, come back!zts2728e	I have told you not to call me Sir!zts2729e	Sir! Sir!zts2730e	Deepest darkness descends gradually over the dead.zts2731e	It looks like a real massacre. The Kovolt miners lie mutilated in their own blood. What happened here?zts2732e	Kovolt 1: Uhhh...zts2733e	Kovolt 2: *cough*zts2734e	Kovolt 3: Uhhh...zts2735e	The bodies of the Kovolts lie everywhere. The stench of rotting flesh fills the air.zts2736e	Kovolt: Uuuhhh...zts2737e	Hey! What happened here?zts2738e	Kovolt: Mandragora...zts2739e	What?!zts2740e	Kovolt: Mandragora... Urgh...zts2741e	Hey! Hey!zts2742e	Kovolt: ...zts2743e	He's dead...zts2744e	Kovolt: Hey, human...zts2745e	Kovolt: Don't go any further inside...zts2746e	What on earth happened here?zts2747e	Kovolt: Mandragora...zts2748e	What? What are you talking about?zts2749e	Kovolt: Walking Mandragora...zts2750e	Walking Mandragora?zts2751e	Kovolt: *wheeze* NosVille... Lord Cuarry... The end is nigh... *wheeze*zts2752e	Hey!zts2753e	Kovolt: *wheezes* Get out of here, or the Mandragora will snatch you!zts2754e	What is that???zts2755e	Mysterious Person: I will never forgive you. You're mine!zts2756e	Who are you? And where are you?!zts2757e	Mysterious Person: I will devour you... nice and slowly!zts2758e	Where's that coming from?zts2759e	Mysterious Person: I will rip you into tiny pieces!zts2760e	You don't even have the guts to face me!zts2761e	Mysterious Person: Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!zts2762e	Hmmm...zts2763e	Haha! Now things are getting interesting.zts2764e	Something's not right here!zts2765e	Can we find the truth with... that thing?zts2766e	Yes. We have to try at least!zts2767e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: I'll meet you there.zts2768e	Oh, what happened?zts2769e	Be careful! There are rumours of strange happenings in the mines... I'm sure there's something not quite right going on there.zts2770e	Why are there so many Mandragora in the mines all of a sudden?zts2771e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: And what's worse is they are moving...zts2772e	Do you know what could have caused this?zts2773e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Originally, this entire area was covered with fields of ginseng.zts2774e	Hmm?zts2775e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: That was a long time ago. Then the mines were dug there and these Mandragora suddenly started showing up...zts2776e	And then?zts2777e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: That's all I know about it. I've never seen so many Mandragora.zts2778e	You're going down!zts2779e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Look out!!!zts2780e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Arghhh!zts2781e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Looks like that Mandragora poisoned me!zts2782e	How can I help you?zts2783e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: I need the antidote.zts2784e	Where can I find it?zts2785e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: To render the poison of the Mandragora harmless, you need sugar beets. I need as many of them as possible! But first we need to get away from here.zts2786e	Mysterious Person: Halt! You are mine!zts2787e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Damn it!!!zts2788e	Wait! I'll take care of it!zts2789e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Ohhh?!zts2790e	I will bring you those sugar beets, whatever the price!zts2791e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Okay... I'm counting on you.zts2792e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Thank you... You saved my life!zts2793e	You're welcome!zts2794e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Now I need to inspect the northern mine again.zts2795e	No, you need a rest! I'll inspect the mine!zts2796e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: You'd do that for me?zts2797e	Of course!zts2798e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: Take this with you then!zts2799e	Take the Time-Space Stone!zts2800e	Captain of the NosVille Guards: I found it during the battle with the Mandragora. I wanted to take a closer look at it... Be careful!zts2801e	I will be. Don't worry.zts2802e	There's... just too many of them...zts2803e	Mysterious Person: You have no chance! Bwahahahaha!!! I will tear you to pieces! Muhahahaha!!!zts2804e	(Silence. Only the smell of the Mandragora seems to be getting stronger.)zts2805e	I should look around more.zts2806e	Why aren't you dead?zts2807e	Get over here! Let's end this here and now!zts2808e	Mysterious Person: I will not forgive you... I will never be able to forgive you!zts2809e	Where are you?!zts2810e	(Silence once again... and the pungent smell of the Mandragora.)zts2811e	Mysterious Person: Die!!!zts2812e	Where are you? Hold on, I'm coming!zts2813e	Giant Mandra: Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!zts2814e	The Giant Mandra disappears... A dim light shines from inside it... It's a ghost!zts2815e	*sigh*zts2816e	Who... who are you?zts2817e	*sigh* So much time has passed.zts2818e	And nobody remembers us anymore.zts2819e	?zts2820e	200 years ago, I was a farmer in NosVille.zts2821e	I don't understand...zts2822e	200 years ago, Lord Cuarry's ancestors excavated the ginseng fields and built underground mines.zts2823e	We couldn't stand it and so we tried to fight them. But in the end we were defeated.zts2824e	Lord Cuarry's Knights killed us and buried us here. However, we cannot leave this world until our souls have found peace.zts2825e	Which means?zts2826e	Haha... That means the Mandragora are creatures created from our thirst for vengeance.zts2827e	Thank you very much! You have freed us from the curse after such a long time.zts2828e	That... was not my intention. I only wanted...zts2829e	Haha! No, no! Your courage is my salvation! I'm very grateful!zts2830e	You have made us very happy.zts2831e	But I must ask you for one more favour, brave adventurer.zts2832e	Just tell me what you want. I will do what I can.zts2833e	There are other victims. Many of my old friends are still suffering under this curse. Please release them from their pain too...zts2834e	I will do everything in my power to help them!zts2835e	Thank you very much! Please take this.zts2836e	Ginseng... Have you heard of it?zts2837e	It's an enormous monster formed from all the sacrificed farmers. You won't be able to defeat it alone. Find courageous companions and join forces against it. If you work together, you'll be able to destroy the monster and rescue those poor souls.zts2838e	I will rescue your friends! I promise you!zts2839e	Thanks! Thank you so much!zts2840e	This is the Forbidden Altar! Nobody is allowed to touch it.zts2841e	Did... did I touch it?zts2842e	Grrrrr!!!zts2843e	Arghhh!!!zts2844e	Get out of here! Run!!!zts2845e	Oh... What happened?zts2846e	Mysterious Person: Hahaha!zts2847e	Who are you?zts2848e	I didn't expect to meet anyone in a place like this. Haha!zts2849e	Who... who are you?zts2850e	A curious idiot like yourself who's got themselves into a bit of a pickle.zts2851e	There's no escaping this room. I've been stuck here for five year already.zts2852e	Five years?! You... you must be kidding! There's nothing here! No food and not even a drop of water!!!zts2853e	You fool! This is the Room of Eternity. There's no need to sleep or eat here... We cannot die in this room because we don't age here.zts2854e	You've got to be joking!zts2855e	Hey, I can attest to it... Well, it's not that bad. It's just rather dull.zts2856e	Oh... My goodness!zts2857e	But now we will spend that time together. Let's be friends!!!zts2858e	Don't say that! I will definitely escape this place!zts2859e	Hahaha... Muhahahahahahahahaha!!!zts2860e	Don't laugh like that!zts2861e	This room is closed, yet at the same time open.zts2862e	What do you mean?zts2863e	Here!zts2864e	A portal has opened where the Catsy was pointing!!!zts2865e	Try it out for yourself if you don't believe me...zts2866e	Hm... There doesn't seem to be an end to it!!!zts2867e	So just give up!!!zts2868e	You!!!zts2869e	Follow me.zts2870e	Give up. I made this room out of magical fields. There's no way out.zts2871e	The real Room of Eternity is over there. It's teeming with monsters. I created this one to protect myself.zts2872e	You?zts2873e	At least we're safe here. For ever...zts2874e	No!!! That cannot be!!! Let me out of here!!!zts2875e	(Monologue) When l look back on my life so far, it hasn't been that bad - just really boring. Five aimless years have now passed... What might be coming our way now?zts2876e	*clatter*zts2877e	Ouch!zts2878e	Hahaha! What's that?zts2879e	Another idiot like me!zts2880e	Who are you?zts2881e	An idiot like you whose curiosity has got him into a bit of a pickle. Hahaha!zts2882e	There's no escaping this room. I've been stuck here for five year already.zts2883e	Five years?! Are you joking?! Not even I, the strongest Kovolt warrior, could bear it for that long!zts2884e	You fool! This is the Room of Eternity. There's no need to sleep or eat here... We cannot die in this room because we don't age here.zts2885e	At least say something sensible!zts2886e	I can attest to it. Actually, it's not all that bad. Just very boring...zts2887e	But anyway, let's be friends from now on!zts2888e	Don't say that! I will definitely escape this place!zts2889e	Don't laugh like that!zts2890e	Muhahahahahaha!!!zts2891e	You filthy Kovolt... This room is closed, yet at the same time open.zts2892e	Oh, you're a Catsy!zts2893e	I will accompany you. Just follow me!zts2894e	Just give up.zts2895e	You?zts2896e	Follow me!zts2897e	(Monologue) When l look back on my life so far, it hasn't been that bad - just really boring. Five aimless years have now passed... What might be coming our way now?zts2898e	Shut up!zts2899e	Oh, sorry.zts2900e	Don't say things like that. You're depressing our new friend.zts2901e	Haha, probably... Time flies so quickly.zts2902e	*clatter*zts2903e	What's up now? Why does everything keep repeating itself?zts2904e	Mysterious Person: Ouch! That hurt!zts2905e	You guys stay here! I want to take a closer look at that.zts2906e	Ha! Just as I'd expected. A human, a Kovolt and a Catsy...zts2907e	Who are you?zts2908e	You unworthy creature... Spare me your stupid questions!!!zts2909e	Let's kill him!zts2910e	Say that again!zts2911e	Okay! Attack!!!zts2912e	Ha!!!zts2913e	Let me finish him!zts2914e	No, stop it! This guy... he knows something about us!zts2915e	Okay, then let's listen to him. Tell us what you know!zts2916e	What did you mean earlier? Why were you expecting us?zts2917e	What do you know about us?zts2918e	Start talking... or we'll kill you!zts2919e	Go on then, kill me!zts2920e	No, no, no! Calm it down!zts2921e	Haha! We demons aren't like you. We don't beg for our lives. Never.zts2922e	Come on, let's finish him!zts2923e	Stop it! Hey, demon! Is there any reason why we can't know the truth?zts2924e	Ha! Not really.zts2925e	Then start talking! Come on!zts2926e	This place is...zts2927e	Don't act all coy!!!zts2928e	Hey, you stinky Kovolt! Get your stink out of my face.zts2929e	What? You...zts2930e	Stop it!zts2931e	Right, this place is... the grave of Dark Castra.zts2932e	Dark Castra?zts2933e	Dark Castra will wake up again soon, and you will be sacrifice for his rebirth.zts2934e	What?!zts2935e	You imbecile... That's the key to breaking the door. Now Dark Castra's coming.zts2936e	Oh! Dark Castra...zts2937e	Who's that?zts2938e	A crazy sorcerer.zts2939e	That's all?zts2940e	I don't know anything else either.zts2941e	That crazy sorcerer has gone completely mad. He will destroy the entire world.zts2942e	Oh... my...zts2943e	What actually brought you here?zts2944e	I wanted to watch the portal-opening ritual. I was actually hoping it'd be a bit of fun. Hehe... What I hadn't expected was you putting up so much resistance. My mistake...zts2945e	What will happen to us when the ritual is over?zts2946e	I don't need to tell you that.zts2947e	Answer me! I asked you what will happen to us!zts2948e	You won't be needed anymore.zts2949e	Oh, so that means the long, boring 15 years of imprisonment will be over?zts2950e	*giggle*zts2951e	Hey! Now, what do you think about that?zts2952e	Be quiet. Hey, demon! How many years have passed in the outside world?zts2953e	Five years in here are three days out there.zts2954e	Oh, really?zts2955e	What are you up to anyway?zts2956e	Carry on with the ritual.zts2957e	Hey! Have you gone completely insane?zts2958e	*giggle* Now I can finally say farewell to this place.zts2959e	You said that the world would be in big trouble if Dark Castra wakes up!zts2960e	Yes, so what?zts2961e	What do you mean?zts2962e	I don't care for world peace... it's completely worthless... My freedom is more important to me.zts2963e	If we don't get out of here anyway, it doesn't matter to us at all whether the world is at peace or at war...zts2964e	If you carry on being so annoying, we'll overpower you and clear off out of here!zts2965e	Damn...zts2966e	Hey, demon. Keep on going.zts2967e	Ha! If that's what you want... follow me.zts2968e	We're almost there!zts2969e	Here.zts2970e	Go ahead!zts2971e	*giggle*zts2972e	Hey! Please!!!zts2973e	The demon starts to glow. One after another, they gradually lose consciousness... Where are we?zts2974e	Uhhh... Where am I?zts2975e	Ha! Back in your world.zts2976e	Oh! The spell has been broken!zts2977e	Yes... Hahaha!zts2978e	Damn...zts2979e	If you want to protect the world, you must defeat Dark Castra.zts2980e	And where is this Dark Castra?!zts2981e	Here, take this.zts2982e	What's that?zts2983e	It will lead you to Dark Castra. You won't be able to defeat him alone. But if you can find some other fools, you might be able to pull it off.zts2984e	And... why are you helping me? You wanted this world to be destroyed, didn't you?zts2985e	Demons don't like good souls, Erenia. NosVille will be destroyed...zts2986e	Don't worry, we have nothing against you. We just want to watch you suffer from chaos, betrayal and pain.zts2987e	What?!zts2988e	Muhahahaha!!!zts2989e	(The demon disappears in a cloud of smoke... It all seems to have been nothing more than a dream.)zts2990e	A swarm of spiders is attacking... Is there any way out?zts2991e	What... what is that?!zts2992e	Here we are.zts2993e	Ah... Korrkoaren... What are you doing here?zts2994e	Spiders keep coming to Mount Krem and attacking the Kovolts. There weren't nearly as many of them before.zts2995e	This place... looks very dangerous.zts2996e	Spiders everywhere... Be careful!zts2997e	I have the feeling that we keep walking down the same path over and over... as if we're walking in circles...zts2998e	Too many spiders. It'll be hard enough getting out of here alive.zts2999e	Look out! Enemies!zts3000e	I just can't keep this up!zts3001e	Damn... If only there were a few Koaren Warriors here...zts3002e	Why? Have you got any idea?zts3003e	Not really... but...zts3004e	I'll handle them. Get yourself out of here!zts3005e	What do you mean by that?! I know the meaning of honour...zts3006e	It's not about that! Listen! You need to get out of here and fetch the Korean Warriors. There's no other way!zts3007e	No! I can't just leave like that!zts3008e	We'll both end up dead!zts3009e	Damn...zts3010e	Please!zts3011e	Okay, I'm going. I will never forget your bravery! Hang in there! I'm definitely coming back!!!zts3012e	Damn it! I don't think I can hold them off much longer!!!zts3013e	The spiders are everywhere!zts3014e	Korrkoaren!!!zts3015e	Oh! You're still alive, human?!zts3016e	Kenel, too!!!zts3017e	Right, let's get out of here! Quick!zts3018e	You've been through tough times.zts3019e	Ah, not really. We got quite lucky, anyway!zts3020e	As we'd expected, there's a Spider Queen hiding somewhere in this cave.zts3021e	A Spider Queen?zts3022e	Yes. All the spiders roaming around here at Mount Krem come from that Spider Queen.zts3023e	Then... we have to kill her.zts3024e	The problem is finding her, though. And she's also protected by gigantic Soldier Spiders. It'll be anything but easy.zts3025e	I'll help you!zts3026e	Right, so the Koaren troops will wipe out the spiders!zts3027e	But... where is the spider nest?zts3028e	Take a look at this stone.zts3029e	Take the Time-Space Piece!zts3030e	A Time-Space Piece!zts3031e	We can use this to find the Spider Queen! Let's go!zts3032e	Brothers of the Koaren! Destroy these evil critters!!!zts3033e	Kovolt 1: They're retreating!!!zts3034e	After them! Don't let them escape!!!zts3035e	Master! I have a bad feeling. Don't you think that was a little too easy?zts3036e	What do you mean?! They're terrified of our troops. After them! Don't let them escape!!!zts3037e	Master! That's weird! They just disappeared all of a sudden!zts3038e	What?! Search the area! They can't have just disappeared like that!zts3039e	It's a trap! The spiders are coming from every direction! We must retreat!zts3040e	Damn... I can't see a way out!zts3041e	Look out! They're coming!zts3042e	Master! It's far too dangerous here! We have to run!!!zts3043e	Oh, you foolish human beings...zts3044e	Who?zts3045e	Your punishment will match the suffering that you have brought upon my family!zts3046e	Talking spiders?! This cannot be!zts3047e	Disgusting creepy-crawly! Where are you?! Show yourself!!!zts3048e	Your bodies will be the food of our young. Consider that an honour!zts3049e	You will never get near me, not even in death... The mother of all spiders... she's not interested in your lives. Nor is she interested in meeting you...zts3050e	Cut the crap and show yourself!zts3051e	Always remember the shame of this day...zts3052e	Master! Master!zts3053e	Arghhh... What happened?zts3054e	I don't know... When we came around again, we were here.zts3055e	What about our brothers?zts3056e	Only the three of us survived.zts3057e	That is worrying!!!zts3058e	Yes... This monster is just hideous!!!zts3059e	I will seal the entrance to the cave.zts3060e	But will that make any difference?zts3061e	It's far too dangerous to leave it over, at any rate.zts3062e	And how are you going to seal it?zts3063e	I will block off the entrance to this place.zts3064e	Hm... Kenel?zts3065e	What is it?zts3066e	Please give me one more chance.zts3067e	What chance?zts3068e	The Spider Queen... I just cannot forgive her.zts3069e	I have nothing against you sealing the entrance... But please just let me fight the Spider Queen one more time.zts3070e	It is far too dangerous.zts3071e	I know I can't do it on my own. But I can't just leave! In the name of all adventurers in NosVille! I want to fight her one last time!zts3072e	You have to promise me one thing.zts3073e	What?zts3074e	Never try it alone... never!zts3075e	Okay, I promise! Thank you!zts3076e	Kenel: Here, take this.zts3077e	As I said, I will seal the entrance. This stone will lead you to the monster...zts3078e	Yes.zts3079e	Please be careful.zts3080e	Where... where am I?zts3081e	Do not disturb our sleep.zts3082e	Slade: Do not disturb our sleep!zts3083e	I didn't see those monsters... I'd better get out of here.zts3084e	What? You again?!zts3085e	Slade: You shouldn't disturb our sleep...zts3086e	Who... who are you?zts3087e	Slade Priest: We are the ancient Slade people. Do not wake us.zts3088e	Slade?zts3089e	Slade Priest: Our despair... our sorrow... We buried it all. So stop irritating us.zts3090e	I want to get out of here! But I can't find a way out...zts3091e	Slade Priest: Please don't disturb our sleep.zts3092e	Hey!zts3093e	Slade Priest: Anyone who wakes us... will pay for it... with his life!zts3094e	What's that?zts3095e	What the heck is that?zts3096e	Is that a statue?zts3097e	Petrified Slade: We Slade are a people of ancient times.zts3098e	Arghhh! The statue can talk!!!zts3099e	Petrified Slade: We Slade are the faithful servants of Mother Ancelloan.zts3100e	Ancelloan? Not the one from the ancient legends?zts3101e	Petrified Slade: Ancelloan, the divine creator of this world and Mother of Erenia.zts3102e	And you? Are you really a statue?zts3103e	Petrified Slade: Ancelloan is the mother of the Slade. Her end is the end of the Slade.zts3104e	Hm... Sounds like he's talking to himself...zts3105e	Petrified Slade: The Slade are dead, but our sorrow still lives on. Massive Slade will come. Massive Slade will mourn the death of Mother Ancelloan for evermore.zts3106e	Massive Slade?zts3107e	Petrified Slade: We curse you. We curse this world. Die. You will all die. Everything will perish. No one can escape the dark fate of Massive Slade!!!zts3108e	The tombstone is also...?zts3109e	Now this will never end!zts3110e	Demon: Hey, human! Follow me!zts3111e	A way out!zts3112e	Why did you save me?zts3113e	Demon: Do you want to get out of here, human?zts3114e	Yes!zts3115e	Demon: I can help you do that.zts3116e	How?!zts3117e	Demon: Under just one condition.zts3118e	What do you want from me?zts3119e	Demon: Take this stone.zts3120e	Demon: It's the Stone of Slade.zts3121e	Why are you giving this to me?zts3122e	Demon: Enter the Land of Darkness with it, and destroy the tombstone there.zts3123e	That's the condition?zts3124e	Demon: Once the tombstone has been destroyed, this place will become distorted and transport you out of it.zts3125e	And just what are your intentions?zts3126e	Demon: I want you to fulfil my conditions. Will you do it?zts3127e	Demon: Decide now. Will you do it?zts3128e	If I fulfil your condition... what will happen to this world?zts3129e	Demon: Well.zts3130e	Demon: One thing is sure...zts3131e	Demon: The future of human beings is none of my business and is of no interest to me. Whatever happens to you, I don't care.zts3132e	So, what do you want then?zts3133e	Demon: I want the chaos of ancient times to be put to eternal rest. Something new should take its place.zts3134e	If it puts this world in any kind of danger, I won't do it!zts3135e	Demon: And if not?zts3136e	What do you mean?zts3137e	Demon: What if it meant you saved the world?zts3138e	Demon: Would you do it then or not?zts3139e	Do not try to deceive me.zts3140e	Demon: Great Demons never lie.zts3141e	Demon: Make a decision!zts3142e	Give me a clear answer: do I need to do this for the good of the world or not?zts3143e	Demon: Both paths are right and both are wrong.zts3144e	How is that supposed to work?zts3145e	Demon: Just make your decision! Will you do it or not?!zts3146e	Okay, I'll do it.zts3147e	Demon: Off you go at once then! Ensure that the ancient chaos is put to eternal rest!zts3148e	With a flash, the portal opens!!!zts3149e	Demon: That takes care of the last remnants of the Slade...zts3150e	Tell me one thing: is the Slade tribe... an enemy of humans?zts3151e	Demon: No. They are just an ancient people, dormant in deep despair.zts3152e	But why... should I do that?zts3153e	Demon: It is time to wake the Massive Slade.zts3154e	By eliminating the Slade, their deep despair will awaken a gigantic monster... Massive Slade.zts3155e	What do you mean?zts3156e	Demon: Massive Slade's despair will destroy this world!zts3157e	What?!zts3158e	Demon: Humans are powerless against Massive Slade... He will kill, destroy, and the world will return to its origins!zts3159e	You filthy demon!!! You lied to me!zts3160e	Demon: Demons do not lie.zts3161e	Demon: Sooner or later, Massive Slade would have woken up anyway. But the later that happened, the greater his strength. At some point, not even the gods would be able to subdue him.zts3162e	Demon: So, the humans' chances of defeating Massive Slade are greater while he is still quite young and his despair has not grown so large.zts3163e	Demon: You will now face your enemy 10,000 years earlier! So, I didn't lie to you!zts3164e	You... you...zts3165e	It was your own decision. You have to take responsibility for it now. Oh, and I saved your life.zts3166e	You... you demon!!!zts3167e	Muhahahahahahaha!!! Enjoy the chaos and the fear and the despair!!! This stone will take you to Massive Slade!zts3168e	Silence... fear... and deepest despair.zts3169e	No! Never! I can do it! I will conquer Massive Slade!!! I must summon my companions immediately! I need the power of all the adventurers in NosVille! I... I will... I will save this world!!!zts3170e	Rosebud Witchzts3171e	Mysterious Mage: Ha! I will observe you!zts3172e	The Mysterious Mage disappears suddenly.zts3173e	Oh, Catrisha! Are you all right?zts3174e	Oh, it's you.zts3175e	What's wrong?zts3176e	It's private, it's nothing to do with you.zts3177e	Okay... I understand.zts3178e	You all! Go after the Rosebud Witch! Search the area!zts3179e	Catrisha and the Blackshoe Knights are retreating.zts3180e	What was the name again? Rosebud Witch.zts3181e	Ah, you are the Rosebud Witch!zts3182e	Well done! But you are a human. Don't interfere in our affairs!zts3183e	The Rosebud Witch suddenly disappears.zts3184e	Give up, Princess of the Darksies.zts3185e	Damn it, I fell!zts3186e	Catrisha, what happened?zts3187e	Ha! That wayward kid managed to evade all the pursuing Blackshoe Knights. Hahaha...zts3188e	That really isn't funny!!!zts3189e	Hey, Princess! Nobody can help you out of here. Stop resisting and come with me.zts3190e	No, never!zts3191e	Give up, human. Okay, Rosebud Witch! Let's go!zts3192e	You're smart. Keep out of there, human! I don't want to kill you.zts3193e	No!zts3194e	Stop it! This is none of your business!zts3195e	Catsies do not like other species. But that's a Catsy matter. Okay?zts3196e	(Catrisha is dragged along by the Rosebud Witch.)zts3197e	Knight 1: Princess! Princess! Where could she be?!zts3198e	Knight 2: Oh no! The Princess has disappeared!zts3199e	Hey, you!zts3200e	Knight 3: Oh! You! Have you seen the Princess?zts3201e	Catrisha? She went with the Rosebud Witch.zts3202e	Knight 1: Oh no!zts3203e	Knight 2: Urgh!!!zts3204e	Knight 3: That's your fault!!!zts3205e	Forgive me! I tried to protect her, but...zts3206e	Knight 2: No... She is a mighty mage and commands the devil's energy. You cannot defeat her.zts3207e	Knight 3: We should still give chase! Quick!zts3208e	But what can we do?zts3209e	Knight 1: You can use this...zts3210e	And what is it?zts3211e	Knight 1: This is the emblem of Blackshoe Knights. We can use it to detect allies of the Blackshoe Knights!zts3212e	Knight 2: We have no time to talk! Let's be on our way!zts3213e	(A tedious and exhausting search for Catrisha... The Blackshoe Knights are probably already exhausted, too.)zts3214e	Are you sure this is the place?zts3215e	Knight 1: Yes, absolutely certain! The Princess must be somewhere nearby!zts3216e	By the way, who is this Rosebud Witch? Why has she kidnapped Catrisha?zts3217e	Knight 2: She's a brilliant mage. She was once very famous amongst the Catsies... But one day, she came to Catrisha and said she wanted to join the Darksies...zts3218e	Knight 2: I don't know exactly, but I guess she wanted to become even more famous. She probably thought she'd be able to achieve this goal easier with the Darksies than with the Catsies. The Darksies are more generous towards mages.zts3219e	I see...zts3220e	Ritter 2: Catrisha, however, didn't trust the Rosebud Witch... And the Rosebud Witch knew it. So she stole secret documents from the Blackshoe Knights and gave them to the Catsies.zts3221e	Knight 2: But as the Rosebud Witch also betrayed the Catsies, they don't trust her anymore. So the Catsies banished the Rosebud Witch... So now she's an enemy of both sides.zts3222e	Knight 2: If I only knew the true intentions of the Rosebud Witch...zts3223e	At least you can probably say that the Rosebud Witch hates Catrisha...zts3224e	Knight 2: You're probably right.zts3225e	Wait! Did you hear that sound?zts3226e	Knight 3: Watch out! Something's coming our way!zts3227e	Knight 1: The Knights of the Rosebud!zts3228e	Knight 2: The Knights of the Rosebud are here!!!zts3229e	Knight 3: Attack!!!zts3230e	Hey! That wasn't our original plan!!!zts3231e	Stop attacking!!!zts3232e	Knight 1: It's Cenil!zts3233e	Knight 2: Let's attack Cenil!zts3234e	Stop it! Have you forgotten that we have to find Catrisha?zts3235e	Hey, Darksies! If you lay down your weapons, we'll put an end to this senseless fighting!zts3236e	(Brief, busy activity... and then silence. The battle is over.)zts3237e	*sigh* What has brought you here, human?zts3238e	We are searching for Catrisha.zts3239e	Catrisha? Ah, I understand...zts3240e	Do you know anything about it?zts3241e	Okay, that's enough. Fare well, Darksies!zts3242e	The Knights of the Rosebud are retreating.zts3243e	Knight 1: What do they have in mind?zts3244e	Knight 2: Should we really just be letting them go?zts3245e	It's all right! We should get back to our search.zts3246e	No end in sight!zts3247e	Knight 1: Look at this! The emblem of the Blackshoe Knights is falling to pieces!zts3248e	What does that mean?zts3249e	Knight 2: It means the Princess is no longer here... or that something terrible has happened to her...zts3250e	Oh no... Let's get out of here then, fast!!!zts3251e	Could it be... a trap?!zts3252e	Knight 1: Probably...zts3253e	Knight 2: Is there no way out of here?zts3254e	I'm... I'm far too exhausted to fight!zts3255e	So, do you just want to give up?zts3256e	Hurry! Follow me!!!zts3257e	You're safe now.zts3258e	Why... why did you save us?zts3259e	I will explain. Your princess wasn't there. Someone knew you were looking for here and set a trap for you.zts3260e	Knight 1: Why should we trust you?zts3261e	Knight 2: What are your objectives?!zts3262e	It doesn't matter whether you trust me or not. Take this.zts3263e	Knight 3: That's the emblem of the Knights of the Rosebud!!!zts3264e	Use it to follow me. And perhaps... you might just see your princess again.zts3265e	Knight 1: ...zts3266e	Knight 2: ...zts3267e	Knight 3: ...zts3268e	Your faces say you don't trust me. Whatever, it's your choice. Bye!zts3269e	Cenil leaves.zts3270e	(Dark, muggy air surrounds you. Somehow, this place seems threatening.)zts3271e	Knight 1: Cenil... Did she deceive us?zts3272e	No, Cenil's not that mean.zts3273e	Knight 2: I hope you're right...zts3274e	Knight 3: Quite! Something's approaching!!!zts3275e	Phew...zts3276e	Knight 1: I've got a strange feeling!zts3277e	Not yet... Let's go over there and find it!zts3278e	Hm... I guess one of them is real...zts3279e	Knight 1: Be careful!zts3280e	Knight 1: That's... Cenil definitely deceived us!zts3281e	Knight 2: We'd better get out of here.zts3282e	But what about Catrisha? We have to protect her!zts3283e	Knight 3: ?zts3284e	We have no choice! We have to get through there!zts3285e	Knight 1: Yes... you're right.zts3286e	Knight 2: Okay, let's break our way through!zts3287e	Knight 3: Right! Let's go for it!zts3288e	Ha! You're late. I've been expecting you!!!zts3289e	Knight 1: Why did you go with the Rosebud Witch?zts3290e	I have my reasons.zts3291e	Cenil, what's going on here?!zts3292e	The Rosebud Witch is supposed to hand over Catrisha to me.zts3293e	Knight 1: She deceived us!zts3294e	Knight 2: We shouldn't have trusted Cenil!zts3295e	Knight 3: Damn you, Cenil!zts3296e	No! Let me put an end to this.zts3297e	Knight 1: Anything else you want to say to us?zts3298e	Your princess is safe now.zts3299e	What?!zts3300e	The Rosebud Witch is handing Catrisha in return for joining the Knights of the Rosebud. However...zts3301e	I refuse to cooperate with nasty assassins!zts3302e	Catrisha is already free, and my knights have arrested the Rosebud Witch. I'll hand her over to you. Whether or not to punish here will be your decision.zts3303e	Hahaha...zts3304e	Here, you Blackshoe Knights! Here's the Rosebud Witch!zts3305e	Don't say my name!!!zts3306e	An aura surrounds the Rosebud Witch!zts3307e	Cenil! Watch yourself!zts3308e	Oh no! I was too careless!zts3309e	I will never forgive you! You double-crossed me and dragged my name through the dirt.zts3310e	The Rosebud Witch is surrounded by demons!!!zts3311e	Where is the Rosebud Witch?zts3312e	She's gone already.zts3313e	Knight 1: Damn it!!!zts3314e	Knight 2: We almost had her!!!zts3315e	I'm afraid I underestimated the Rosebud Witch. But don't worry! I will teach her a lesson in the name of the Knights of the Rosebud!zts3316e	Catrisha appears.zts3317e	There you are.zts3318e	Knight 1: Princess!zts3319e	Knight 2: Princess!zts3320e	Knight 3: Princess!zts3321e	I'm fine! So don't worry about me! Oh, and Cenil...zts3322e	Thanks.zts3323e	I didn't intend to help you, so there's no need to thank me.zts3324e	Too bad the Rosebud Witch got away. But things aren't that bad either...zts3325e	Knight 1: We're waiting for your orders!zts3326e	We will hunt down the Rosebud Witch and teach her a lesson!!!zts3327e	Where are we?zts3328e	This place is...zts3329e	There's something strange about this place!zts3330e	That's the end...zts3331e	Really?!zts3332e	(Suddenly, the Rosebud Witch appears! Her body is glowing with bright light!)zts3333e	Holy wind!!!zts3334e	(The demons retreat slowly.)zts3335e	What are you looking at?zts3336e	Ah, I am very grateful anyway!zts3337e	Follow me, human! I know how to get out of here.zts3338e	Really? That's great!zts3339e	Don't talk so much. Hurry up.zts3340e	What brings you here?zts3341e	Why are the Rosebud Knights here?zts3342e	This is the trap set for us by the Rosebud Witch to take us out.zts3343e	Be that as it may... we will definitely catch the Rosebud Witch here! We're in luck!zts3344e	Quiet voice: Hey... Human...zts3345e	Quiet voice: I didn't mean for you to become entangled in this matter.zts3346e	Um... yes...zts3347e	Quiet voice: Be that as it may... I spared your life! Now you have to pay for that!zts3348e	Suddenly, the Rosebud Witch holds a blade to the adventurer's throat!zts3349e	Hey, Cenil!zts3350e	What are you doing?!zts3351e	Well, we don't have to fight. We're not enemies after all.zts3352e	He's got absolutely nothing to do with this! Just release him!zts3353e	Set me free and put an end to our fight!zts3354e	Now!zts3355e	Let her go.zts3356e	Quiet voice: Hey, little human! Thank you so much!zts3357e	Where are we now?zts3358e	This strange feeling... it seems familiar!zts3359e	There's something over there!zts3360e	You again! I don't know why you keep interfering in my affairs!zts3361e	Follow me, human.zts3362e	Catrisha!!!zts3363e	Why are you here?zts3364e	Could that be... another of the Rosebud Witch's traps?zts3365e	He can't deny it.zts3366e	Yes... probably?zts3367e	Hey, Rosebud Witch! Prepare to meet your doom!zts3368e	Quiet voice: This is all your fault, human. The trap would have worked without you. That's twice now that you've screwed up my plans.zts3369e	You won't get me anyway.zts3370e	(The adventurer blocks Catrisha.)zts3371e	Haha?zts3372e	It's over, Rosebud Witch!zts3373e	Blackshoe Knights! Arrest her!zts3374e	Catrisha, stop it!zts3375e	The Rosebud Witch has spared my life twice already!zts3376e	So what? This is a matter just for us Catsies. You'd better keep out of it.zts3377e	Maybe the Rosebud Witch isn't quite as evil as you think!zts3378e	The court will decide that!zts3379e	If you're planning to arrest the Rosebud Witch...zts3380e	???zts3381e	You'll have to get past me first!zts3382e	*sigh* Don't do this. This is very important matter to us Catsies.zts3383e	I am not saying that she can just go free...zts3384e	From now on, I will keep an eye on her!zts3385e	What do you mean?zts3386e	From now on, she will be my companion.zts3387e	She can't harm me anyway. And while you're with me, Rosebud Witch, you'll be safe from Catrisha and Cenil.zts3388e	Hm... Not a bad idea.zts3389e	Catrisha!zts3390e	Okay, retreat!zts3391e	Thanks, Catrisha!zts3392e	It's all right. And you, Rosebud Witch!zts3393e	You'd better not make any more trouble!zts3394e	(The Blackshoe Knights turn back and disappear.)zts3395e	Why did you save me?zts3396e	I don't know...zts3397e	Oh, that's funny. Ah well, at least we haven't lost anything.zts3398e	Yes, let's stick close to each other from now on.zts3399e	That won't be necessary. Oh, and you shouldn't trust me too much... Hehehehehehe!!!zts3400e	(Hm... Perhaps I should have just handed her over...)zts3401e	Note on ruinszts3402e	A boy's note:zts3403e	To Mum, Dad and all my friends in NosVille.zts3404e	This is Romeo. How are you all? I am doing well here.zts3405e	As you know, this place is rather cold and very quiet. The wizards here consider themselves the smartest of them all, so they hardly ever talk to me.zts3406e	Everyday life is monotonous, but it's not hard work, so I can't complain much.zts3407e	I'm also allowed to perform tasks for the Great Wizard Radal. That's a great honour.zts3408e	Sometimes he can be a bit pernickety, but overall he's a friendly teacher. Other boys have it tougher with their magic teachers.zts3409e	For example, once I accidentally broke Radal's marble ball, but he wasn't angry with me and he let me go... so I... (The paper is burnt at this point and you cannot decipher anything.)zts3410e	If I'm lucky, I'll even be able to do my apprenticeship with him. But for that, I'll have to go to the lower levels of the laboratory.zts3411e	The sounds that come from there each night... damned creepy. I can barely put it into words... it sounds like a demon's scream... (The next pages are burnt.)zts3412e	Experiment report - Introduction:zts3413e	We express our gratitude to the great Lord Cuarry and his family, without whom this experiment would not have been possible. I now report as follows:zts3414e	Experiment report - Summary:zts3415e	- This used to be the experimental laboratory of Duke, the legendary wizard. The magical powers of the Time-Spaces were analysed here. Today, Great Wizard Radal and team of wizards are working to reconstruct Duke's findings.zts3416e	- The Time-Spaces were created deliberately by someone. Some power tore apart time and space.zts3417e	- Through these chasms, we have access to a completely new world.zts3418e	- According to Duke's information, there are three areas, besides NosVille, where space and time were torn apart.zts3419e	- Time-Spaces developed in the affected areas.zts3420e	- A magical power, whose energy is beyond our imagination, streams out of these chasms. And like all powerful things, the magic of these Time-Spaces could destroy our entire world if used for evil purposes.zts3421e	- So far, we have not worked out the origin of this magical power that lies in these Time-Spaces.zts3422e	- We also have no idea who created the Time-Spaces.zts3423e	- Duke's ultimate goal was to make this power available to the entire world.zts3424e	- To gather more information, we are obtaining access to the buried floors below. The way down was closed off a long time ago, but we will soon obtain new insights.zts3425e	Medical record:zts3426e	Name: Romeo Whitezts3427e	Rank: Apprenticezts3428e	Symptoms: The patient has become increasingly impulsive and insane. The administration of wolfstooth led to a complete loss of personality. The patient developed a resistance to treatment with magic.zts3429e	Observations: This patient was previously deployed to waste disposal in Laboratory #7. Other than him, two other apprentices worked there.zts3430e	One hour after starting work, the patient suddenly had a seizure and bit his co-workers on the neck. One co-worker died immediately.zts3431e	Another co-worker put up a fight against the patient. However, he was also injured and it still bleeding heavily. Thus, his chances of survival are very low.zts3432e	Comment: The wizards who witnessed the accident confirmed that the patient had stronger powers of resistance to magic than is normal for a regular human being.zts3433e	Considering the fact that this is already the fourth case of this kind, I conclude that the patient was being demonised by a kind of mystical, evil power - even if I do not know how or why.zts3434e	Current condition: He has lost both his personality and his entire memory. A cure is impossible. I recommend ending his suffering.zts3435e	Letter to Great Wizard Radal:zts3436e	Dear Great Wizard Radal,zts3437e	I imagine you have already heard about the incidents that have taken place on the lower floors of the laboratory.zts3438e	So far, 15 apprentices have fallen victim to this "demonisation", all of whom have been put out of their misery. Together with all those who have been injured in these incidents, the total number of victims comes to 50 people. In addition, two wizards have had the same symptoms independent of each other, despite never having been down to the lower floors.zts3439e	If we ignore this, things will soon escape our control. I am sorry, but we should exercise greater caution from now.zts3440e	Over the last three years, we have gathered most of Duke's research work. However, we have not found any meaningful data for a year now. I think it is time to stop our work here.zts3441e	People are already talking about the accident here. They say that if we do not stop now, it will all end in a huge disaster.zts3442e	What we need now is a wise decision from you, the greatest of all wizards. Please protect us all with your great and powerful knowledge.zts3443e	Yours sincerely, Chief Wizard Ramias - Laboratory #5zts3444e	(An apprenticeship diary. It is dotted with drops of blood.)zts3445e	7th Novemberzts3446e	Damn it...zts3447e	They're all insane here. I need to get away from here. But how...?zts3448e	Nobody talks about it, but I'm not stupid. Romeo also went mad first and then died all of a sudden. Even Wizard Ramias doesn't look well. Who knows, perhaps everyone else has already gone mad, and I'm the only one left.zts3449e	I don't know why, but it seems like we're locked inside the laboratory. Are they going to kill us all? Not me! I will find an escape. I must get out of here... (The diary entry ends here.)zts3450e	(A memo. It was written in a hurry.)zts3451e	Divine Mother Erenia, protect us.zts3452e	Divine Mother Erenia, protect us from these demons.zts3453e	Research report of a wizard:zts3454e	Everyone knows the goddess Erenia. She rules over this world with immeasurable benevolence.zts3455e	But only few know Zenas, the Goddess of Spirit. Her name only exists in legends, and nobody worships her in this world.zts3456e	According to the legends, Zenas was an enemy of Erenia and was sentenced to death. But with the help of Duke, the legendary wizard, she lives on today as the Shadow of Zenas. Isn't that incredible?zts3457e	This shadow destroyed Duke. According to his research, he did not know it was Zenas. Duke feared the inexplicable power of the shadow, and he was in no way a match for its immense power.zts3458e	Now, after analysing Duke's report, we can say it was indeed the Shadow of Zenas.zts3459e	Yet, in spite of this threat, Duke continued his research on the Time-Spaces - with grave consequences. We, together with the Great Wizard Radal, have discerned where his efforts ultimately led... it ruined everything.zts3460e	Even though we don't know all the details, we do know that at some point, this mysterious and malicious power completely destroyed Duke and all his laboratories. And maybe even we, at this very moment, are being... observed... by this power...zts3461e	The curse of Zenas lies heavy on this laboratory... how else can the incidents in the laboratory and this stench be explained?zts3462e	Conversation transcript:zts3463e	Person A: Why do you no longer want to work in the laboratory?zts3464e	Person B: I saw a demon!zts3465e	Person A: There are no demons here. We're all a bit under the weather. Your mind is probably playing tricks on you. We'll take care of that for you, so you don't have to stop working here.zts3466e	Person B: I saw a demon. I'm sure of it!!!zts3467e	Person A: I've just told you that there are no demons here.zts3468e	Person B: It was a demon. A real demon! It's going to kill us all! It'll drive us ALL insane!zts3469e	Person A: Calm down. There's no demon here!zts3470e	Person B: You're going to die, too! It's... it's going to eat us all! But not until it's driven us all mad first!!!zts3471e	Person A: I can't let you leave now. You need to rest for seven days, and then I will make a decision on your case.zts3472e	Person B: No... let me out of here! It's coming... that demon is approaching!!!zts3473e	A mysterious note:zts3474e	The key has been found. As Wizard Radal said: the key is the source of the power. Unfortunately, out of all the groups of adventurers, only three members survived, myself included. The rest went mad and came after us.zts3475e	Radal's Testament:zts3476e	You always said it was the Shadow of Zenas. I laughed at you for that, but you were right. I know now that you were right. Even though my words might never reach you, I want to tell you how extremely sorry I am for ignoring your warnings.zts3477e	Everyone in this laboratory expect me has gone insane and become a 'guardian'.zts3478e	Ah, but your probably don't know what a 'guardian' is. It is the final stage of the disease. The patients didn't become insane, but the disease altered their thoughts. They are forced to protect this place.zts3479e	This guardians attack anyone who dares to enter this place. They can be very savage.zts3480e	Who did this? It was a demon. One thing is for certain: a demonic power brought this disease upon us. You are convinced that it was the Shadow of Zenas, but I refuse to believe that Zenas really exists.zts3481e	Whatever the case may be, all is lost now... Duke's research will never be published; it belongs to the guardians now. I very much regret it, but it's too late now for help.zts3482e	You might be wondering how I'm able to write this letter if I'm surrounded by guardians. But to be honest with you, I am also a guardian.zts3483e	I can barely manage to fight off the disease. The madness is slowly overcoming me, too.zts3484e	I remember you said you wanted to come back after two months. If you find my letter, please fulfil my final wish: if you find me, kill me. I don't want to have to roam this laboratory for all eternity like a zombie!zts3485e	I don't want to lose my mind and become someone else's puppet. I sincerely hope you find this letter.zts3486e	Congratulations. Well, our rookie adventurers have qualified to attempt the Level 18 Hero Mission!zts3487e	The Adventurers' Association has prepared a gift for Secret Partners.zts3488e	Clear the Level 18 Hero Mission and unlock the Secret Partners Time-Space Stone!zts3489e	This Time-Space Stone is only available to Secret Partners.

If you clear it, you will get one Medal of Friendship and will qualify for three gifts of friendship.zts3509e	???zts3510e	Keep it up!zts3511e	???zts3514e	Can you tell me something about it?zts3516e	Dark Castra... The legendary wizard Duke... My goodness...zts3518e	Anything interesting?zts3519e	You seem to have stumbled upon a way of freeing the Shadow of Zenas...zts3520e	Shadow of Zenas? Who or what is that?zts3522e	Really?zts3524e	What's that?zts3526e	Are you sure?zts3528e	I appreciate the information, anyway.zts3529e	For later use.zts3530e	Additional Dialoguezts3531e	Time-Space Tutorialzts3532e	Welcome to the lobby. You can use this location to prepare for your mission.zts3533e	Nothing can happen to you while you are here.zts3534e	If you want to team up with friends or family members for your adventurers, you can use the lobby as a meeting point.zts3535e	When you are ready, head to the door on the other side of the room.zts3536e	The creatures in the Time-Spaces are more aggressive than the other monsters you meet on your adventures. They will attack you on sight, so be on your guard!zts3537e	If you aren't strong enough to defeat the monsters in a room, you can also use an open door to flee into the next one.zts3538e	Just remember: sometimes all of the doors will lock as soon as you enter a room.zts3539e	In such cases you will have to defeat all the enemies in the room before you can open a door.zts3540e	Well done! The door is open again. Hurry into the next room.zts3541e	In some rooms you will find a lever. Using this will open locked doors.zts3542e	Oh, my apologies... It seems I forgot to mention a small detail. Some levers may open trapdoors which allow dangerous monsters into the room.zts3543e	If you activate a lever like this, you will immediately be attacked by bloodthirsty creatures, so stay on your guard!zts3544e	You will only have a limited amount of time available for some rooms. If you do not manage to defeat all the monsters within this limit, you fail your mission.zts3545e	The enemies in this room should be easy pickings. This is a tutorial after all!zts3546e	Time-Spaces are very unstable. You will not be able to stay in them for long. Don't waste any time and focus on finishing the mission as quickly as possible.zts3547e	If the time runs out before you complete the mission, you will fail. After failing a mission you will have to start again from the beginning.zts3548e	Do you see the clock and the stones at the bottom of the screen? They tell you how much time you have remaining for your mission. The stones indicate the number of minutes, while the clock displays how many seconds you still have.zts3549e	Oh no! While I was explaining all that, new monsters have appeared. Come on, be quick and eliminate them!zts3550e	Right, I've told you everything you need to know to get started with Time-Spaces.zts3551e	In the course of your adventures you will explore many more Time-Spaces. Some are full of hidden secrets and such treacherous dangers as you can't even imagine!zts3552e	But don't worry. I bet a brave adventurer like you will have no problems with the challenges ahead.zts3553e	Now let's get out of here. Come on!zts3554e	Help! I'm under attack!zts3555e	Oh no! One of the NosVille Guards is in trouble. Can you see that glowing aura around him? Allies with a glowing aura around them must not die, otherwise the mission will fail. Do your best and protect them well!zts3556e	Questzts3557e	Everyone here has there own power and skills that have been built up over time. You just haven't found yours yet.zts3558e	From now on everyone in the NosCamp is going to help you to develop your skills and teach you to wield your power.zts3559e	Let's get going - the enemy doesn't sleep! How about something simple to start with? Let's go!zts3560e	Congratulations! You've caught a chicken! Take good care of your new pet and don't underestimate it.zts3562e	*thinking*zts3563e	Malcolm? Hello?zts3564e	Maaaalcolm!!!zts3565e	Ahh! You scared me! What do you want?zts3566e	Mimi's told me a lot about you already. I'm here to equip myself for my adventure.zts3567e	Oh, I think I understand now... Alchemy.... it's all...zts3568e	Where were we? Oh yes, it's my task to supply the adventurers of NosCamp with any magical supplies they might need.zts3569e	Could you tell me what this alchemy thing is?zts3570e	(Hey, he's actually listening to me.)zts3571e	I'll tell you what alchemy is. So pay attention! Everything alive has magical power inside of it. Alchemy is used to discover this power and make it useful for people.zts3572e	We can produce lots of useful items using alchemy. We can reinforce items with it by giving them magical attributes. Apart from that, there are lots of basic magical materials that can be created. Do you understand?zts3573e	(Malcolm watches you thoughtfully.)zts3574e	I really do understand, don't worry.zts3575e	Thank you.zts3576e	(Malcolm watches you thoughtfully.)zts3577e	What's he up to?zts3578e	(Hmm... There's no point... I'll just leave Malcolm to his pondering...)zts3579e	Excuse me, Teo, but I have another question.zts3580e	What is it now?zts3581e	Could you tell me where I can buy something to eat?zts3582e	Try Eva Energy in the NosVille Market. You'll find plenty of good food there.zts3583e	Okay, thank you!zts3584e	So you're finally ready for your first proper adventure. Let's head off now then!zts3585e	(Mimi looks around, thinking.)zts3586e	And how about you? I could do this task instead.zts3587e	I don't really know, <pname>. That could be really dangerous.zts3588e	Don't overestimate yourself. It can be really dangerous for an inexperienced adventurer such as yourself.zts3589e	Plus I already said you can just rely on me.zts3590e	That's right.zts3591e	Please go to the NosVille Meadows and look after the pesky little animals.zts3592e	(You inform Mimi Mentor what happened in the Time-Space.)zts3593e	How can a small village like NosVille survive against such powerful creatures?zts3594e	If you use the right tool, you can create a lot of items yourself.zts3595e	Of course, how may I help you?zts3596e	No problem. I'll bring him the Delicious Lunch right away.zts3597e	Why?zts3598e	But there has to be a reason. Come on, tell me!zts3599e	Okay, if that's what you think. I'll set off at once.zts3600e	Mimi said you were looking for me. How can I help you?zts3601e	Okay, I'm here. How may I be of assistance?zts3602e	Yes, that would be very kind of you. *pondering*zts3603e	Oh yes, of course. Red Fruits are an ingredient. You can get them from those terrible creatures that make mischief in this area. *pondering*zts3604e	Could you be a bit more specific? Which creatures do you mean and where can I find them?zts3605e	(This Malcolm is driving me insane with his brooding.)zts3606e	You're back already? Thank you for helping me.zts3607e	My pleasure.zts3608e	But there's something I need to tell...zts3609e	What? I had to fight those horrid monsters to get the fruits. And now you don't need them anymore?zts3610e	Yes? Did someone just call me?zts3611e	Over here! It's me, Eva from NosVille Market. Could you come over here for a second, <pname>?zts3612e	No, I meant...zts3613e	Back already? That was fast! Well done!zts3614e	Is there no one else that can help you?zts3615e	What was that all about? Sounded like someone was screaming.zts3616e	Hey, <pname>, stay here. We weren't finished with our conversation.zts3617e	Welcome back, <pname>. The guards have told me that you've been doing some excellent work. They're all singing your praises. I am truly proud of you.zts3618e	Check the quality of your equipment and see if you want to do anything about your skills. When you're finished, come back to me.zts3619e	(Mimi seems too busy to listen.)zts3620e	Right, I'm here. What do you want from me?zts3621e	Miner 2: Very soon!zts3622e	(The Kovolts are speaking together excitedly.)zts3623e	Yes?zts3624e	Yes!zts3625e	Where do I need to go?zts3626e	Where should I go?zts3627e	Hey!!!zts3628e	I'll be back.zts3629e	You must have felt it when you were near the mines. The Kovolt miners are acting very strangely at the moment!zts3630e	What could it be?zts3631e	I don't know...zts3632e	Miner 2: Let's start!zts3633e	Miner 1: Right! So what are we waiting for?zts3634e	Miner 3: Count me in! Let's go!zts3635e	Is there really nothing we can do?zts3636e	Me?zts3637e	Sooo...zts3638e	Yes?!!zts3639e	Unfortunately I have bad news. Lord Cuarry doesn't want to make a bargain with the kovolts.zts3640e	Why not?... Why?zts3641e	He said that they're not worth trying to bargain with.zts3642e	What?zts3643e	Yes... NosVille was founded by Lord Cuarry. It's sad, but there's nothing we can do.zts3644e	I feel so unimportant...zts3645e	I don't want to do it, but I don't have a choice...zts3646e	You scared me! Who are you?!zts3647e	Oh... Do I have that?zts3648e	Hey!zts3649e	Hm?zts3650e	Bring me something I need! I'll give you a gift that you'll be able to make good use of.zts3651e	What are you talking about? Why...zts3652e	Don't stand around! Go!zts3653e	Okay, I'm going!zts3654e	Not sure why I'm doing this... He'd better have something useful for me when I get back.zts3655e	Your next challenge is already waiting for you! Let's see how quickly you finish this time.zts3656e	What is it?zts3657e	People have been hearing strange sounds coming from the mines to the west lately.zts3658e	Ah! The problem is no one listens to the sorrow of the world anymore.zts3659e	This world has lost its soul... Everything is losing meaning...zts3660e	??????zts3661e	Hey!zts3662e	Hm... Ah...zts3663e	What could be making those noises?zts3664e	Hm... What should I do now?zts3665e	Explore the Mine Plains. You'll find your fortune there for sure.zts3666e	Okay...zts3667e	I've got a bad feeling about this...zts3670e	Thank you, <pname>! Because of you, the village has become a lot safer.zts3671e	[[Mount Krem is the grave of Slade. The deep sleep in grave amplifies the sorrow of the Slade and passes it on to their descendants.]]zts3672e	[[Mother Ancelloan... oh, Mother Ancelloan... do not leave us...

Welcome to NosVille, our wonderful village!zts3684e	I am Mimi Mentor, one of the people that founded the village. It's lovely to meet you!zts3685e	It is my job to introduce new adventurers to the villagers.zts3686e	But there's no time to waste, our village is in danger!!zts3687e	NosVille is overrun with creatures of unknown orgins. Some of the villagers think that the creatures broke out of the Time-Space.zts3688e	It would take too long to tell you everything in detail now. But you must be curious to find out what's really going on. I'll explain things little by little.zts3689e	I'd love to help you, but isn't this a bit much for a rookie like myself?zts3690e	Oh, a new adventurer. Have a little look around the village and complete your tasks. I'll let you know if I need you.zts3691e	Fantastic! You mastered your first mission. Now it's time for you to retrieve your reward.zts3692e	Open the quest window and click on 'Rewards'.zts3693e	Then click on 'OK' to receive your reward.zts3694e	There are plenty of adventures out there that are difficult to master on your own.zts3695e	How about you get yourself a companion who will fight at your side?zts3696e	Companions can be pets or a partner, for example.zts3697e	As a NosMate, a well trained pet will remain loyally at your side. Let's go and catch you a NosMate!zts3698e	Let me just teach you a bit more about NosMates so you can understand how important they can be for you.zts3699e	A NosMate will support you during your adventures, no matter what. Try completing your next task with the help of your NosMate!zts3700e	The creatures around the village borders are not very strong. This makes them great for target practice. Let's train your pet by fighting these creatures.zts3701e	Oh... I almost forgot. Put this Training Uniform on before you head off - it's for your own safety.zts3702e	Did you get to see your NosMate in action? It's much safer to travel with your pet, than to travel alone!zts3704e	Never fear! I have a new weapon for you.zts3705e	Don't forget to collect your reward. Click on 'Rewards' in your quest window.zts3706e	You'll need to be able to fight a bit better before you can continue your quest.zts3707e	Did you know that we have a skill master here in the NosCamp who will train any adventurers who are eager to learn? He will teach you new skills and help you improve the skills you already know.zts3708e	His name is Calvin Coach, you absolutely have to meet him!zts3709e	Go over to him now, and he'll teach you and help you train your skills.zts3710e	Great to see you! Mimi Mentor has told me a lot about you already.zts3711e	My name is Calvin Coach. I'll be teaching you all of the skills you'll need on your adventures. If you want to improve, come and visit often.zts3712e	Don't forget that an adventurer needs lots of different skills to defeat monsters and complete their missions.zts3713e	How much is this training going to cost me?zts3714e	The price depends on the skill and type of training. As this is your first training session, I'll let you have it for free.zts3715e	Allow me to explain how we go about training you.zts3716e	That training was brilliant, I already feel much stronger than before.zts3717e	The good thing about this kind of training is that it's something you won't ever forget. I guarantee it!zts3718e	Thanks, Calvin! I'd like to try learning a few attack skills now...zts3719e	Let's get you warmed up before we train any further. How about you go and hunt?zts3720e	Once you've practised a little, I'll teach you some attack skills.zts3721e	You are better than the other new cadets. But don't be hasty. Concentrate on your training.zts3722e	Not bad! I didn't expect you to be so talented. As promised, allow me to teach you a few attack skills.zts3723e	Young adventurers such as yourself are taught the basic training for free. You'll have to purchase new skills later on.zts3724e	Take your training seriously and try to learn as much as you can. It's very important, especially for an inexperienced adventurer such as yourself.zts3725e	Wow, you're looking good! Your training is already paying off. Then you're finally ready to head out on your adventure.zts3726e	But before you go you should pick up some better equipment. The village shop should have everything you'll need.zts3727e	Begin by heading over to Malcolm Mix, the village alchemist. He'll be in the alchemy lab.zts3728e	Are you sure you're ready? You don't seem to be. Haha...zts3729e	Hello Malcolm, how are you? Mimi sent me.zts3730e	Oh really? *thinking*zts3731e	*thinking* Maybe...zts3732e	(Malcolm suddenly looks at you with interest.)zts3733e	Yes, I think so. Thank you for your help.zts3734e	Oh Malcolm, could you tell me where I can buy armour and weapons?zts3735e	You can buy armour and weapons over there in Teo's Tool Shop. Follow this street, you can't miss him.zts3736e	Oh, right... Wait there... I almost forgot.zts3737e	Teoman and his brother are twins. If you want armour you'll want to speak to Teoman, that's the one with the hammer. He's responsible for the armour and weapons.zts3738e	And what does his brother do?zts3739e	What do you want? Did Malcolm send you to me?zts3740e	Then you must be the new adventurer that Mimi Mentor is training. Am I right or am I right?zts3741e	Yes, that's me.zts3742e	Mimi already let me know you'd be dropping by. I'm supposed to give you this...zts3743e	A present? And you're sure you don't want anything for it?zts3744e	Just take it before I change my mind!zts3745e	(This Teo guy doesn't seem the friendliest, and he isn't interested in talking much.)zts3746e	A warm welcome to the NosVille Market, <pname>. Here you will find the freshest and tastiest goods, all top quality guaranteed.zts3747e	You're new here so I'll give you a one time deal: Your first purchase in the NosVille Market is on the house. Not bad, right?zts3748e	Feel free to have a look at my wares and choose something yummy for yourself.zts3749e	Thank you. That's really very kind of you. What's your name?zts3750e	I am Eva Energy, the leader of the market. I make sure that the hungry adventurers around here always have something fresh and tasty to eat.zts3751e	There you are. Did you manage to find some suitable equipment for your adventure?zts3752e	I'm ready, yes. And I didn't have to pay anything for this equipment.zts3753e	That doesn't surprise me. The people of NosCamp want to help make the start of your life as an adventurer as easy as possible.zts3754e	Let's go!zts3755e	Very good, then listen closely. Mysterious portals have been appearing in NosVille recently. These dark portals appear to be connected to Time-Space. Demonic creatures have come out of them and are causing a lot of trouble in the surrounding meadows. They're threatening our peaceful lives!zts3756e	Your first mission is to protect our village from these Time-Space creatures. We're counting on you! And you'd better hurry, there's no time to lose!zts3757e	I know this is a pretty dangerous task. But you look like someone who faces danger head on.zts3758e	The portals I spoke of are called Time Space Stones. These stones connect our world to the underworld via some mystical force. Nobody knows where they come from and why they've suddenly appeared in our world.zts3759e	All we know is that Time-Space can be entered through these stones.zts3760e	If you want to explore Time-Space you'll have to find the right stone and then enter the glowing circle that surrounds it.zts3761e	You'll find the first Time Space Stone in the northern part of the village. I'll explain more to you once you're there.zts3762e	You did a great job in the Time-Space. And your eyes are nice and bright. There's no doubt you're a true hero.zts3763e	I'd like to give you this adventurer clothing as a reward for doing so well in Time-Space. It has a special rarity level.zts3764e	A rarity level? Could you explain what that means?zts3765e	Of course: Some equipment items have a rarity level. The higher it is, the rarer and more valuable the item.zts3766e	If you right-click an item an information window will open displaying the rarity level of the item.zts3767e	Pardon me for intruding, but I've come here because I'm in desperate need of some help.zts3768e	Now then calm down, Sam. What is it that's worrying you like this?zts3769e	It's my job to patrol the NosVille Meadows, but my mother is suddenly very sick. I don't know how I'm going to do my duty and look after my poor mother at the same time.zts3770e	I'm hoping to find someone in the village who would take over my patrol for me.zts3771e	Let me think... Who could take over your work for a while? Hmm...zts3772e	I can do it. Trust me!zts3773e	Are you sure you're ready for a task like this?zts3774e	All I have to do is patrol the NosVille Meadows north of the village, right? Don't you worry about it, I'll manage that.zts3775e	Hm? Haven't you left yet?zts3776e	I'm glad you're back. I see you did well on patrol.zts3777e	By the way, I met one of the guards. I stood by his side and fought monsters.zts3778e	You helped one of my men? That's excellent news. Here, take this gift as a sign of my gratitude.zts3779e	Thank you, Sam. I'm happy to help.zts3780e	This adventurer is ticking all the right boxes, don't you think, Sam?zts3781e	Absolutely. He took over the patrol for me so I could look after my mother while she was sick. We could make good use of a competent person like them here.zts3782e	You're right. Just thinking about that cocky bloke who arrived here recently... he talked big, but then ran away from a girl wearing a disguise and carrying a wooden sword. I doubled up with laughter, let me tell you.zts3783e	Thank goodness all of them aren't like that. Most adventurers are plucky and brave.zts3784e	Could you perhaps do me a favour as well? These happy little Woolies have gotten quite overconfident lately and have started eating everything in the farmers' fields.zts3785e	If you're successful I'll have a suitable reward ready for you.zts3786e	These Woolies won't be a problem for me. You can count on me, Jim.zts3787e	Excellent! Then we have an agreement, young adventurer!zts3788e	Good luck!zts3789e	Well done! I'm starting to like you. Please take this improved wooden sword as a reward. I used this back when I was an inexperienced adventurer like yourself. I'm sure it'll be in good hands.zts3790e	Congratulations! You've gained a level since the last time we saw eachother. Did your chicken improve too?zts3791e	It's time you get your second pet. This time I'd like you to catch a happy little Wooly.zts3792e	Woolies are very brave and loyal animals. If you had one with you on your adventure, it would be of great help to you.zts3793e	Now let's make your family of adventurers a little bigger and get you a new NosMate!zts3795e	However, there is a small problem. You can only take one pet at a time with you on your adventure. That's why the happy little Wooly you caught isn't here right now.zts3796e	But don't worry. It hasn't gone, it's just waiting for you in Miniland.zts3797e	Go to Miniland and swap your current companion for the Wooly so it can join you on your adventure.zts3798e	I have the feeling that something terrible is happening nearby...zts3799e	It seems like it's getting more and more dangerous here. I'm really worried about the safety of this village.zts3800e	More and more reports from the villagers about the terrible monsters that are fleeing out of Time-Spaces and into our lands. It's almost as though these creatures have returned from the ancient legends.zts3801e	Don't worry about it too much, Mimi. NosCamp is full of the brave adventurers that you've trained. They can fight the monsters and help defend the village.zts3802e	I suppose you're right. There will always be hope for NosVille with fearless adventurers like you around.zts3803e	We need to get ready to fight! Please accept this gift. It will help you on your long journey.zts3804e	It's a special tool for adventurers.zts3805e	Try it out now.zts3806e	That worked well! You created a valuable item using the tool.zts3807e	However, this necklace is currently just a nice piece of jewellery.zts3808e	You can use special gemstones called Cellons to apply various enhancements to your jewellery. This will turn them into extremely powerful items.zts3809e	Ms. Style at the Fashion Boutique is the expert on this sort of thing. Go there and find out more about enhancements.zts3810e	Hello, <pname>. It's a lovely day, don't you think?zts3811e	True, but not nearly as pretty as you... Anyway... Mimi Mentor sent me to you so that I can learn more about jewellery enhancements.zts3812e	*blushes* Well then you've come to the right place. You'll find all kinds of jewellery to enhance with Cellon stones here.zts3813e	You're a new customer so I'll give you your first Cellon for free. Come in now if you'd like to call upon my services right away, otherwise you can drop by again later.zts3814e	Ah, <pname>, could you do me a little favour?zts3815e	I've got a lot to do right now so I can't really leave. Could you bring this Delicious Lunch to Calvin Coach please?zts3816e	The poor man is so busy that he forgets to have any lunch sometimes. That's not a healthy thing to do to yourself, so I thought someone should look after him.zts3817e	Ah... by the way. You don't have to mention that I sent you.zts3818e	It's not important or anything... but keep it to yourself, okay?zts3819e	Don't be so curious. It's got nothing to do with you.zts3820e	Hm... You're not going to eat that, are you?zts3821e	But it... it was on sale at the market.zts3822e	Hm... That sounds ridiculous!zts3823e	Oh, is it midday already? I lost track of time again. Thank you very much for the food.zts3824e	It's not me you need to be thanking. It's not from me...zts3825e	Haha... I know. This is a gift from Soraya, am I right?zts3826e	Erm... yes, yes it is. How did you know?zts3827e	Now don't look so surprised. I've been aware of Soraya's generosity for a long time now.zts3828e	Oh really? She didn't want me to tell you...zts3829e	I've put you on the spot somewhat. I apologise, I didn't want that to happen. Let me give you a few useful pointers before you go, to make up for it.zts3830e	It's not that big a deal, you knew about it already anyway. You don't need to apologise.zts3831e	Well that's a relief. But all the same, I'd like to teach you something important. After all, it's my job to advise and train the adventurers in NosCamp.zts3832e	I'd like to teach you about some additional skills, known as Plus Skills. You remember the basic skills you've already learnt? Well, plus skills are additional skills that enhance your basic skills.zts3833e	There you are. Malcolm Mix has been looking for you for a while. Could you go and see what he wants?zts3834e	Ah, there you are. That's right, I was looking for you. I have a little problem and could really do with your help.zts3835e	It's my job as the village alchemist to provide all sorts of magical items for the adventurers of NosVille. Last week I received an order for 100 healing potions, but I'm missing an important ingredient I need to be able to brew them.zts3836e	And you'd like me to get this ingredient for you, am I right?zts3837e	Malcolm!! If I'm going to get this ingredient for you, you'll at least have to tell me where I can find it.zts3838e	Where you can find it? To the north! Or maybe it was to the south? No, no, to the north... Yes, I'm pretty sure. *pondering*zts3839e	To be honest, I don't need this fruit anymore.zts3840e	I'm really sorry, but the order for healing potions has been cancelled because it was so overdue. So you can keep the fruit if you like. And as compensation for your efforts, I'll mix up a health potion for you, all right?zts3841e	Hey! <pname>!zts3842e	No problem. I'm on my way.zts3843e	I'm glad I caught you before you left the village. I've got a new task for you.zts3844e	Fire away. How can I help you?zts3845e	It's about ingredients.zts3846e	Which ingredients?zts3847e	Well, I heard you collected some red berries for Malcolm. He always needs a lot of different things to brew his potions.zts3848e	That's right... so?zts3849e	Well I also need a lot of different ingredients here in the market. At the moment I'm too busy to go out collecting everything myself.zts3850e	Couldn't you buy the ingredients you need from somewhere instead of collecting them yourself?zts3851e	You're joking, right? NosVille Market is the only place where you can buy these ingredients. And as I'm the head of the market, I'm the one that has to make sure there's enough in storage for everyone.zts3852e	Anyway, right now I need some Small Beans. Please go and get some for me.zts3853e	Hey, not so fast. I don't even know where to find these beans.zts3854e	Oh, of course! You can find small beans by defeating Pii and Pii Pods. Get me 5 of them to start with.zts3855e	All right. I'll set off at once.zts3856e	No problem, I'm happy to help. But I'll need to go now. There are a lot of things I need to get done.zts3857e	What? You can't just leave me like this. I still need you to go and collect ingredients for me.zts3858e	Sorry, no. It's difficult to find adventurers as helpful and friendly as you at the moment, you know?zts3859e	What's happening? I should go and take a quick look and find out.zts3860e	Calling all guards, adventurers and villagers of NosVille! A huge number of sinister creatures have gathered in the Time-Space to the north of the NosVille Meadows. These monsters are a threat to our lands and we suspect that they're going to start attacking soon.zts3861e	Great work, <pname>! We managed to thwart their plans, just in time.zts3862e	But keep your guard up all the same. This is still a very dangerous place. I wish I could accompany you further.zts3863e	That would be great.zts3864e	Go and see if everything is all right in the NosCamp Meadows and then return to the village. The people there should count themselves lucky to have such a brave adventurer as yourself in their midst. Thank you once again, <pname>.zts3865e	Go and have some rest and get yourself ready for your next task.zts3866e	You'll need a special item for your upcoming adventure. But first we'll need to create it.zts3867e	A special object? What are you talking about, Mimi?zts3868e	I'm talking about a Kovolt mask.zts3869e	A Kovolt mask? Why would I need something like that?zts3870e	I'm sure you'll find that out at some point. At the moment just think of it as part of making sure you're prepared.zts3871e	In order to create the Kovolt Mask, we'll need 6 Dander Seeds and four Seedle Leaves. You get Dander Seeds from weak Poison Danders, and the Seedle Leaves from defeating Fire Seedles.zts3872e	Do you have everything we need? Very good, I will put together the Kovolt Mask for you.zts3873e	Mimi, we have a huge problem!zts3874e	What's wrong, Calvin?zts3875e	The adventurers we sent to explore the Time-Space in the Mine Plains still haven't returned.zts3876e	We also haven't heard anything from the soldiers who we sent to try and find them.zts3877e	What bad news. Is there nothing that might give some clue to what's happened with the adventurers?zts3878e	Not so far unfortunately, Mimi. I think we have no other option but to send another troop of soldiers into the Time-Space. We need to find out what's going on!zts3879e	Please, let me take on this task. I won't disappoint you.zts3880e	Very well. You've already shown that you can be relied upon, <pname>. But promise me you'll be careful. I think something terrible may have happened.zts3881e	Don't worry, I can take care of myself. And in the name of all the NosCamp adventurers, I will find out what's happened.zts3882e	Good luck with your task. Perhaps you'll meet the soldiers that we sent into the Time-Space.zts3883e	It's over... I really did it!zts3884e	Hey you, adventurer!zts3885e	Hello? Who's calling for me?zts3886e	I'm over here. At the entrance to the mine. Come over here.zts3887e	I called you over because I'd like to ask a favour of you.zts3888e	What sort of favour, may I ask?zts3889e	Hey, what's wrong? Why are you looking at me so suspiciously?zts3890e	What are you expecting? It's night time, you pop up suddenly and call me over, and then I'm supposed to do you a favour? I don't even know who you are.zts3891e	You're an adventurer, aren't you? Well, unless I'm mistaken, you adventurers are always on the lookout for new quests and challenges.zts3892e	Well, you're right there. What's your point?zts3893e	What I'm trying to say is that an adventurer like you has to get used to accepting tasks from strangers. You are a real adventurer, right?zts3894e	All right then, I'll help you. What's the problem?zts3895e	Well, I've lost my wooden hammer.zts3896e	And that's why you need my help?zts3897e	The problem is that this hammer doesn't belong to me. Teoman Topp from Teo's Tool Shop lent it to me.zts3898e	Hm, Teo can be quite grumpy sometimes. How can I help you?zts3899e	I'd like you to retrieve this lost hammer for me.zts3900e	What do you want me to do?zts3901e	You heard me, go and get that hammer for me. Now, I didn't lose it out here - I lost it in the nearby Time-Space. And wild horses couldn't drag me in there again.zts3902e	So are you an adventurer, or what? If you are, then stop standing around here and being of no use. Off you go, help an innocent, hard working citizen of NosVille in their time of need!zts3903e	Excellent work! I knew you could do it! Now, hurry up and bring the wooden hammer to Teoman Topp in NosVille. If you don't get moving you'll take root!zts3904e	And why can't you do that yourself?zts3905e	You can see how busy I am. Come on, who else should I be asking for help?zts3906e	(I think I've just about had enough of letting this lazybones send me about the place. But never mind, at least I'll get out of this place quickly. This guy stinks, like he's been scoffing raw onions all morning.) All right... one more favour! I'll set off at once.zts3907e	Hello Teo. Mudog asked me to bring you your hammer back.zts3908e	Finally! I've been waiting for it for way too long. Give it here!zts3909e	Mudog lost this hammer. I had to go and find it for him, which took a while.zts3910e	What? What an unreliable bloke. Once I get my hands on him, he'll feel it!zts3911e	Not so fast, Teo! Nothing bad has happened. You have it back now.zts3912e	Harrumph, I suppose you're right. He's still earned himself a telling off for this sloppiness. *mumbling*zts3913e	Calm down, Teo. I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose. Well I need to head off. Good day to you.zts3914e	Great to see you. Are you all right?zts3915e	Yes, everything's fine.zts3916e	I was worried - you've been a while. I thought maybe you'd disappeared, like the other adventurers.zts3917e	No, I'm okay. I was just delayed. Mudog asked me to do him another favour.zts3918e	You already did something for him? And now Mudog already wants your help again. That seems like him...zts3919e	What?zts3920e	Yes, he asked me if you would be able to give him some more help.zts3921e	What?! Him again??zts3922e	Mudog can be a bit annoying sometimes, but he's not a bad guy really. Go and pay him a visit and he'll explain what he wants you to do. And take your Kovolt Mask with you. I think you're going to need it.zts3923e	Hoho! So I see you're still alive.zts3924e	Yes, I'm fine. And all I'd asked you to do was get this hammer!zts3925e	Muahahaha... I'm sorry if that caused you any difficulties. But nothing happened to you.zts3926e	All's well... I heard you want my help again.zts3927e	That's right. I'm glad you're here so quickly.zts3928e	Not so fast! I haven't promised you anything yet.zts3929e	Oh, come on! I'm really sorry about sending you about the place for that hammer... But this time it's about something really important!zts3930e	So, what do you say? You'll want to know what this is all about, right?zts3931e	Sure!zts3932e	I've had this bad feeling about the mine for a long time, like something isn't right there. These Kovolt Miners... I'm sure they're planning something...zts3933e	No one has ever been down there to check on things before... You've already proven you're brave. Would you go and sort it out?zts3934e	Yes...zts3935e	But how?zts3936e	With a disguise! If you dress up as a miner, then you should be able to go through the mine unnoticed.zts3937e	And how is that going to work? They'll see right away that I'm not a Kovolt!zts3938e	You clearly don't know about a Kovolt Mask's special powers, right?zts3939e	What special powers? I don't know what you mean... Tell me already!zts3940e	When you put on the mask, all the Kovolts will think you're one of them. Quite handy, right?zts3941e	And I'm meant to believe you? As soon as the Kovolts notice that I'm trying to deceive them, I'll be the one dealing with their anger...zts3942e	Whether you believe me or not, it's the truth.zts3943e	You're not trying to put me in unnecessary danger, are you?zts3944e	Of course not! The Kovolts will think you're one of them once you're wearing the mask. You've got nothing to worry about!zts3945e	Erm, I don't really know... Why don't you do it yourself, if it's so easy?zts3946e	Well, erm... That's, well... I just can't... *sniffs*zts3947e	(Is he crying? This can't be right...)zts3948e	Please! Go and find out what's happening down there! *sniffs* If you won't do it for me, then do it for NosVille!zts3949e	(Hm... I still have a bad feeling about this... But I'll risk it for NosVille.)zts3950e	Miner 1: When is it kicking off?zts3951e	Miner 3: Are we going to manage this?zts3952e	Miner 2: We just have to survive, then anything is possible.zts3953e	Hehe... I can't believe it, it works. They really think I'm a Kovolt!zts3954e	Miner 1: We need to explore this part of the mine. So many miners have been injured there, and some of them even lost their lives... We need to find out what's going on before something else happens.zts3955e	Miner 2: You're right. But who would volunteer for this task?zts3956e	Miner 3: Let's play rock, paper, scissors for it!zts3957e	Miner 1: Sounds good. Hey you, rookie! Come over here.zts3958e	Miner 1: There'll be no Kovolts skiving off here! That counts for you to! You have to play.zts3959e	Let's start. Let's play a round...zts3960e	Damn, lost! Well then I'll have to sort this thing out.zts3961e	Miner 2: Now then, don't make that face, rookie! You'll come back alive. Good luck!zts3962e	(If I refuse, I might blow my cover!) All right then, I'll get going...zts3963e	Miner: Now be quick! Remember, you don't have forever.zts3964e	Phew, finished! I should go back to the village and have some rest.zts3965e	Oh, erm... Do you have a bit of time?zts3966e	Oh, Malcolm!zts3967e	Well, my... Uncle... The imps... The house has been laid to waste...zts3968e	Oh... My uncle came home... And these wicked imps... Hm... My uncle must have... followed an imp...zts3969e	*sigh* One moment, please, I'll summarise. So, your uncle's house has been destroyed by imps. Your uncle went missing after chasing these imps. And you want me to find him. Right?zts3970e	Haha... Yes, that's right!zts3971e	Hm... I think... My uncle might be somewhere in Western Mine 1... It's risky...zts3972e	Um... yes... Don't worry too much about it. Just wait here. I'll do it!zts3973e	Oh right... I've got something... Might be useful...zts3974e	What is it?zts3975e	Oh... erm... sorry... But the Imp uses the shadow element... If you've got resistance to it, then the damage you suffer from it will be reduced...zts3976e	If you give me a pair of adventurer shoes... Then I can improve them for you...zts3977e	Ah, okay... I'll combine them together now.zts3978e	If you need more combinations... You can find me... any time...zts3979e	Oh, okay... Thanks.zts3980e	Malcolm must be worried. You should go back. Oh...zts3981e	Somehow I have the feeling that something's lurking about... Do you have any idea what that could be?zts3982e	I feel something too... As though something bad is approaching us...zts3983e	Uhhh... I'm really nervous!zts3984e	Miner 2: We're not working anymore! We're on strike!zts3985e	Miner 1: Strike! Strike!zts3986e	Huh?! The Kovolts are on strike?!zts3987e	I have to go and tell Mudog.zts3988e	What did you say?! The Kovolts are on strike?!zts3989e	That's right. If we'd known of their plans then maybe it wouldn't have gotten this far.zts3990e	Well we're not going to put up with this! We'll have to stop this strike right away!!zts3991e	Once Lord Cuarry hears about this, it'll be on me! I'm the one responsible for the mines, after all!!zts3992e	I'm not really sure what I should do.zts3993e	This is just so cruel... I have to tell Mudog.zts3994e	Oh, I'm too late. It's beyond our control now.zts3995e	Not only here, but also the Kovolts at Mt. Krem called a strike... Lord Cuarry knows about the strikes... Now everything is over...zts3996e	The people of NosCamp and these layabout guards have let me down. Why didn't they stop this before it got this far?zts3997e	(He's really getting angry now.) But there has to be a reason for these strikes. Maybe I can find out what's going on here.zts3998e	Ha, I don't care! All my savings, my pension - all gone! So much for my comfortable future.zts3999e	(There's no point talking to Mudog anymore. I'll just have to do something about this myself.)zts4000e	I've lost everything...zts4001e	The Kovolt Miner's strike is totally reasonable... But there must be some way we can come to a compromise... I should talk to Mimi about it!zts4002e	The Kovolts are on strike because they feel they're treated badly. Maybe you could talk to Lord Cuarry?zts4003e	All right, I'll let him know about the Kovolts' demands.zts4004e	Thanks, Mimi. I hope we can find an answer to this problem.zts4005e	I will do everything I can - trust me!zts4006e	Okay, I think I'll have a bit of rest.zts4007e	I'm sorry, but you won't be able to. There's always something to do here in NosCamp. I've got a new mission for you already.zts4008e	So, the missions are complete. I should go back to the village and ask Mimi whether there's any news about Lord Cuarry.zts4009e	Hello, Mimi! Any news from Lord Cuarry?zts4010e	Seems like the conflict is going to continue. Lord Cuarry will never forgive the Kovolts for rising up against him.zts4011e	Does NosCamp have to listen to Lord Cuarry, then?zts4012e	Hm... That's life.zts4013e	Its unfair! The meaning of life! Goodness and justice? Bah! Nothing but an illusion...zts4014e	The fight to survive and the survival of the fittest! That's what life truly is.zts4015e	But sadly... not everyone obeys the laws of nature. Some people talk about equality an want to convince everyone they're right.zts4016e	But an idea is just an idea. A dream, nothing more. Bah! Dreams! They're the seeds of all evil! Did you know that?zts4017e	Buffoons! Hunting for an illusion that will never be a reality! Foolish human beings!zts4018e	Hm? What do you mean by that?zts4019e	Ah, I've been fired...zts4020e	Oh, I see. You were just whinging about your job...zts4021e	The world has gone blind... People just don't see who wants to work anymore. I will raise above this world one day! Just you wait! You foolish buffoons!zts4022e	(What a ridiculous promise.)zts4023e	Hm... It's just missing the finishing touch. A little flair!zts4024e	Are you kidding me? I've got some cool moves.zts4025e	Hm... What do we have here?!zts4026e	Not bad... Not bad at all!zts4027e	Really? Is it really that good?zts4028e	Oh... Can't you tell?! It's like a pig wearing a pearl necklace. I'll give you another gift. Go.zts4029e	What... is that?zts4030e	I'm not sure you really want to learn anything. Why not use your menu window?zts4031e	Haha... That sounds fun.zts4032e	What is that?zts4033e	It sounds like a piece of music by Mozart... Hm... Words don't come close to describing this beautiful music...zts4034e	I just can't pull myself away from this music!zts4035e	What are you talking about? I don't hear any music!zts4036e	Hey! What is it?zts4037e	Hurry! We don't have much time!zts4038e	I need to have look around more closely...zts4039e	Hm... I have the strange feeling that something's wrong here.zts4040e	What's wrong?zts4041e	I'm here to collect the guard's weapon.zts4042e	Here...zts4043e	(He's still not very friendly.) Thanks!zts4044e	Hey, you!zts4045e	Strange things are happening here. Do you think you could help us?zts4046e	Of course!zts4047e	It's not a huge problem. We just need a few more people to help us keep an eye on the area.zts4048e	These enemies keep getting stronger!zts4049e	This creature had a strange Black Slate with it.zts4050e	What strange letters! I can't figure out the writing on this slate. Maybe Calvin can translate it.zts4051e	Hm, an interesting script. Just a moment... I think I might be able to understand what's written here.zts4052e	I took the slate from an Underworld Devil. So what does it say?zts4053e	Hmmm...zts4054e	(Silence.)zts4055e	The devils from these Time-Spaces want to attack our village. We have to warn the villagers!zts4056e	What?zts4057e	It's getting more dangerous by the day in NosVille.zts4058e	The monsters are attacking. They're everywhere! Quickly, we have to gather together and stop these creatures!zts4059e	It's already started....zts4060e	I'll help the NosVille guards!zts4061e	Everything is over. In the end we've been defeated!zts4062e	Don't lose hope. Most creatures have returned to the Time-Space.zts4063e	Yes, but not before plundering our land. And some of them are still wandering around here and threatening our citizens!zts4064e	I'll stay here and deal with these monsters.zts4065e	No! You won't be able to on your own.zts4066e	I've got to try, at least. You can't help me, you need to follow your orders and help the injured citizens.zts4067e	I'm sorry.zts4068e	*sigh* Is that enough?zts4069e	Hey! Are you all right?zts4070e	How's the village? Is it getting repaired?zts4071e	Yes, but it's not as badly damaged as we feared.zts4072e	Luckily the guards were able to keep the monsters back for a while. That gave the villagers enough time to get out, at least.zts4073e	Yes, their hard work in training has paid off!zts4074e	Greetings!zts4075e	You look so glum. What's wrong?zts4076e	Oh, I've been demoted because of this thing with the Kovolts.zts4077e	Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.zts4078e	Let's talk about it some other time. You know Bob, right? Maybe you've seen him around?zts4079e	No?zts4080e	He headed off a while ago to fight against the monsters and help a wounded guard. But he hasn't come back yet. I hope nothing's happened. You have to find him, do you understand?zts4081e	One more accident, and I'll be fired... hmmph...zts4082e	Calm down. I'll find him!!zts4083e	Bob headed north. But that's all I know.zts4084e	All right, I'll set off now.zts4085e	Thank you! Life can just be so unfair sometimes! *grumbles*zts4086e	You saved Bob? Thank you! I nearly lost my job because of these idiots. Just you wait until I see him!zts4087e	Yes... Hahaha.zts4088e	These guards are just too dimwitted. They overestimate themselves constantly and then complain loudly when things go wrong.zts4089e	Shut up, you big mouth!!zts4090e	Aaaaargh!zts4091e	He... Hello, how are you?zts4092e	Are you Mudog's troublemaker?zts4093e	What? Tr... Troublemaker?zts4094e	I heard that you're the reason the Kovolts are causing all this trouble. So what are you going to do about it?zts4095e	What's wrong?zts4096e	I'm responsible for the Western Mine 2, but the Kovolts there have gone completely crazy! You're not going to run away from that, are you? Take responsibility!zts4097e	Yes?zts4098e	You have to teach these dishonourable Kovolts a lesson!zts4099e	Where's Krispo?zts4100e	There... err... There's a small problem. Krispo is... err...zts4101e	Come on, tell me! What happened?zts4102e	Well... he followed you to see whether you were going to do your job properly. And then the Kovolts found him and have taken him prisoner. I'm really sorry... hahaha.zts4103e	No wonder he couldn't find me in such a huge, winding mine. Now we really have a problem!zts4104e	Buahahaha!!! What a shame! Poor thing! Hahaha...zts4105e	I don't see what there is to laugh about here, Mudog. This is serious!zts4106e	Yes, yes, all right. You're right. So what are you going to do now?zts4107e	I'm going to go and find him, of course!! I'm a NosVille adventurer after all!!zts4108e	No, please don't go. It's far too dangerous.zts4109e	I don't care! A real adventurer doesn't let danger get in the way.zts4110e	You're risking your life for someone you've never even met? That's insane! Be sensible!zts4111e	I've made my decision!! Goodbye, Mudog.zts4112e	No, stay here! Save your life!zts4113e	The Kovolts are still following us! Attack!!zts4114e	Attack!!zts4115e	Calm down!!zts4116e	Ah! Captain!zts4117e	The NosVille guards are on their way. We're going to attack the Kovolt base!zts4118e	The Kovolts are going to regret ever taking me prisoner. I'm going to beat them all on their behinds!zts4119e	Please, calm down! We need to stay calm and avoid letting our feelings lead the way forward.zts4120e	Hey... Krispo... It's nothing to do with settling personal scores!zts4121e	Tsk tsk... are you trying to give me orders, you dimwitted guard? If you'd been paying closer attention in the first place, then none of these horrible things would be happening to me!zts4122e	Please... Calm yourselves!!zts4123e	(The captain suddenly rushes over to Krispo and hits him. Krispo is unconscious.)zts4124e	I had to. He shouldn't have insulted me like that! Anyway, I'm going to march with my men to the south east. And you should follow once you're ready!zts4125e	Why am I being dragged into another fight? And what's going to happen with Krispo?zts4126e	Don't worry, he'll be all right on his own. There are much more important things right now! And we need all the help you competent adventurers can give us!zts4127e	All right, I understand. I'll follow you as soon as I can.zts4128e	Welcome back! What's that in your hand?zts4129e	What? Ah... You mean this?zts4130e	Hey, that's a fairy!zts4131e	This strange shiny creature... is... a fairy??zts4132e	Fairies aren't strange creatures, but they're certainly mysterious! They give their master new powers. I could explain more, but Eva is the expert at these things...zts4133e	Wow! A fairy!!!zts4134e	Mimi says you're the expert on fairies.zts4135e	Of course! The fairies are my friends!zts4136e	Oh really?zts4137e	That's right. I've known some of them since I was really small.zts4138e	What do you think of my new fairy?zts4139e	Take a look at your fairy. Is she glowing? She may look cute, but nothing could be further from the truth. There's nothing she loves more to do than eating, and it makes her very sad when she gets hungry. Make sure that you always give her enough nourishment. Don't forget!zts4140e	Hello! I'm looking for those with pure souls!zts4141e	Your eyes tell me a lot. Come here and take my hand!zts4142e	Are you talking to me??zts4143e	Yes, you closed the door to ignorance and have finally seen that you must listen to your heart. Come here and touch my hands!zts4144e	Are you sure that I'm the right person?zts4145e	Please come over here and touch my hands.zts4146e	But I barely know him. What could he want from me?zts4147e	The cursed sun is rising on the Sunny Meadows!!zts4148e	What are you talking about??zts4149e	The powers of evil are gathering around the cursed sun.zts4150e	Are you predicting that something bad is going to happen?zts4151e	Exactly!!zts4153e	Because only a hero can stop the darkness.zts4154e	(This guy is talking in riddles. Unless he's saying that I'm this hero?)zts4155e	More and more of these demons are appearing. Isn't it going to stop?zts4156e	Isn't it over yet?zts4157e	I think I've almost done it.zts4158e	Whoa!!! The devils are making a big circle!!!zts4159e	Oh my god! What is that thing in the centre?zts4160e	I've never seen something so gruesome before!! I have to tell everyone in NosCamp.zts4161e	(You describe what happened.)zts4162e	Hm, that sounds very serious. We have to do something!zts4163e	I wonder whether we're going to be able to defeat this threat on our own.zts4164e	I suspect not. We have to ask Lord Cuarry for help. His knights will be around the bridge to the south of NosVille. Go there and tell them what's happened.zts4165e	We're going to ask Lord Cuarry's Knights for help?zts4166e	Yes! They can help us defend NosVille.zts4167e	Hm... But they were sent to sort out the Kovolt strikes.zts4168e	The NosVille guards can't do this on their own. You have to talk to Lord Cuarry's men!zts4169e	Yes... we already know about that!zts4170e	Yes? Yes?zts4171e	Is there something else you want to say to me? If not, then this conversation is over.zts4172e	But this is really important!! Why aren't you doing anything about it?zts4173e	Be quiet! We will only follow our captain's orders. To us, orders are more important than life itself!! We're not doing anything without official orders from the captain!zts4174e	I guess I need to meet the captain then, where is he? Where can I find him?zts4175e	He's on patrol at the moment. He must be somewhere in Sunny Meadows.zts4176e	Who are you?zts4177e	Are you the captain of Lord Cuarry's knights?zts4178e	I am Captain Lance, commander of the third unit of Lord Cuarry's knights. What do you want from me?zts4179e	I have some urgent news for you!zts4180e	I've already been informed of this.zts4181e	Then give your people the order to help us! The NosVille guards can't keep this threat at bay on their own!zts4182e	No, I can't do that.zts4183e	What? Why not??zts4184e	I have my reasons.zts4185e	(Hm... Why can't he just tell me what the problem is?)zts4186e	The fresh air sure is good for the appetite. If only there was something sensible to eat around here!zts4187e	(Hm... I should find something tasty for him. Maybe I can learn more about him that way.)zts4188e	You're finally here with my food! Hey! Stay close and keep your eyes open so I can eat my breakfast!zts4189e	You mean... I should stand guard?zts4190e	Exactly! Just stand there and you can watch me enjoy my food!zts4191e	Hmmph...zts4192e	Ah... Did I upset you? Bwahahahaha!!zts4193e	No, no... That's okay...zts4194e	Ahhh... I'm full! That was certainly more than enough!zts4195e	I hope you liked it.zts4196e	I need a cigarette after such rich food... Hey! Where are my cigarettes? Did you see the box?zts4197e	No I haven't.zts4198e	Wait! There was a fox wandering around here! I bet he'll have my box of cigarettes! Go and deal with that beast and bring them back! What are you waiting for? That's an order!!!zts4199e	All done!zts4200e	Hahahaha...zts4201e	(I hope he doesn't have any more stupid little tasks for me...)zts4202e	Muahahaha...zts4203e	Is there anything else you want me to do?zts4204e	No... But I get the feeling that you want me to tell you something.zts4205e	The reason is Lord Cuarry!zts4206e	He's why I can't help you.zts4207e	What do you mean?zts4208e	Lord Cuarry won't let us march with you. He's preventing it.zts4209e	You heard me... Now get out of here!zts4210e	Oh, that reminds me... Do you know someone called Tom?zts4211e	Erm... No.zts4212e	He's around here somewhere... Talk to him. He might be able to help you...zts4213e	(This thing with Lord Cuarry is really strange... I suppose I should go and look for this Tom person!)zts4214e	Tom isn't the friendliest of people.zts4215e	Hello! How are you?zts4216e	You again? What do you want this time?zts4217e	It's about Tom.zts4218e	I've met him and I'd like to learn more about him.zts4219e	Well you've come to the wrong place. I don't know anything about him!zts4220e	But he's a knight, just like you.zts4221e	I don't want to talk about him. Go, buzz off!zts4222e	You want to know about Tom? Well, he's the finest of all of Lord Cuarry's knights. He's an unbelievably good fighter!zts4223e	Tom is one of Lord Cuarry's knights??zts4224e	Yes, that's right. They're all very strong and experienced men. However the NosVille guards are kept out of this circle.zts4225e	Hm... I heard something very interesting about that.zts4226e	Really? What?zts4227e	Lord Cuarry is the only reason that the knights are refusing to help. Captain Lance told me!zts4228e	Lord Cuarry pays these knights well. They're essentially soldiers. Unless he gives them the order to help us, they're not going to.zts4229e	But why would Lord Cuarry not want to let them help us?zts4230e	I don't know, I'm afraid. Only those trusted few who were at the secret meeting with Lord Cuarry will know.zts4231e	There was a secret meeting?zts4232e	Yes, but that's all I know.zts4233e	I want to find out more! I have to find where this secret meeting took place!zts4234e	That's easier said than done.zts4235e	Maybe you know someone who could help me? Lord Cuarry's knights say they want to fight this evil. But what are they doing? Nothing!zts4236e	You're right.zts4237e	So is there someone who can point me in the right direction, or not?zts4238e	Hm... I heard that Teoman Topp is in contact with Lord Cuarry's knights. He might be able to help you.zts4239e	Thank you!zts4240e	No problem. I'm sorry I couldn't give you any more help.zts4241e	Hello Teoman! May I ask you something?zts4242e	Yes?zts4243e	I heard that you might know something about a secret meeting between Lord Cuarry and his trusted followers.zts4244e	I don't know anything about that!zts4245e	Really?zts4246e	(It seems like he's telling the truth... What now?)zts4247e	(You hear a voice from somewhere.)zts4248e	Hey! You there!zts4249e	You want to know more about Lord Cuarry's secret meeting place?zts4250e	Do you want me to tell you about it or not?zts4251e	Haha! If you need information, you just have to come to Teodor Topp. I always know what's going on...zts4252e	Sounds good. But I bet I'll have to do something for you too, right?zts4254e	Here you go!zts4255e	Hey, that's not enough!!zts4256e	Not very much... but I guess it will have to do!zts4257e	Phew...zts4258e	I think that's enough now. Hahaha!zts4259e	So, are you going to tell me now?zts4260e	What?zts4261e	Hm, I wonder? WHERE IS THIS SECRET MEETING PLACE???zts4262e	Why?zts4263e	You're asking WHY??? Because I've done everything you've asked me to!zts4264e	Hmmm... and?zts4265e	I gave it a little more thought... and... I can't just tell you. This information is too valuable!zts4266e	Do you want me to bring you something else?zts4267e	I have just changed my mind. *giggle*zts4268e	Maybe I'll tell you about it later. I'll let you know!zts4269e	Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!zts4270e	What?!zts4271e	Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!!!!zts4272e	Shut up already!!zts4273e	Tell me now!! NOW!!zts4274e	(Annoyed.) All right, I'll tell you. But then you have to leave me alone, understand?zts4275e	Hm... I need to find some more clues, but where to begin?zts4276e	Maybe if I talk to Teodor Topp...zts4277e	No, not this guy again!!zts4278e	But who else am I supposed to turn to? I'm afraid I have no other choice.zts4279e	Oh crumbs!! Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?zts4280e	I'm sorry, but I need to ask you a question.zts4281e	You want information? Maybe we should forget our differences and talk to one another. After all, I can acquire any information out there. I'd even talk to a demon if it was worth my while. Hahaha!zts4282e	Oh really?zts4283e	(You explain to Teodor what's been happening.)zts4284e	Oh! Interesting!!!zts4285e	Do you know any more about this?zts4286e	No.zts4287e	Don't hang your head...zts4288e	Maybe I can help you. But you'll need homing perfume.zts4289e	Homing perfume?zts4290e	Talk to Malcolm. He'll be able to tell you more about it.zts4291e	*murmurs* Homing perfume? An extremely useful little resource! You use it to follow someone.zts4292e	Do you have some homing perfume for me?zts4293e	Hmm... let me have a look.zts4294e	(Some time later.)zts4295e	Here you are!zts4296e	But this is just a book!!zts4297e	Yes... I don't have any more homing perfume at the moment. But the recipe for it is in this book. It should be easy enough to make it yourself once you have the ingredients.zts4298e	(Reading.) Well... *murmurs*... Yes, I need that... and that... and then it should be easy.zts4299e	Here you are!zts4300e	Thanks!!!zts4301e	You got the homing perfume? Very good. Well done!zts4302e	What can we use it for?zts4303e	I'll keep the homing perfume. As a small something for me talking to you. Hehe...zts4304e	You are cheating me again??!!zts4305e	Hey, calm down! It was just a little joke. So...zts4306e	I'm listening...zts4307e	You know Tom the knight, right? He drops by at my shop every day.zts4308e	And then?zts4309e	I could secretly spray some of the homing perfume on his sword.zts4310e	Then you'd be able to follow him really easily.zts4311e	But I want to find out why all the knights are acting strange. It's not just about Tom.zts4312e	You airhead!! Okay, okay... I'll tell you more. So Tom...zts4313e	He doesn't get on well with the commanders of the Knights. He's constantly complaining!zts4314e	And?zts4315e	Well... as you know, the knights have all sworn their loyalty. But perhaps he would be the one to let something slip!zts4316e	You just need to get him talking. How you go about that isn't my problem. Good luck!!zts4317e	Understood! Oh, that reminds me...zts4318e	What do else do you want to know?zts4319e	Is this homing perfume really strong enough that I'll be able to follow him?zts4320e	You'll find out soon enough! But I want you to do something for me first. There are these very small creatures that live at the entrance to the northern mine, called Sniffers. Could you go and get me one? Here's a net. You should be able to catch one with that.zts4321e	Tom has just left here. It looks like he's heading to the Sunny Meadows. Hahaha. Well, let's see what this homing perfume can do.zts4322e	Oh no, he disappeared. He managed to get away from me, even with that homing perfume on his sword!zts4323e	Wait!zts4324e	Freeze! Tom doesn't want you following him.zts4325e	You saw him? Where is he?zts4326e	He said he noticed a suspicious smell on his sword.zts4327e	(Damn. He probably knew it was some kind of homing perfume.)zts4328e	You'd better leave him alone. If you get too close to a lone wolf, it'll bite you!zts4329e	I know. But who are you exactly?zts4330e	I'm Head Storeman Jerico.zts4331e	Pleased to meet you.zts4332e	Nice day we're having, don't you think? You should forget about Tom and go hunting for a while.zts4333e	What's this shining on the ground?zts4334e	That's a NosVille guard helmet!zts4335e	Something must have happened here. I'll follow these footmarks.zts4336e	Guard 1: Thanks a million!zts4337e	Guard 2: You saved our lives!zts4338e	You were really lucky!zts4339e	Guard 1: Oh, by the way...zts4340e	Guard 1: While we were imprisoned, a stranger came and visited us...zts4341e	Guard 2: He said that we shouldn't worry. You were going to come and rescue us... Isn't that strange?zts4342e	Who was this stranger?zts4343e	Guard 1: It was too dark to see his face. But he asked me to give you this letter.zts4344e	(The guard gives you a small folded letter.)zts4345e	(I will wait for you to the south. Signed, your enemy.)zts4346e	Guard 1: You look really pale. Is something wrong?zts4347e	Yes unfortunately... I need to get ready for a difficult fight.zts4348e	Guard 1: Oh...zts4349e	Guard 2: There's a famous warrior around here called Jerico!zts4350e	Guard 1: Right! Jerico... People called him Rico Steel Sword!zts4351e	Jerico is Rico Steel Sword?zts4352e	Guard 1: Yes! He used to be the best fighter in NosVille. You should find him. He'll definitely help you!zts4353e	(And I thought he was just some storage assistant...)zts4354e	I know your secret! You're the famous hero, Rico Steel Sword!!zts4355e	I may have been him once - but that was long ago.zts4356e	You can't hide who you are!zts4357e	You're talking about something way in the past. I've already forgotten all about it.zts4358e	Jerico... Please, help me!zts4359e	You're asking me for help?zts4360e	I want to be your student.zts4361e	Hahahahhahaha!!!zts4362e	What's so funny about that??zts4363e	You should leave my past in peace. You'll be better off!zts4364e	Hm... If you ask me with all your heart then perhaps I might change my mind.zts4365e	Uhh, uhh!!! *cough*zts4366e	What's wrong with you?? Did you think you were going to persuade me with a few wooden stakes?zts4367e	I... I have to fight Tom.zts4368e	So you want to die, then?zts4369e	More and more monsters are appearing around NosVille and this conflict with the Kovolts is only going to escalate. We need heroes like Tom!zts4370e	But Tom isn't interested in helping you.zts4371e	Then I'll just have to convince him!zts4372e	So you want to force him to do it?zts4373e	Yes!!!zts4374e	Do you really mean that?zts4375e	Of course!!zts4376e	I didn't expect this from you.zts4377e	I'm intrigued to see whether you can manage to get Tom on your side.zts4378e	And now?zts4379e	To complete your training, you need to complete 3 difficult tests. They will be very demanding!zts4380e	I'm ready!zts4381e	It's really simple.zts4382e	Haha, I mastered all three tests!zts4383e	Congratulations, you did it!!zts4384e	Thank you!zts4385e	We're finished here, off you go!zts4386e	I'm going to convince Tom, that's a promise!zts4387e	I beat Tom in combat! *thinking*zts4388e	Oh nothing. Thank you for your help.zts4389e	Hahaha!! You make me laugh!zts4390e	Hahaha!! Buahahahaha!! You can hardly believe you've hit Tom... Ahahahaha!!!zts4391e	Of course I defeated him. What do you mean, Jerico?zts4392e	Get out of my sight. Come back once you've stopped living in a dream world! Hahahaha!!!zts4393e	Welcome back to NosCamp! We're getting ourselves ready for war!zts4394e	And how's it going?zts4395e	Very well! Lord Cuarry has finally sent us some military aid. But on the other hand we're having to work much harder now!zts4396e	*murmurs* Mimi looks pretty annoyed... Perhaps I should leave her alone for a while...zts4398e	Thank you for your help!zts4399e	I'm very grateful... See you soon!zts4400e	Oh, hello! I'm here because I need some Iron Ore.zts4401e	Is something wrong?zts4402e	Krispo got promoted...zts4403e	Oh... Hehehe...zts4404e	Now, he's my boss...zts4405e	Oh... In that case...zts4406e	I... I'd like to be alone for a bit. See you soon.zts4407e	*murmurs* They aren't going to be of much help. I'll have to go and find some Iron Ore myself.zts4408e	*sniff*... Well done... You can go now.zts4409e	*sigh* That took a long time.zts4410e	I've completed my tasks.zts4411e	Good. I have some news for you.zts4412e	Lord Cuarry has commanded that all adventurers are to take part in the fight against the Kovolts.zts4413e	You don't look particularly happy about this command. Well, it was bound to happen.zts4414e	I'm really sorry about this.zts4415e	Mimi...zts4416e	I'm going to fight!zts4417e	Thank you for everything you've done for me. You're a really lovely person!zts4418e	Yes, but...zts4419e	(You smile.) You don't have to be sorry for me. You can't do anything about it. We just have to be strong now!zts4420e	Really?zts4421e	Cheer up!zts4422e	Okay. Thank you!!zts4423e	*murmurs* Mimi smiled again. So pretty!zts4424e	Knight: The battle begins. Gather together, men!zts4425e	Lord Cuarry's knights are working with the demons. Unbelievable!zts4426e	(You inform Calvin and Mimi that there's a connection between Lord Cuarry's knights and the demons.)zts4427e	What? Is that really true?zts4428e	I'm afraid so! Although I don't know why yet.zts4429e	*sighs* We need to tell the NosVille guards about it right away!zts4430e	Yes, there's no time to waste!zts4431e	The NosVille Guards have set up a camp at Fernon Outpost. Go and meet Commander Ray Ramos there. Hurry!zts4432e	Stop! Who are you?zts4433e	I'm an adventurer from NosCamp. I have urgent news!zts4434e	(You inform Commander Ramos that there's a connection between Lord Cuarry's knights and the demons.)zts4435e	If what you say is true, then we have a big problem. But I need proof!zts4436e	I'm afraid I can't give you...zts4437e	Without proof, your words mean nothing!zts4438e	(There is suddenly an intense commotion in front of the camp.)zts4439e	The Kovolts are attacking! The NosVille guards need to help Lord Cuarry's knights!!zts4440e	Men, get yourselves ready for battle! Do you think you could help us? We can talk more later.zts4441e	Yes, of course.zts4442e	But, commander! They're...zts4443e	Yes, they're an adventurer from NosCamp.zts4444e	These wimpy losers! (He looks at the commander.) The adventurers are cowards and some of them are even on the side of the Kovolts! We can't trust them!zts4445e	What are you talking about?!zts4446e	Now isn't the right time for such accusations. The battle is starting soon.zts4447e	Kovolt Soldier: The Grey Storm is here. That's the end of the humans!zts4448e	We've won! And you were a great help.zts4449e	Yes?zts4450e	You still look very anxious. Is this terrible war weighing on you this much?zts4451e	It's not just that, commander.zts4452e	I see. It's because of this situation with Lord Cuarry's knights that you were telling me about.zts4453e	These illustrious knights are apparently in league with demons? Do you really think we can believe this tale you're spinning, adventurer?zts4454e	Be quiet!zts4455e	But commander!!zts4456e	You've helped us, so I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. We'll keep an eye on the knights! That's all I can do for you at the moment.zts4457e	If you'd like us to do more, you'll need to bring me some proof!zts4458e	Commander!!!zts4459e	Did you understand me?zts4460e	Yes... yes!!zts4461e	(You see the Ramos Knight general's eyes light up with anger.)zts4462e	There you are. I've been waiting for you.zts4463e	This is futile. Without proof, I won't be able to convince Commander Ramos to help us.zts4464e	We need to be careful. If someone accuses us of spreading false rumours, we could be in a lot of trouble.zts4465e	*sigh* What should we do now?zts4466e	Cheer up! Everything isn't lost yet.zts4467e	(Suddenly you can hear a villager crying angrily about 'Kovolts' and 'the Northern Mine'.)zts4468e	Sounds like they're fighting in the Northern Mine!zts4469e	The NosVille guards have screwed up everything!zts4470e	Commander Ray Ramos: ?zts4471e	The knights have suffered many losses, because the guards suddenly retreated like cowards! And all the survivors have disappeared.zts4472e	Don't you have anything to add, commander?zts4473e	Of course! You've forgotten that the NosVille guards don't have to follow Lord Cuarry's orders.zts4474e	They have the right to make their own decisions. And now stop talking about it, it's not good for the soldier's moral.zts4475e	But...zts4476e	Hey, you there, adventurer! Listen!zts4477e	Yes... Yes?zts4478e	Could you go and search for the missing knights? I don't have anyone free at the moment.zts4479e	You can rely on me.zts4480e	There are some tracks here. It's heading that way.zts4481e	There's something underneath these tree trunks.zts4482e	(You discover a note: To all Knights - Go through the mines to the meeting place!)zts4483e	That's where the knights are!zts4484e	If the Kovolts think they can defeat us so easily, they're going to be disappointed! We're safe here!zts4485e	Commander Ramos is already looking for you. You need to go back to the base!zts4486e	That's far too dangerous. It's entirely possible that the Kovolts are going to ambush us somewhere.zts4487e	Hmm...zts4488e	We still have enough provisions to be able to stay here for a while. Don't worry about us. You could do me a favour: take this document to General of the Ramos Knights, understand?zts4489e	It contains important information on our reinforcements. Don't lose it!zts4490e	What do you have there? A document with information about our reinforcements?zts4491e	(The general reads through the document carefully.)zts4492e	*murmurs* His face has taken on a sombre expression.zts4493e	Can you do me a favour?zts4494e	Here, you'll need this.zts4495e	What is that? That looks like powder.zts4496e	Well spotted. It's no normal powder, however - this powder has magical properties. Find a red slate and put some powder on it. You might be able to find one nearby, actually.zts4497e	And what will that do?zts4498e	You'll see for yourself. So get a move on!zts4499e	What's that sound?zts4500e	A guard: The Koaren are attacking!!zts4501e	What is Lord Cuarry doing? Why has he made friends with the demons?zts4502e	I'll take charge here now. So watch what you're saying!zts4503e	Err... Hello! I hope I'm not here at a bad time.zts4504e	You?... Here?zts4505e	Why not? Why is that such a surprise?zts4506e	*murmurs* Looks like the curse on that slate didn't work.zts4507e	Errr... nothing... nothing at all. Anyway, us knights now have total command over all the troops fighting the Kovolts. That includes the adventurers from NosCamp!zts4508e	And I already have the perfect task for you!zts4509e	What is that?zts4510e	Some materials we need in order to keep our swords in good condition haven't arrived yet. See if you can guess what's happened. All of our swords are rusty! How are we going to win a war like this? We need new swords as fast as possible, and you're going to get them for us! 99 of them will be enough.zts4511e	If you dare disobey my command...zts4512e	Yes? And then?zts4513e	Then I'll make sure you're punished according to military law!!zts4514e	*murmurs* This guy seems to really hate me.zts4515e	What are you on about? The knights need new swords?zts4516e	Yes, 99 of them! And quickly!zts4517e	I can't just hand over that many swords to you.zts4518e	But this is really important! Please!zts4519e	Do you have Lord Cuarry's knight seal with you? No? Then I can't do anything else for you.zts4520e	Oh, come on. Please!zts4521e	Are you deaf? I said no!zts4522e	(The voice of the general of the Ramos knights reverberates in your head.)zts4523e	'I'll make sure you're punished according to military law!'zts4524e	You look like you need these swords quickly!zts4525e	Can't you help me?zts4526e	You heard what he said. No seal, no swords!zts4527e	*sigh*zts4531e	I did what you asked. Now please tell me how I can get the seal.zts4533e	HELLO?zts4534e	What?zts4535e	How do I get the seal??zts4536e	Oh right, the seal.zts4537e	Yes, I'm listening...zts4538e	Go to the Mine Plains. You'll meet someone there who will be able to help you.zts4539e	That's all?zts4541e	Greetings, adventurer. Teodor already let me know you'd be dropping by.zts4542e	Who are you?zts4543e	That's not important. I've got a little task for you: go and get me the Fire Slade's Glowing Heart from the closed mine!zts4544e	What? What do you want me to do?zts4545e	(Silence.)zts4546e	(The mysterious figure has disappeared.)zts4547e	I should take this heart to my mysterious client.zts4548e	Well done! This should make it easy to break into Lord Cuarry's house.zts4549e	What do you mean? Are you going to steal the seal from him?zts4550e	Don't worry about it. You'll just have to be patient for a while. Once I have the seal, I'll take it to Teodor Topp.zts4551e	(Silence again.)zts4552e	It's disappeared.zts4553e	Throw the adventurer in prison!zts4554e	What? Why??zts4555e	You don't have the 99 swords with you, or am I mistaken?zts4556e	Not yet, no, but I'll be able to get them soon.zts4557e	Arrest him! Now!zts4558e	Stop, no! Please give me some more time.zts4559e	(The sounds of fighting erupt from in front of the camp.)zts4560e	Alarm!! The Koaren are attacking again!zts4561e	Looks like you've lucked out again, adventurer. Go, help us fight the Kovolts!zts4562e	Have the Kenkos joined the uprising as well?zts4563e	No! I told you I'd bring you the swords!zts4564e	You should give them a bit more time!zts4565e	Why are you meddling with my business? I've made my decision. The adventurer can rot in prison!zts4566e	Give them another chance!zts4567e	We need those swords. And you don't want Lord Cuarry to hear about this, do you? That wouldn't be very good for your career...zts4568e	Don't you dare tell him about this!zts4569e	Let's not let it come to that. Give the adventurer a little more time!zts4570e	Thanks, commander!!zts4571e	Bah! I really don't know why you're helping them.zts4572e	I think everyone deserves a second chance!zts4573e	Big words! Are you proud of yourself? Ah, what's the point. Then they can try their luck again.zts4574e	Thanks.zts4575e	Hey adventurer! I'll give you one more day!!zts4576e	?zts4577e	What are you waiting for? Go already!zts4578e	One day you'll regret treating me so badly!zts4579e	Hahaha!!zts4580e	Ah, it's you! Here are your 99 swords!zts4581e	Fantastic! Thank you!zts4582e	I have just made sure that Lord Cuarry gets the seal back.zts4583e	Haha... Hahaha...zts4584e	There's something else...zts4585e	Apparently demons are hanging about on Lord Cuarry's premises!zts4586e	There's another rumour going round that the Kenkos have made a pact with the demons.zts4587e	Huh?! But that's ridiculous!zts4588e	As you say... I'm just telling you what I've heard. Hahaha!zts4589e	Put him behind bars!zts4590e	What's this about? But I have the swords here!zts4591e	I knew we could rely on you.zts4592e	You did it! Unbelievable...zts4593e	Thank you for standing up for me, commander. I would like to tell you something in private.zts4594e	(You tell Commander Ramos the news about the demons.)zts4595e	I need to tell my brave soldiers about this. Each day they are facing the music in the fight against the Kovolts.zts4596e	How will they react?zts4597e	I don't know. And I also cannot understand why Lord Cuarry would get involved with something like that. Perhaps we should lay down our weapons for a while and see how things develop.zts4598e	I just hope that everything turns out all right in the end.zts4599e	Hey, General!zts4600e	Ha... haha... hahaha!!zts4601e	*mumbles* Has he gone completely mad?zts4602e	(You explain what you've heard about the demons to the Captain of the Ramos Knights.)zts4603e	What does it mean?zts4604e	I don't know yet either. But you can trust me. I'm not lying to you.zts4605e	So what should we do now, do you think?zts4606e	I think it is time to stop this senseless fighting.zts4607e	Hahaha! It's not that easy. We're knights! Fighting is our life.zts4608e	Listen, men: We're going to attack them by surprise in a moment. Get ready!zts4609e	Captain!!zts4610e	You'll be our scouts, adventurers. We want to attack the enemy's side from a corridor. And you're going to scout out the corridor!zts4611e	No buts! Lord Cuarry has decreed, that the knights have the power to give orders to the NosVille guards. Or did you forget that again already?zts4612e	All right, I understand...zts4613e	Let's return to the military base.zts4614e	The demons didn't flatten all the Kenkos? Damn it! Damn it!!!zts4615e	Calm down!zts4616e	These demons are going to pay for this! (He's blustering with anger.)zts4617e	Please, calm down!zts4618e	You again! Get out of my sight or you'll be making friends with my blade!zts4619e	Hello! We've got a big problem!zts4620e	What?zts4621e	Lord Cuarry has threatened to banish the adventurers from NosCamp!zts4622e	What?!zts4623e	Lord Cuarry's seal was stolen and he thinks that one of the adventurers in NosCamp is the thief.zts4624e	Oh no, you've got to be joking! I need to go and talk to Teodor, quick!!zts4625e	Hahaha!! Long time no see!zts4626e	Hey! I thought you said you were going to send the seal back to Lord Cuarry!zts4627e	I sent someone to do that for me. But if you're this annoyed, then I'm guessing the seal hasn't made its way back to Lord Cuarry. What a shame!zts4628e	I can't believe this! What are we going to do, now??zts4629e	How should I know? All I did was act on your behalf.zts4630e	What? You asked me to get the seal... But there's no point blaming each other now. We have to find a solution.zts4631e	Hahaha! Well better start thinking!zts4632e	Come on! You'll be able to help me.zts4634e	This is my offer. Take it or leave it.zts4635e	Very good. Sir Crescendo will certainly be pleased by the Gold.zts4636e	Who is this Sir Crescendo?zts4637e	He's Lord Cuarry's right hand and a man who is not averse to a good bribe. No wonder we get on so well. Haha!zts4638e	*murmurs* This could work...zts4641e	Those are the provisions for the broker!zts4642e	Of course! He doesn't want to live like a dog, after all.zts4643e	That's quite a lot. Who is this broker?zts4644e	Me of course! What did you think?zts4645e	Anyway, 30,000 pieces of gold aren't enough for Sir Crescendo. We'll need something else we can bargain with!zts4646e	Have you ever heard of the Blood-Red Ruby?zts4647e	What is that?zts4648e	This is a very special gemstone of unparalleled beauty. I'm sure this will persuade Sir Crescendo to help us.zts4649e	A gemstone, you say? Then I should talk to Soraya. No one knows more about jewellery than she does.zts4650e	You're looking for the Blood-Red Ruby? That's the king of gemstones!zts4651e	Where can I find him?zts4652e	You won't be able to find the Blood-Red Ruby so easily. It has to be created by a gemstone expert. I could do that for you, however I'll need some small rubies. Of course, there's a small problem...zts4653e	The small red rubies needed to create it are very rare. They can only be found from certain leeches.zts4654e	Leeches?zts4655e	Yes, a specific kind of leech. I'll tell you where you can find these strange creatures.zts4656e	Thank you for your help.zts4657e	It could be a good thing for you to go looking for rubies for a while. Don't lose your patience straight away!zts4658e	Did it go well? Very good!zts4659e	(Soraya disappears into the Fashion Boutique with the small rubies. Some time later she comes out with a magnificent gemstone in her hand.)zts4660e	Here: the Blood-Red Ruby Isn't it wonderful?zts4661e	Hahaha! Now everything is ready! Trust me!zts4662e	Are you sure if everything is perfectly ready?zts4663e	You don't know me? Don't worry!zts4664e	*murmurs* I know you too well. That's the problem...zts4665e	Good news!! Thanks to Sir Crescendo's generosity NosCamp is no longer being punished.zts4666e	Hahaha... I'm so happy.zts4667e	But only on one condition.zts4668e	Condition?zts4669e	You have to gather information about the Kenkos in Kreano.zts4670e	Hmmm... Do you have an idea?zts4671e	Hmmm... Rumour has it that the demons have made a compromise with the Kenkos for some reason...zts4672e	Huh?! What do you mean? But the demons are with Lord Cuarry...zts4673e	I don't know.zts4674e	(You tell Mimi what has happened so far.)zts4675e	So it's true! I have to keep Lord Cuarry and everyone in NosCamp in the loop.zts4676e	And then, I'll tell the knights and NosVille Guards!zts4677e	If the Demons want to sell the area around NosVille to the Kenkos, we'll need to break the alliance between the Demons and Lord Cuarry.zts4678e	Yes. We have to.zts4679e	(You tell Commander Ray Ramos and the General of the Ramos Knights what has happened so far.)zts4680e	*sigh* It's exactly as we feared...zts4681e	These filthy demons! They've deceived us! Damn demons!zts4682e	Calm down. Koaren lost the Kenkos and we've lost the demons. Perhaps this is the time to finish this war.zts4683e	Maybe...zts4684e	We will handle the alliance with the demons later. Right now we need to attend to the Koaren. This is more important right now. General of the Ramos Knights, give the orders.zts4685e	Indeed!zts4686e	We must finish this war at all costs! I'll be at the front, helping put an end to all this!zts4687e	That's enough! Into the fray, General of the Ramos Knights!zts4688e	Indeed!zts4689e	The enemy is retreating!zts4690e	Over here!zts4691e	Err? Where have they gotten to?zts4692e	Now I know how Korrkoaren and Kenel disappeared. *sigh* We'll see them again soon.zts4693e	Kenkos... What are they thinking? Maybe if we look around we will find some clues.zts4694e	What... is that? There is a mysterious power coming from this...zts4695e	Maybe Malcolm knows more about this.zts4696e	Hmm... That's...zts4697e	Do you know what this is?zts4698e	Oh... I'm sorry, but I don't know... However, it doesn't seem particularly valuable...zts4699e	Oh really?zts4700e	Hm... This is...zts4701e	Anything in particular?zts4702e	I don't know...zts4703e	Argh!zts4704e	However...zts4705e	There's a message on it...zts4706e	So? What is it?zts4707e	Closed Mine 1... A Kovolt Statue... Touch a Hellhound Necklace... A door will open...zts4708e	Anyway... What do you mean?zts4709e	No idea... Hehehe.zts4710e	Somehow strange...zts4711e	Oh... here... there's a name...zts4712e	What name?zts4713e	Kenko... Hm... A strange name... *thinking*zts4714e	Do you know him?zts4715e	Do you know where I could get a Hellhound Necklace from?zts4716e	A Hellhound Necklace... From the neck of a Hellhound of course... Hm...zts4717e	So where do I have to go?zts4718e	Where the Hellhound lives...zts4719e	Hm... I've got a bad feeling about this place...zts4720e	Oh, that... is...zts4721e	Are you an intruder?zts4722e	Haha! Humans aren't allowed to come here. Haha...zts4723e	Come on!!zts4724e	No... Please... wait!!!zts4725e	There's always time to be a bit flexible, even in the world of demons...zts4726e	What... what do you mean?zts4727e	Well I'm sure I could be persuaded to keep quiet... for a little something in return.zts4728e	Haha! Hahaha...zts4729e	I like peace... Hahaha...zts4730e	Hm... This isn't a usual conversation for a demon.zts4731e	Well... The demon world isn't that different to the others. Corruption and decay are everywhere.zts4732e	Alright then. What do you want?zts4733e	Some Mole Whiskers.zts4734e	What? What do you need those for?zts4735e	This is the most popular fashion accessory in the demon world these days.zts4736e	Hm... Okay...zts4737e	Very well, then I will consider the deal made... I hope you will be quick. I can't keep silent forever.zts4738e	Haha... Excellent work!zts4739e	Just a moment.zts4740e	I'm here for a Kenko. I chased them here. Where are they now?zts4741e	Not here.zts4742e	He left a long time ago... He said he came here to get an antidote.zts4743e	Hm... I'm a bit late then.zts4744e	But if you want, I can tell you where he is.zts4745e	You know where he is?zts4746e	Of course! Haha!zts4747e	Can you tell me right now?zts4748e	Certainly. But unfortunately my hands are rather empty. Haha!zts4749e	*murmurs* Reminds me of someone in NosVille...zts4750e	Kenel.zts4751e	Yes, Master.zts4752e	Gather our soldiers and form them into ranks. War is upon us! A war in which we'll punish our brothers.zts4753e	Yes, Master!zts4754e	And humans.zts4755e	We must end this conflict between us.zts4756e	End the conflict...zts4757e	Cease fire!zts4758e	Argh! It breaks my heart! Brother! Brother!!zts4759e	Get Questzts4760e	End Dialoguezts4761e	Gamblingzts4762e	Life is a game. Do you want to test your luck?zts4763e	Job Changezts4764e	Familieszts4765e	Get Questzts4766e	Learn Skillzts4771e	Individual Arenazts4772e	Family Arenazts4773e	Time Circlezts4774e	Teleportzts4775e	Set Respawn Pointzts4776e	(???)zts4777e	For laboratory usezts4778e	Hmmm... that's...zts4779e	Hmmm... that's great... don't you think?zts4780e	Whatever... I think that could be extremely interesting.zts4781e	Goddess Zenas! Have you never heard of her? We are talking about the fact that we can summon the shadow of the goddess Zenas. The same shadow that destroyed the secret laboratory!zts4782e	Anyway, just one moment... ah, there it is...zts4783e	That is the Shadow of Zenas Seal. You may now be able to meet the Shadow of Zenas.zts4784e	If the research data you gave me is correct, they yes... but I can't guarantee it.zts4785e	Oh! You just have a stick of wood as a weapon?zts4786e	Congratulations! Your family has a new member: a loyal and happy Wooly.zts4787e	This looks like the place where it all came from. I'm sure something is going to happen here soon...zts4788e	Hey! What are you doing here?zts4789e	Oh, nothing special.zts4790e	Hm. Well then, you can do me a favour.zts4791e	I brought my weapon to the tool shop to be repaired. Can you collect it for me?zts4792e	Of course, I'll do that!zts4793e	Haha, well spotted! As a matter of fact, there are a few things you could do for me.zts4794e	Good news! Koaren's troops retreated to Mt. Krem! The war is over!zts4795e	Phew... It's really over?zts4796e	Hm... You don't look very happy about it. What's the matter?zts4797e	Well... I just can't believe it's all over... Hahaha...zts4798e	Haha... You're probably just tired. Even in times of peace there's lots to do in NosCamp!zts4799e	You're going to give me another task, aren't you? Tell me.zts4800e	Malcolm asked you to collect some magical supplies. He looks busy, so be quick about it. Eva was also asking for some cooking things, so help her too.zts4801e	Here you are.zts4802e	Magical ingredients... You wanted these, right?zts4803e	Oh... Really?zts4804e	Yes, really.zts4805e	Aha! I've been waiting for it!zts4806e	Haha.zts4807e	Thanks to the people at NosCamp!zts4808e	Haha. Yes.zts4809e	By the way, how's the treasure hunt going?zts4810e	Treasure hunt?zts4811e	I heard that the people of NosCamp are all trying to find treasure at the moment... Is that right?zts4812e	Hm... I'll ask Mimi about it.zts4813e	Arghh!! You've been expelled!zts4814e	Haha... Not really... Presumably...zts4815e	Oh no! Someone's been exiled from NosCamp!zts4816e	No, calm down! It's not possible.zts4817e	You've probably forgotten! Go to Mimi and ask!zts4818e	*murmurs* Eva looks... happy!zts4819e	Hey, Mimi! Mimi!zts4820e	Yes?zts4821e	Eva told me about a treasure hunt... What is it?zts4822e	Oh... This is...zts4823e	Tell me!zts4824e	Hm... Well... We received a report from someone about hidden treasure.zts4825e	And why didn't you tell me about it?zts4826e	Hm... Because the information... comes from Slugg...zts4827e	Haha... As you know, he only trusts some people.zts4828e	Yes, that's true...zts4829e	If you're really that interested, go and find him yourself and ask him about it. However...zts4830e	Yes, I know... NosCamp won't be able to give me any help... That's what you wanted to say, right?zts4831e	Exactly!!zts4832e	Can you tell me something about this hidden treasure?zts4833e	Hidden treasure?zts4834e	Mimi Mentor told me about it. What the heck is that?zts4835e	Hehe... you idiot. There's nothing to talk about!zts4836e	What do you mean? Why not?zts4837e	Treasure of darkness... do you want it? Then you'll know about the four virtues?zts4838e	Virtues?zts4839e	The first one is empathy! You have to understand other people's feelings so that you can keep from harming them.zts4840e	The second virtue is sacrifice! You must sacrifice your comfort for that of another.zts4841e	Hmmmm?zts4842e	The third virtue is dedication! That doesn't just apply to emotions, but to how you act. You have to serve others.zts4843e	*murmurs* Hmm... It all sounds so hard.zts4844e	The final one is sharing. You must share everything you have with others.zts4845e	Hmm... maybe you're just telling me this because you want to ask me something specific?zts4846e	*cough*zts4847e	You mean, once I've done something for you, you'll tell me something about the treasure? Is that right?zts4850e	You'll strike it rich to the north west of Sunny Meadows - at the end of a cave. The Super Tool set is hidden there...zts4851e	Super Tool set?zts4852e	It has four parts, that I need.zts4853e	Okay, I'll bring them to you. And then you'll tell me more about this hidden treasure? Right?zts4854e	Hmm... Hmm...zts4855e	*murmurs* Yes... It's Slugg... what else do I expect.zts4856e	Slugg : Ohhh!!!zts4857e	Here you are.zts4858e	Ohhhhh!!!zts4859e	Now tell me about the treasure, as you promised!zts4860e	Alright, I'll keep my promise. I'll mark the location of the treasure for you.zts4861e	What... what is that?!zts4862e	No idea...zts4863e	Get it away from here!!zts4864e	I'm sorry...zts4865e	(Slugg is ashamed.)zts4866e	Hahaha... So this carved sculpture is Slugg's treasure.zts4867e	Yes, that's right.zts4868e	This piece looks interesting. Can I have a look?zts4869e	Here you go.zts4870e	Hmm... That's...zts4871e	Anything in particular?zts4872e	This is..a magic stone. The Kovolts in Kreano use this.zts4873e	Kovolts in Kreano? Do you mean the Kenkos?zts4874e	Yes, that's right. Hm... It looks like this stone was used recently. That means the Kenkos are still around in NosVille somewhere.zts4875e	So the Kenkos... haven't retreated to Kreano?zts4876e	There are some rumours about a war between the Koaren and the Kenkos. We need to find out what's going on. It could have an impact on NosVille and make a lot of problems for us.zts4877e	I was afraid of that...zts4878e	You don't seem surprised by this.zts4879e	Yes... Hm... I'll meet with the Koaren again I think.zts4880e	Hmm... I heard from other adventurers that you can meet Koaren spies in Fernon Temple. You had better go there.zts4881e	Who's there?!zts4882e	Ah... Calm down. I'm just...zts4883e	If you're not going to fight, then you'd better get out of my way!zts4884e	Wait! I'm really worried about Korrkoaren...zts4885e	Haha! You dare speak the name of my Master? Go away! I don't want to hear about it!zts4886e	Just a moment. I know that you are against Kenko now. I am just trying to...zts4887e	Hey! My companion was taken by the Kenkos and I don't know if they're alive or not... Do you really think I want to listen to you? Get out of my sight!zts4888e	*murmurs* I think I'll save my breath... Didn't he just say that he lost his companion?zts4889e	Why are you helping us?zts4890e	That's strange.zts4891e	I.. I don't want to be your enemy!zts4892e	I... just want to help you.zts4893e	*sigh* My Master and Kenel have both ordered me not to hurt you.zts4894e	Well... Do whatever you want.zts4895e	Tha... Thanks.zts4896e	You want to help us? If so, there's one place that we need to check out... Would you do that for us?zts4897e	Definitely!!zts4898e	Some of our companions went there and we haven't heard from them since... Please help us.zts4899e	We... couldn't recognise anything but the Koaren companions.zts4900e	Hm... I see. Sounds good.zts4901e	However... I was attacked suddenly... I very nearly had a very serious problem.zts4902e	Hey! You must understand that. We Kovolts hate humans... And as you know, the war has only just ended.zts4903e	Yes... I see.zts4904e	While you were away, I learned something interesting... Kenko's supply troops have arrived near Fernon Temple.zts4905e	I'm wondering in what way the troops supported the Kenkos. We'll have to find out.zts4906e	I will check it out!!zts4907e	Hm... You don't have to do this. It's very dangerous... And it's our problem, not yours.zts4908e	The Koaren and the Kenkos are already enemies. So it's safer for humans to get close than it is for Koaren.zts4909e	Haha! You are so stubborn!!zts4910e	Only because I know I can do it!!zts4911e	Are you serious?zts4912e	Yes, of course!!zts4913e	I'm sorry. Someone needs to do something... And we can't do it...zts4914e	You don't have to be sorry! Just let me do it!zts4915e	Okay then... They drink strange beverages... It will be good if we could have a few of them.zts4916e	Fantastic... Excellent work!zts4917e	Haha... Thank you for saying so!zts4918e	I will analyse this drink and tell you what I come up with. Oh, by the way...zts4919e	The Kenkos have apparently received some emergency rations... Could you get us some of those as well?zts4920e	Just leave to me!!zts4921e	You are so quick...zts4922e	Haha! I did say you could leave it to me. Oh, did you get the results back from that beverage?zts4923e	Hm... it seems to contain a hallucinogenic ingredient. But I can't really say anything more specific than that...zts4924e	This ingredient is certainly effective, but the effect on our bodies is very weak...zts4925e	That sounds complicated.zts4926e	Well... Once we've inspected these dog bones, it should all be clear.zts4927e	And the black powder they're using on the guards... that sounds very suspicious.zts4928e	Why?zts4929e	The rumour is that the powder can heal all your problems instantly - regardless of the injury.zts4930e	I'll get some of it!zts4931e	I'm really sorry for giving you such dangerous tasks.zts4932e	This is the medicine.zts4933e	If you mix this dog bone with the beverage, a harmful substance is created.zts4934e	What? What do you mean?zts4935e	It drives people half insane, and turns them into belligerent monsters.zts4936e	Oh... I see.zts4937e	This powder might have the same effect.zts4938e	Just a little patience, okay? I've almost finished analysing this powder!!zts4939e	(The spy disappears with the powder and then reappears a few minutes later.)zts4940e	This is a really big problem!!!zts4941e	Whoever takes this becomes a monster with super powers.zts4942e	And then they die shortly afterwards!zts4943e	Really scary, isn't it?zts4944e	The worst thing is that Kliff's troops are hunting the fleeing Kenko troops, which include many injured people.zts4945e	Kliff's in danger!! Okay what do we have to do?zts4946e	Wait a moment!!zts4947e	I want us to go together...zts4948e	That's just not possible!zts4949e	Why not?!zts4950e	We are heading to a place where humans are hated... You can't go there!zts4951e	And?zts4952e	We're not humans so our presence will be tolerated. But you are a human, so you would be in danger - it's not going to work. I'm sorry. Bye!zts4953e	(Kliff has disappeared.)zts4954e	Is there any way I can help? Maybe Malcolm has an idea...zts4955e	Hey, Malcolm!!zts4956e	Malcolm!!!zts4957e	Hmmm...zts4958e	Malcolm!! Listen to me!zts4959e	Ahhh... Oh! Excuse me...zts4960e	It's an emergency. Do you know a place where humans are forbidden to go?zts4961e	Ah... Yes, I know a place. But I don't know why it's like that... Apparently there are ghosts there that hate humans and don't allow them in... Unless...zts4962e	Unless?zts4963e	Oh, well... If you're not a human anymore, you'll be able to enter.zts4964e	But that's ridiculous!zts4965e	Oh... Yes, you're right!zts4966e	Is it really impossible?zts4967e	Ahhh...zts4968e	Please!zts4969e	Oh... Well... I can... I can make you look like Kovolt...zts4970e	Slugg Main Questzts4971e	Level 19 - A New Friendzts4972e	Mimi Main Questzts4973e	Level 25 - A Formidable Enemyzts4974e	Level 31 - The Grey Stormzts4975e	Teodor Main Questzts4976e	Level 28 - Rivalryzts4977e	Commander Ray Ramos Main Questzts4978e	Level 33 - Whirl of Warzts4979e	Level 39 - Trust and Betrayalzts4980e	General of the Ramos Knights Main Questzts4981e	Level 35 - Friend and Foezts4982e	If you have 10,000 Gold for me, then I can help you to retrieve the seal...zts4983e	What? 10,000 Gold?zts4984e	Hahahaha! 10,000 Gold!! (Teodor Topp's eyes gleam hungrily.)zts4985e	Hahahaha! 10,000 Gold!! (Teodor Topp's eyes gleam hungrily.)zts4986e	Hahaha! 10,000 pieces of gold!! A pleasure doing business with you. Hahaha!!zts4987e	Yeah, I guess. That only costs a pittance. That'll be 50,000 pieces of gold you owe me.zts4988e	Right, so we have 30,000 Gold for Sir Crescendo. That leaves...zts4989e	30,000?? And what about the remaining 20,000?zts4990e	Hm... Really?zts4991e	Hm... We can use this Suction Funnel to suck up the Kovolts' energy... Hm...zts4992e	How?zts4993e	Once we've tired the Kovolts out... we can use the Suction Funnel...zts4994e	And then?zts4995e	The Suction Funnel... will then be... filled with the Kovolts' energy... Hmm... *thinking*zts4996e	Tell me in more detail!zts4997e	Hm... I'll explain all of it to you once we have the Kovolts' energy.zts4998e	Phew... That's that.zts4999e	Voice: Erm... Hello?zts5000e	That's... Malcolm?zts5001e	Voice: Haha... Yes... It's me.zts5002e	What are you doing here? It's far too dangerous.zts5003e	Voice: Oh... Well... I invented something... Something new...zts5004e	Voice: A gadget... that can send voices... over long distances...zts5005e	You mean a gadget that allows people to communicate over long distances?zts5006e	Voice: Yes... that's right... That's it...zts5007e	Oh, that's... amazing. By the way! I used the funnel and got the Kenko Bead. I'm going back now.zts5008e	Voice: Oh... But... Do you know the deserted Wizard Tower?zts5009e	What are you talking about?zts5010e	Voice: Oh, excuse me... It occurs to me... What was it again... Some scroll or other...zts5011e	Voice: We need that scroll... Erm... Oh... Oh no...zts5012e	(Strange noises.)zts5013e	(Malcolm's connection has disconnected.)zts5014e	His new invention must be broken... Hm... Didn't he say something about the Wizard Tower?zts5015e	Malcolm!! I have it.zts5016e	*mumble*zts5017e	Malcolm!!zts5018e	Oh... Oh, sorry! The gadget is broken now... so...zts5019e	*murmurs* It will need to be fixed.zts5020e	Oh... What brings you to me?zts5021e	I've brought what you asked for.zts5022e	Oh... And what is it?zts5023e	Oh, sorry... That's right. That... erm... should be enough. Just a moment.zts5024e	(Some time later.)zts5025e	Erm... that...zts5026e	Do I look like a Kovolt.... in this?zts5027e	Erm... I think so...zts5028e	*murmurs* I should just ignore him...zts5029e	Is that you, human?zts5030e	Well... War is upon us! The Kenkos... They'll pay for their treachery!zts5031e	But... How did this betrayal happen?zts5032e	Haha! I don't know. I'll find out somehow. But first we need to think about this war.zts5033e	I see...zts5034e	Our units will attack the main Kenko army. You stay here and block their retreat!zts5035e	Will do!zts5036e	Once the retreat is blocked, dispatch our spies. They will give support to our troops in the rear.zts5037e	I'll take care of it. Don't worry.zts5038e	Thanks, human. Take care!zts5039e	(You explain what has happened so far.)zts5040e	Okay. We need to act right away. Did our units head off for the main Kenko army already?zts5041e	I think so...zts5042e	I have some critical information. I know where the Kenkos are right now. What if we hit them before the war begins?zts5043e	Could we finish the war quickly?zts5044e	Yes. Of course....zts5045e	I'll go. Just tell me where.zts5046e	The other Kovolts need to be informed immediately... No time for that! Hurry!zts5047e	Kenel has been captured? Oh, no...zts5048e	What should we do now?zts5049e	I have no idea... Damn it!zts5050e	I'm sorry... It's no use being angry with yourself.zts5051e	Look at this... This is the document I found in the Kenkos' camp.zts5052e	Hm... This is written in an ancient language of Kreano. Maybe Kliff knows how to read it.zts5053e	Where is Kliff?zts5054e	Around here somewhere. If I meet Kliff before you do, I will tell him.zts5055e	Yes, please!zts5056e	Hurry up and find Kliff!zts5057e	Now where do we have to go?zts5058e	To the East... Must be somewhere there. It's called the Spiral Maze...zts5059e	Spiral Maze?zts5060e	I don't know anything else either. This place is hidden behind a veil. The only thing I know is that it's very dangerous.zts5061e	Hm... Then I'll have to make sure I'm ready.zts5062e	That is... strange... I can't go any further! There's a strange magical power stopping me... Maybe Malcolm knows more about this...zts5063e	(You explain what has happened so far.)zts5064e	Ah!! I'm sorry... Do you know the holy-red branch?zts5065e	Holy-red branch? What does that have to do with it?zts5066e	The holy-red branch... With help from the holy altar, you can make a Branch of Innocence...zts5067e	A Branch of Innocence?zts5068e	The holy altar... Hm... It must be in Wizard Tower 8... I think... *murmurs*zts5069e	Erm... Hello?zts5070e	Does that mean if I have the Branch of Innocence, I can pass the corridor?zts5071e	*murmurs* Hm... That should be right...zts5072e	Then I'll head off to the Wizard Tower!zts5073e	Phew, finished! The Branch of Innocence!zts5074e	There are 4 energy streams. But these streams are protected by a special magical power.zts5075e	And how do I neutralise that power?zts5076e	Hmm... You'll probably have to use a magical item on each of them... We should look around more closely. Maybe we'll find a path.zts5077e	All four streams have been neutralised!zts5078e	Quickly! You have to complete it before Fernon regains her power!zts5079e	Voice: Stop it!!zts5080e	Who's talking?zts5081e	Voice: Do you wish to take on Fernon?zts5082e	Who are you?zts5083e	Voice: Fernon's frenzy will burn you to ashes!zts5084e	Tell me who you are! What do you want from me?zts5085e	Voice: I'd like to make a deal with you. I will wait for you on the top of the temple.zts5086e	(Silence returns.)zts5087e	That voice... Can we trust it?zts5088e	Just look! Over there...zts5089e	It's surrounded by a very powerful magical aura. And then this voice... We can't just ignore it.zts5090e	I don't know who you are... What do you want? Why did you call us?zts5091e	Kill me!!!zts5092e	Watch yourself! It has enormous magic power!!zts5093e	Haha... Now I'm free.zts5094e	I don't know... Ever since I was captured here, time seems to've stood still... Who I am... How I came to this place... All of that... I don't remember it...zts5095e	What are you talking about?! We have to defeat Fernon! We must defeat her!zts5096e	Hah! Fernon cannot be defeated.zts5097e	Maybe... I'm the key... to Fernon's slumber... someone... must have woken... Fernon...zts5098e	That's right.zts5099e	Thank you very much. Then I am free... I will no leave... this place...zts5100e	(The soul is slowly disappearing.)zts5101e	Hey! We have to defeat Fernon! But how? How can we reach Fernon's trunk?zts5102e	Only the person who awakens Fernon can approach her trunk... you'll need a magical item from the person who woke her... otherwise you will only be playing with death. Give up...zts5103e	Hey! Hey!!!zts5104e	(The soul has disappeared.)zts5105e	Oh no!!!zts5106e	It is the Kenko who awoke Fernon...!zts5107e	What are you talking about?!zts5108e	If we have a personal item of his, then we can go through this magical field.zts5109e	But... how will we manage that?zts5110e	Yes, that might be a problem...zts5111e	Hm... Do you have any idea where one of these magical items would be?zts5112e	We need to get to NosVille, quick! Quick! Hurry!zts5113e	No time for that! Quick!zts5114e	Calvin!! Calvin!!zts5115e	Oh, what's the rush?zts5116e	That magic stone... The one I gave you!zts5117e	That... magic stone from Kreano... That looks so strange...zts5118e	Ah that... Here it is.zts5119e	I don't know what you plan on doing with it... But I'm glad I could help you.zts5120e	Yes, that's it! This should work!zts5121e	It's... over.zts5122e	No, it's not over yet. We just need to keep moving!zts5123e	So do we have another chance?zts5124e	Hmm... this magic field looks completely broken... we should be able to push forward straight to Fernon's heart.zts5125e	Fernon's heart?zts5126e	That's right. When Fernon's heart stops beating... that should be the end of the trunk.zts5127e	You're right. We should focus on the heart.zts5128e	Trust me! We can still do this! It's too soon to surrender!zts5129e	We will not run! We will not quit! Follow me, my brothers! Raise your swords and attack!zts5130e	The Black Slate! The monsters use it to communicate!zts5131e	Why exactly are you telling me this?zts5135e	Hmm? It's called the Stone Cliff.zts5136e	Stone Cliff?zts5137e	It's dangerous! Why did you follow me?zts5138e	What's so dangerous?zts5139e	Don't go any further! There are terrible monsters up ahead!zts5140e	Monsters?zts5141e	They attack all living creatures that aren't Kovolts. The demon brought them here.zts5142e	Stop, don't go any further. See you later!zts5143e	NosVille Trainingzts5151e	Get the Chicken King Seal.zts5152e	We will tell everyone in NosVille.zts5153e	The Lord Cuarry's Chicken Farm is in danger because of the furious hens and roosters.zts5154e	The Chicken King always used to be very popular. But now he's become insane and aggressive, and nobody knows why.zts5155e	If we can't do anything about it, we won't have any fresh eggs from now on.zts5156e	If you don't want that to happen, you'd better catch the Chicken King right away.zts5157e	There's no time to lose. Hurry! Did you understand me?zts5158e	[Benito, Lord Cuarry's butler]zts5159e	Hmm... that... sounds like a threat!zts5160e	Level 43 - Searching for Mysterious Treasureszts5161e	Koaren Spy Main Questzts5162e	Level 45 - New Alliancezts5163e	Level 48 - The Tree of Fernonzts5164e	Koaren Spy Conversationzts5165e	Official Eventzts5166e	Mimi 1zts5167e	Mimi 2zts5168e	Mimi 3zts5169e	Mimi 4zts5170e	Mimi 5zts5171e	Mimi 6zts5172e	Mimi 7zts5173e	Accept Itemzts5174e	Level 44 - New Alliancezts5175e	Yobby Expy Miner's Jajamaru Questzts5176e	Accept Questzts5177e	Jajamaru Questzts5178e	Oh, hello!zts5179e	I'm busy! Go away!zts5180e	(He doesn't look great.)zts5181e	*sniff* How can we break this thing?zts5182e	Hm?zts5183e	Are you still here? Why are you bothering me?!zts5184e	I don't mean to disturb you. (I will ask him my question later.) You seem to be having difficulties. I wanted to offer you my assistance.zts5185e	Oh, really? Please excuse me, but I'm afraid you won't be able to manage that alone.zts5186e	I think it's a meteorite... I discovered it recently, but it is so hard that I cannot destroy it with my pickaxe!zts5187e	Oh, a meteorite? How is that possible? Where is this meteorite?zts5188e	See that hole over there? There's where it is. I can't carry on as it's blocking my path.zts5189e	If only I could smash it to bits... (I need something harder.) Just a moment! I have an idea.zts5190e	Could you do me a favour?zts5191e	Depends what it is...zts5192e	I need smash a meteorite to pieces, but a pickaxe won't do the job.zts5193e	Perhaps a big hammer would do the trick. Bring me the materials and I'll make one for you.zts5194e	Thank you. What materials do you need for that?zts5195e	I need high-quality metal and high-quality wood.zts5196e	Here are the materials you asked for.zts5197e	Ah! That should be plenty. Just a moment, please.zts5198e	A short time later...zts5199e	Okay... I'm done.zts5200e	That's great! I think I could smash anything to bits with this.zts5201e	Haha! I put in extra effort with this. After all, you're using it to help someone!zts5202e	Thank you very much. See you soon!zts5203e	Do you think we can use this to smash the meteorite to pieces?zts5204e	Oh! I'm sure this hammer will do the trick. Thank you!zts5205e	Don't mention it. I'll give you a hand.zts5206e	You're a true friend! Let's get to work.zts5207e	Phew...zts5208e	You're really full of beans! Thanks for your help. I'll take care of the rest.zts5209e	You've already worked hard enough. Let me take a closer look at this meteorite.zts5210e	As you wish. There's a meteorite chunk over there that looks like a tombstone. But it's emitting a strange kind of energy, so please be careful.zts5211e	??zts5212e	*uff* Supposedly, they're not that strong at all... That is strange.zts5213e	And all that just because of this meteorite? I really need to examine it more closely!zts5214e	I've finally reached the meteorite! Hm? It really does look like a tombstone!zts5215e	Arghh... Why am I... so dizzy...?zts5216e	As you touch the stone, an image appears before your eyes.zts5217e	Where am I? Who are these people?zts5218e	This ugly guy seems to be an assassin. Has he kidnapped this woman, perhaps? Hm... And this guy in red clothing... Is he trying to free her?zts5219e	Their names are well known. The assassin's name is Namaju, the guy in red is called Jajamaru and the kidnapped woman is Princess Sakura.zts5220e	These two guys... they seem to be very strong... Hm? This one guy! He ran away when the gateway appeared...zts5221e	Did the gateway come out of the tombstone? Hm? The tombstone! The meteorite chunk looks exactly the same?!zts5222e	I should take a closer look at the stone...zts5223e	What's that? It looks like a pebble. But the shape is peculiar.zts5224e	When I picked up the pebble near the tombstone, the image suddenly disappeared again.zts5225e	But... The pebble! So it wasn't just an image...zts5226e	This pebble definitely has something to do with the image... Perhaps I can use it to find the people again...zts5227e	This pebble fits perfectly in the hole in the tombstone! I need to talk to someone about this...zts5228e	I must remember where this place is exactly.zts5229e	(You tell Mimi what happened.)zts5230e	Almost sounds like the people are trapped in a card! But there's no way that's possible!zts5231e	Is there any more you can tell me about it?zts5232e	Hm... I'm not sure I can be much help to you there. You should ask Calvin. He might be able to help you.zts5233e	Okay... I'll do that.zts5234e	(You tell Calvin what happened.)zts5235e	Hmm...zts5236e	Do you know anything about it?zts5237e	Yes, I've heard of those cards... but it's not easy freeing people from them...zts5238e	Do you know how it's done? If you know any way at all, please tell me!zts5239e	Hmm... it won't be permanent, but maybe there's a way that we can free them, at least temporarily...zts5240e	Really?zts5241e	Yes. However, you need a specific item call Spirit Essence to do it. I'm sure Malcolm will be able to tell you more about it.zts5242e	All right! Thank you.zts5243e	Malcolm! Malcolm!! Where are you?zts5244e	I'm here. What can I do for you?zts5245e	I need Spirit Essence! Can you tell me where I can get it?zts5246e	Hold your horses. I can make one for you if you need it.zts5247e	Oh, that would be great! Can you do it right away?zts5248e	Hm... It's actually not that complicated... but the required materials... they're not so easy to come by...zts5249e	I will do what I can! Just tell me what you need.zts5250e	Hm... We need pure water and Fairy Dust. Pure water is easy to get hold of, but you need to be very good friends with a fairy if you want her to give you some of her dust.zts5251e	Oh! Hm... Eva! Eva's very close to the fairies...zts5252e	That's right! I'll be right back, Malcolm. It's really urgent, so please start with the preparations.zts5253e	Oh... Okay!zts5254e	Eva!!!zts5255e	Hey! Don't make so much noise! Please be quiet, or you might scare the fairies...zts5256e	Oh, sorry. I'm just in a real hurry...zts5257e	It's okay... but why were you in such a hurry to find me?zts5258e	I need some Fairy Dust. Do you have any?zts5259e	I don't have any at the moment, but I'm sure I can get some if I ask the fairies.zts5260e	Really? Would you ask them for some for me? Please!zts5261e	I'm sure you know about the fairies' fascination with good food, <pname>. If you bring them something delicious, I'm sure they'll give you some dust.zts5262e	Hm... I still need a special spice for the preparation of the food... Could you get 5 portions of Fragrant Grass for me?zts5263e	Yeah, of course! That shouldn't be a problem!zts5264e	Here's the Fragrant Grass!zts5265e	Fantastic! We can make the fairies something delicious with that! I'll just let the fairies know! Please wait a moment.zts5266e	Here's the Fairy Dust you wanted.zts5267e	Thank you!zts5268e	You're welcome. Thanks to you, the fairies had a wonderful meal.zts5269e	(All the necessary materials have now been collected. Jajamaru must be freed as quickly as possible!)zts5270e	Finally, you're back! I've been waiting for you.zts5271e	Please hurry! It's very urgent.zts5272e	Please wait just one moment...zts5273e	So, here you go! Here it is...zts5274e	Oh! Thank you! And sorry for the rush...zts5275e	Ah, that doesn't matter one bit. I'm glad I could help you.zts5276e	(Now it should be possible to free Jajamaru! Off to Calvin, quickly!)zts5277e	Calvin! I have the Spirit Essence! What do I have to do with it now?zts5278e	It's really simple. Pour the essence onto the card.zts5279e	Like this?zts5280e	Yes. Nice and slowly! But bear in mind that you can only bring the person out temporarily.zts5281e	Smoke slowly rises out of the card...zts5282e	Erm... Where am I? Oh, thank you! So you know about the card... We don't have much time. Can you do me a favour?zts5283e	Yes, with pleasure!zts5284e	Thanks. I didn't expect to find a friend like you in a place like this... Simply amazing!zts5285e	Me neither.zts5286e	By the way, did you spot a gateway around here anywhere? I can feel that same strong energy here like I felt in my village.zts5287e	Hmm... I understand they've discovered a new gateway near the NosVille Meadows.zts5288e	Excellent! Through that gate, I can get back to my home village. I've hidden the princess's hairpin there. Can you look for it?zts5289e	A hairpin? Is there something special about it?zts5290e	Yes, it contains the princess's power. It was using her power that I managed to get here.zts5291e	Okay...zts5292e	And I'm the only person who can destroy Namaju.zts5293e	My body may be trapped inside this card, but my power can still be used... Will you use it? I can transfer my entire power to you.zts5294e	Please! Use my power and rescue the princess.zts5295e	Yes, I will! I will rescue her by any means possible.zts5296e	First, you'll have to practice and become acquainted with my powers. That is... unavoidable...zts5297e	Jajamaru has been sealed in the card again.zts5298e	Don't worry, Jajamaru! I will rescue Princess Sakura with your powers!zts5299e	Hello! Just a minute.zts5300e	Hm? What is it?zts5301e	I can feel a very pure power within you, <pname>.zts5302e	Hehe! You're making me all self-conscious...zts5303e	Hm... But this power isn't coming from you, but rather from an item that you're carrying...zts5304e	?zts5305e	Ah! It's this hairpin! Can I have a look at it?zts5306e	Yes, of course.zts5307e	Oh, this power is so... pure! Hm? It feels as if... the owner of this power is trapped somewhere... Is that so?zts5308e	Yes, she is! How did you know that?zts5309e	When I sense a power, it leads me directly to its owner.zts5310e	Can you also release the owner of the power then?zts5311e	Yes, if the hairpin were completely filled with this power... but that's not the case. The power in this hairpin is not enough.zts5312e	Oh... So there's no way to set her free then?zts5313e	I know a way, but... No, forget it. It's not possible.zts5314e	Why not? I'm prepared to do anything! Please tell me.zts5315e	Would you really do anything? Well... Do you know the Wizard Tower?zts5316e	Do you mean... the abandoned Wizard Tower?zts5317e	Yes. It's teeming with monsters created by black magic.zts5318e	And what do I have to do there?zts5319e	Soul Crystals are used in black magic to summon monsters. Kill the monsters and you can loot the crystals. But be careful! Those monsters are extremely powerful...zts5320e	Soul Crystals... Okay, I'll bring them to you!zts5321e	I need the Soul Crystals to make a gemstone out of them. So collect as many Soul Crystals as possible.zts5322e	*panting* Is that enough crystals? Oh, Princess Sakura...zts5323e	The trapped person... She's probably important to you... That's why you're going to so much effort...zts5324e	I promised a friend, and I'm going to keep that promise!zts5325e	I understand... Just a moment. I will help you keep your promise.zts5326e	I've made the gemstone. If you attach it to the hairpin, the energy contained within it will pass over to it.zts5327e	Thanks! Could you attach it now?zts5328e	Yes, of course. Be careful.zts5329e	??zts5330e	When the gemstone touches the hairpin, tremendous energy flows through it.zts5331e	I've never felt an energy like this before.zts5332e	Now there should be enough energy in the hairpin.zts5333e	But where is Princess Sakura? The hairpin is supposed to free her, right?zts5334e	So the name of the person trapped inside is Sakura? Call her name and she will answer you.zts5335e	Ah, I see. Thanks! Thank you so much!zts5336e	Remove Princess Sakura's Seal!zts5337e	Accept Jajamaru Questzts5338e	Hm... Even if it's only for a limited time... he must be freed from this card...zts5339e	Not that I doubt your abilities in any way... but Namaju looks really powerful...zts5340e	<pname>! Why do you hesitate? Jajamaru is with you!zts5341e	Jajamaru, heed my words! I made a promise to you, and I will keep that promise whatever it takes!zts5342e	<pname>! One moment, please.zts5343e	I can feel a very pure power in you, <pname>.zts5344e	Jajamaru Time-Spacezts5345e	Well, I certainly never expected you to come here. Oh! You are Namaju!zts5346e	Huh? Who are you? And how do you know my name?zts5347e	Hey! Over here! I've been trapped in here! Please help me!zts5348e	(This time they must be able to see me... But where is Jajamaru? Can't he follow me?)zts5349e	(It probably isn't wise to start a fight when you can't judge your opponent's strength...) I'll back down this time! If you get in my way, you'll regret it!zts5350e	Erm... Hey! Stop! He's gone again... This assassin is damned quick...zts5351e	What kind of stone is that? Did he drop it on purpose? This shape is really unusual... And these markings... they seem familiar...zts5352e	I've got it! Namaju!zts5353e	Oh! Have you come to rescue me?zts5354e	Hey, you! I've warned you not to get in my way! Kill him!zts5355e	Phew... Those guys were pretty strong. That has cost me a lot of time... I need to hurry and give chase.zts5356e	Where on earth has he gone?! Wait, that sounds like a swordfight... Quick!zts5357e	Hmm? That's... Jajamaru! (How has he got here without using the gateway?) Whatever, we're running out of time! I have to help him.zts5358e	I don't know who you are, but I am very grateful for your help.zts5359e	Don't mention it. The main thing is you're doing well.zts5360e	I won't forget your help! But I have to be going now...zts5361e	Hey! Just a moment! I'll come with you!zts5362e	Namaju! Finally, we meet!zts5363e	What?! Jajamaru?! How did you get here?zts5364e	Jajamaru?! Oh! Please free me! Quick!zts5365e	I will help you, Jajamaru!zts5366e	You? Thanks, but I don't know if your attacks will have any effect on him...zts5367e	(What?! Oh no! My attacks don't even leave a scratch!)zts5368e	Namaju has special powers, so no one except for me can defeat him. Please protect the princess.zts5369e	Arghhh!zts5370e	Ha! What do you say, Namaju?!zts5371e	Uhhh... Jajamaru... I will not surrender!zts5372e	(I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to help him, but the battle is nearly over.)zts5373e	Finally, the time has come to put an end to our struggle. Take that!zts5374e	*Just at that moment Namaju laughs evilly, holding a card in his hand. Jajamaru is suddenly sucked into the card and disappears.*zts5375e	What have you done to Jajamaru?!zts5376e	I've trapped him in the card again! He's safe in there... Jajamaru, that fool! Hahaha!zts5377e	(I don't stand a chance against him alone... I need to retreat. But I will return to free the princess!)zts5378e	Princess Sakura, hang in there! I'll be back to rescue you!zts5379e	Ah, I'd completely forgotten about you! Grab him! Oh, such a perfect day! Mwuhahaha!zts5380e	Hello! You'll pay for this!zts5381e	What?! Did this guy take the card or something? Oh, whatever. I've already trapped Jajamaru in the card anyway. What can he do with it? Muhahaha!zts5382e	Wuah! I very nearly fell... The gate leads straight onto the roof! Now then, the hairpin... Where can it be?zts5383e	Oh no! Those fiends got here before me. I have to find that hairpin before they do...zts5384e	Oh no! I've been spotted...zts5385e	Bah... there's too many of them. But the more of them I fight, the stronger I feel... That must be Jajamaru's power!zts5386e	Found it!zts5387e	Ha! Excellent work. Following you really paid off.zts5388e	What the?! Who are you?zts5389e	You don't know me. (I can feel Jajamaru's power, but how can that be...) Give me the hairpin! Master Namaju wants it.zts5390e	Never! It belongs to Jajamaru, I'll never give it to you.zts5391e	You know Jajamaru?zts5392e	Yes, of course. He's a friend of mine.zts5393e	A friend of Jajamaru... Then I'm afraid I cannot allow you to live. Prepare to meet your maker!zts5394e	Uhhh! But that's Jajamaru's power, no mistake! Against Jajamaru I am absolutely helpless...zts5395e	*gasping* Jajamaru is with me!zts5396e	Ahhh... Then I will confront Jajamaru. Kill me!zts5397e	I don't need your life!zts5398e	*cough* Who are these guys?!zts5399e	Master Namaju wants to speak with you. Don't try to run. We mustn't keep the master waiting.zts5400e	Ha! I'm not running away. Just you wait, Namaju!zts5401e	N.O.S. Event!zts5402e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 1zts5403e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 2zts5404e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 3zts5405e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 4zts5406e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 5zts5407e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 6zts5408e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 7zts5409e	N.O.S. Event Malcolm 8zts5410e	NosCamp Info (Japan)zts5411e	NosVille Alchemy Associationzts5412e	If even I couldn't protect my master...zts5413e	Although my body is trapped in this card, my power can still be used... Want to give it a try?zts5414e	I can transfer my entire power to you. Use it to free the princess.zts5415e	But that...zts5416e	Namaju can only be overcome with my power. Please help me.zts5417e	Okay. I'll take care of it!zts5418e	Here, take this. You'll need it.zts5419e	Is that... a hairpin?zts5420e	Yes. It contains the power of the princess. I was able to get here thanks to that power.zts5421e	Okay... Now I just have to find Namaju...zts5422e	A gateway should have opened up somewhere around here. Since it turned up at the same time as the meteorite, there could well be a connection between them.zts5423e	Ah! It's probably because of this gateway that I could sense this energy in my village!zts5424e	Okay! Then let's free Princess Sakura together!zts5425e	Thank you... I didn't expect to find a friend like you in a place like this... It's just great! With your... support...zts5426e	Jajamaru was trapped in the card again before he could finish talking.zts5427e	It's great being your friend, too... Don't worry, Jajamaru! I will rescue Princess Sakura with your power!zts5428e	Deleted Quest Dialoguezts5429e	Jajamaru Tombstone Questzts5430e	Where am I? Where has all this bamboo come from all of a sudden?zts5431e	Namaju?!zts5432e	Hm? Who are you? And how do you know the name of my master?zts5433e	(Is this a clone of Namaju or something? He looks smaller somehow... And where is Jajamaru?)zts5434e	(I shouldn't risk a battle before I can use all the power...) I'll back down this time! If you get in my way, you'll regret it!zts5435e	If you keep getting in my way, I'll put an end to it! I know no mercy!zts5436e	This clone seems to be quite strong...zts5437e	Phew! I can't keep up with him anymore... I give up...zts5438e	Jajamaru's Sparkling Rockzts5439e	Master Namaju's order was to stop him!zts5440e	Those guys were pretty strong... That has cost me a lot of time... I need to hurry and give chase.zts5441e	Phew! Will this ever be over?zts5442e	What's that sound? It sounds like a swordfight... Quick!zts5443e	It's you... Even if it's only a clone... Namaju has special powers. Please protect the Princess.zts5444e	Uhhh... Jajamaru... If only I could use the full power...zts5445e	(I'm afraid I can't help him... But if I free Princess Sakura, it would be easier for him...)zts5446e	You dare to threaten the Princess! This is unforgivable! Take that!zts5447e	But, at that very moment, Namaju's clone holds a card in his hand, laughing maliciously. Jajamaru is suddenly sucked into the card and disappears.zts5448e	The princess was nothing more than bait from the very start! Now nobody can stop me! Muhaha!zts5449e	(I can't face Namaju alone. But perhaps I can free Jajamaru...)zts5450e	(I feel so bad for Princess Sakura, but I have to escape with the card!)zts5451e	Ah, I'd completely forgotten about you! Trying to run away? Muhahaha! Coward!zts5452e	What?! Did this guy take the card or something? Well, it doesn't matter. I already trapped Jajamaru in the card. What's he gonna do with it? Muhahaha!zts5453e	No one's following me. Thank goodness! I must return to the NosCamp immediately and get help!zts5454e	Jajamaru Raid Sealzts5455e	Do you know what you've got yourself into?zts5456e	I'm here to teach Namaju a lesson!zts5457e	Muhahaha! Brave fool! First, you'll have to beat me before you can face Master Namaju. Muhaha!zts5458e	You're not bad at all. Ha! Let's see how you deal with this attack...zts5459e	Ha! You are really strong! Seems Namaju's days are numbered... Finally! Muhahahaha!zts5460e	Erm... Aren't you Namaju's right-hand man?zts5461e	This is no concern of yours! Muhaha! You have proven yourself worthy... Go now. Hurry!zts5462e	Namaju! Prepare for a tough battle! Muhahaha!zts5463e	That guy... did he want me to beat him, or something? He seemed kind of relieved...zts5464e	Empty dialoguezts5465e	Big Tombstonezts5466e	What does that say?zts5467e	Small Tombstonezts5468e	Hmm... I'm not sure.zts5469e	Act 2 - A Piece of Mount Kremzts5470e	Nice to meet you. I heard you were carrying the soul of a Kovolt inside you.zts5471e	(Hm... hearing that scares me.)zts5472e	We need to build a second NosCamp in Krem. However, the Koaren Chief won't allow it. You must resolve this problem.zts5473e	(Wait! Now people are coming to me and giving me orders instead of asking!)zts5474e	Hey, just a moment!zts5475e	Another thing, soul of the Kovolts...zts5476e	Haha... enough of that. You have to tell me what happened there.zts5477e	Sure, Korrkoaren is helping the army because the soldiers are tired and hungry. But because there are so many enemies everywhere, he needs a helping hand. Now he has decided to ask for support from adventurers like you. He wanted to build a NosCamp here, but he needs the village's consent. The villagers and their chief have to agree on it. However, they still don't trust humans, so we need someone like you. You carry the soul of a Kovolt within you...zts5478e	(That's enough!) Okay! I see. I'll meet with the chief then.zts5479e	End Dialoguezts5480e	How are you doing, Chief?zts5481e	I am fine. I heard a lot about you from Korrkoaren. But if you're here to talk to me about setting up the NosCamp, you're wasting your time.zts5482e	But hear me out first, Chief...zts5483e	I know that it's a good idea. But most of the villagers don't trust humans.zts5484e	Is there anything I can help with?zts5485e	Why do you want to help us?zts5486e	Well... Lord Cuarry is responsible for the fighting between humans and Kovolts, though the war was started by demons. So, now we know that, why shouldn't we fight together?zts5487e	Do you really believe the humans helped us for our sake? More likely they realised their own lives were in danger... No, it's still too early to tell you that. There's still one way you can prove your loyalty to us. Will you accept the challenge?zts5488e	Yes, definitely!zts5489e	Okay, I will give you this one chance then. Colly will explain everything.zts5490e	(A blindfolded Kovolt calls you over.)zts5491e	Hmm... evil powers have come to Mount Krem. They are stealing the energy of the Kovolts! Will you help us?zts5492e	Yes, Magician.zts5493e	The Peak of Mount Krem is a holy place that we Kovolts have to cross. Go there and convince our eight ancestral gods that this energy is not due to the presence of humans. Take them a sacrifice and wash the statues with pure fruit juice to obtain their power. That will free you from the evil energy.zts5494e	Wow!!!zts5495e	Huh?! Statue can talk?! Are you an ancestral god?zts5496e	But... unfortunately, I don't understand what it's saying... Whatever... l will wash it with the juice.zts5497e	Oh! Ooooh!zts5498e	Woohoo!zts5499e	Woo! Ohh...zts5500e	Well, now it sounds like a song.zts5501e	Woo! Ooh... woo!zts5502e	Uhh... woah!zts5503e	Yeea! Woo! Wha... what the hell am I doing?!zts5504e	Oh... woouhhh!zts5505e	(The statue is broken.)zts5506e	Woah! What happened here?zts5507e	Magician, the 8th statue is still broken!zts5508e	Hmmm... what colour was the dust? Was it white or yellow?zts5509e	It was mostly white.zts5510e	This statue was made out of a special clay. It is very rare and therefore hard to find. If someone destroyed the statue, we wouldn't be able to repair it alone. We'd be reliant on the help of humans to repair it.zts5511e	Did you get everything you wanted? Then I will leave now to investigate other places.zts5512e	Yes, take care of yourself.zts5513e	(Kenel disappears.)zts5514e	Boah... that's really heavy. Where's the Catsy anyway? Ah... And who do I have to ask about repairing the statue? I've no idea who would be the right person to ask about that. Maybe Teoman? His job would give him the right skills he needs. Hmm... on the other hand, we're dealing with art, not weaponry. So... what about Slugg?zts5515e	Do you have any idea who could fix the statue?zts5516e	No, I have no idea, and I don't want to hear about it either. I don't like anyone who transforms the earth and abuse it for their own purposes in the name of art.zts5517e	So... you know something, but you just don't want to tell me, right?zts5518e	Pish!zts5519e	Could you just tell me where I might find someone?zts5520e	Hrm... By the way, what's that you're carrying?zts5521e	Ah... You mean this?zts5522e	(You show Slugg the collected clay.)zts5523e	Wow! What are you going to do with that?zts5524e	I'm going to use it to build a statue on the Peak of Mount Krem.zts5525e	I know a lot about the statues up there. Is that all you have?zts5526e	Yes... is it enough?zts5527e	Well... I guess so... perhaps even more than enough. Do you want me to meet a sculptor?zts5528e	Would you?zts5529e	Sure... with pleasure. Give me the clay.zts5530e	(You give the clay to Slugg.)zts5531e	Wait here, I'll be right back.zts5532e	(Slugg leaves and then returns shortly after.)zts5533e	Here it is...zts5534e	Yes...zts5535e	Is it finished now?zts5536e	I have built the statue, Magician.zts5537e	You did a good job. Now the villagers just have to trust humans, then the chief can set up a NosCamp here.zts5538e	Don't thank us. It was our ancestors' plan.zts5539e	(You inform Anni about it.)zts5540e	Really? You've done brilliantly!zts5541e	Haha... Thanks for the compliment.zts5542e	Now... I have a gift for you. Here you go.zts5543e	Thanks, but... that isn't very much for a reward, is it?zts5544e	Not very much? I thought you wanted to become a brave adventurer, not a mercenary, didn't you?zts5545e	Yes, but... still...zts5546e	It's not a reward, but rather something to help rebuild the village. Go and help the people.zts5547e	But that's not a job for an adventurer. Why should I do that?zts5548e	What is an adventurer supposed to do then? The village was destroyed - who should rebuild it? The demons? Lord Cuarry and his knights? No? Then there's only you and the Kovolts left. Go!zts5549e	(Anni pushes you out from behind.)zts5550e	Hrm... Why do I have to do this? How am I supposed change the village by myself?zts5551e	Nothing has changed?zts5552e	Nothing's changing.zts5553e	I'm bored... ah... I'll sing that song I heard near the statue... Ohh... Whaa... Ohh? What's that?zts5554e	Wow! That's... that's the map showing the location of the Kovolts' hidden treasure. I'll show it to Anni.zts5555e	Anni!zts5556e	Finished already? Here's your next task!zts5557e	No... wait... can you take a look at this?zts5558e	Wait!!! Oh my god!!! That's the legendary treasure map... I can't believe it...zts5559e	(Is it real?)zts5560e	The attachment work is now done. Go now and fetch the treasure. I will even give you a reward.zts5561e	That looks very valuable!zts5562e	What's that? What happened?zts5563e	Here's the treasure! Here you go.zts5564e	Wow... you've done a great job! I'll check how much it is worth. Ah, Colly asked for you.zts5565e	Magician Colly? Got it, thanks.zts5566e	Act 2 - Kovolts and Catsieszts5567e	Did you call for me?zts5568e	Hmm... Today, my soul flew around the Time-Space and discovered one of Fernon's seeds growing there. It looked like a Dryad.zts5569e	D... Dryads? Do you think Fernon is coming back to life?zts5570e	Even if I only saw one bud, it might happen in other Time-Spaces, too. So, you have to nip off the bud.zts5571e	Ahhh! I can't get down. I'll have to buy myself a rope from the shop.zts5572e	Yes, the magician was right. There are cocoon shells lying around here, and they look fresh. But there's no sign of them around here. They've disappeared.zts5573e	As you said, Magician, I was able to find traces. But the Dryads seem to have disappeared.zts5574e	Hmm. I already know, and I am very worried. You must find them and stop them!zts5575e	Catsies! Haha! So... I need to calm down first. Okay, okay... first of all, report back. Fernon must be stopped... but Catsies?! Ha!zts5576e	Today... haha... today I saw the Catsies... hahaha...zts5577e	And why are you laughing like that? Have you never seen a Catsy before?zts5578e	Sure, but I was... hahaha... really surprised when I saw the Catsies today... haha...zts5579e	If you've never seen them before, I can understand that. They're a weird species. By the way, we need to find out where they live. We'll need the Catsies in case war breaks out, or for the destruction of Fernon.zts5580e	War?zts5581e	I mean the conflict between the Kovolts and Catsies.zts5582e	Hey, we've only just put one war behind us, and you're already talking about the next one? Why do the Kovolts hate the Catsies? They may look a little strange, but they don't look even the slightest bit dangerous to me.zts5583e	No particular reason. We've simply hated one another from the moment we were born.zts5584e	But that's ridiculous!zts5585e	Lots of things happen without any reason. Haven't you realised that yet?zts5586e	But if we need to fight another war, it will cost us dearly. And what happens if Fernon awakes while we're busy fighting?zts5587e	If it comes to that, the Koaren and Catsies will find some kind of arrangement. After all, we don't want to annihilate one another. In the worst case scenario, humans could maybe arbitrate. Anyway, we need to think about where the Catsies might live. I'll tell you where I think they might be.zts5588e	There's a narrow path. Did she mention that?zts5589e	There seems to be something here.zts5590e	No, there's nothing here. Perhaps they went somewhere else?zts5591e	I went to the place you mentioned, but there were no Catsies there.zts5592e	Ach, these filthy creatures, always running away! Alright, I'll show you another place.zts5593e	A narrow path. Let's go.zts5594e	What? There's nothing here!!!zts5595e	There was nothing there, either. I'm wasting my time.zts5596e	Sorry about that, but this new information comes from a reliable source. Check it out!zts5597e	They must be here...zts5598e	Okay... there could be something here. I should check it out.zts5599e	Oh man... there's nothing here.zts5600e	Nothing there? Just a moment.zts5601e	(Anni goes outside and gives one of the little Kovolts a chocolate bar.)zts5602e	(What is she doing?)zts5603e	I've got it now! This time I'm sure.zts5604e	With just a bar of chocolate? Are you sure?zts5605e	Don't you know the difference? If your information is right, I'll give you a reward. But if you're lying to me, you're in for a nasty punishment. This NosCamp might not have been here very long, but my skills are impressive! So, go now and find the Catsies.zts5606e	Hmmm... I don't know, but I will give it one last try.zts5607e	Yes... there's something here.zts5608e	Uhh... There are too many of them!!! I can't bear them any longer... I'd rather go to Mimi's.zts5609e	Mimi!zts5610e	Ah... Long time no see! How are you?zts5611e	Well, to be honest with you, not great.zts5612e	Really? Do you have a problem? I heard that you were helping Anni.zts5613e	As a matter of fact...zts5614e	(You tell Mimi what happened...)zts5615e	Yes, I understand. The Fernon tree is waking up again?zts5616e	You didn't know that?zts5617e	As the war has only just finished, we have not had a chance to think about it.zts5618e	I need to find the Catsies. Do you have any idea where they are?zts5619e	I don't know exactly, but I do know a path which the Catsies use from time to time.zts5620e	Arghhh!!! Yes, thanks Mimi.zts5621e	What happened to Kenel? He fought to destroy Fernon before. I thought I knew him. If I don't do anything now, then soon no one will be able to destroy that tree. I have to find Catlotte before Kenel does.zts5622e	Act 2 - More Kovolts and Catsieszts5623e	The Catsy princess? This is our chance. You'll have to do your best this time!zts5624e	I'm already doing my best!zts5625e	Well I just can't emphasise that enough. I'm revealing a very important source of information to you, so get a move on.zts5626e	Assuming the information is accurate... (Boy do I miss Mimi.)zts5627e	I'll find out before Mimi does.zts5628e	A recommendation to come here... Err... and you are?zts5629e	When I see you again, I need that hat.zts5630e	Hat?! What the heck are you talking about?zts5631e	Did you think you'd get the information for free?zts5632e	No, no... of course I'll pay for it. Would you be happy with any hat?zts5633e	A fashion expert like myself would never wear a regular hat. You'll need this.zts5634e	A pickaxe? I'm supposed to make a hat with a pickaxe?zts5635e	Pish, pish! And I'm supposed to do business with you? If you need a clue, ask Anni. She might know more about it.zts5636e	You're back early. Did he give you the information for free? How is that possible?zts5637e	Right. He said he wanted a hat, and then he gave me this pickaxe.zts5638e	Hohoho... he hasn't changed at all. Use the pickaxe near the village and bring me sparkling stones.zts5639e	Yes? (How can she me a hat out of stones?)zts5640e	How am I supposed to make a hat out of stone? Whatever, Anni will do it.zts5641e	Here it is, but are you really going to make a hat out of stone?zts5642e	Don't be ridiculous. The stone is just for decoration.zts5643e	Ahh... yeah... I knew... it was just a joke.zts5644e	It's okay, the hat will be made of fabric. So... bring me a few pieces of high-quality fabric.zts5645e	Hmm... yes, you've brought some good material.zts5646e	As I said, I knew you couldn't make a hat out of stones. I'm not stupid!zts5647e	Yeah, yeah... it's okay. Be quiet now and I'll make you a nice hat.zts5648e	(Anni is sewing a hat.)zts5649e	Wow... you can sew... I didn't know you were so talented.zts5650e	Seems you underestimated me. Okay, it's finished. Now it's your turn. Take it and do a good job.zts5651e	Okay. For that I'll pass on this useful piece of information: the princess of the Catsies can now be found in the monster hunting grounds. Head over there and check it out.zts5652e	Catlotte has to leave. I will ask Anni.zts5653e	That's... what's a Catsy doing here?! Only Kovolts are permitted to enter the Misty Valley...zts5654e	The Misty Valley? Do you think Catlotte might be there?zts5655e	It's possible. But even if that's the case, it won't be easy.zts5656e	What do you mean?zts5657e	Exactly as its name suggests, the Misty Valley is always shrouded in a thick fog. And not your regular fog either, but poisonous fog. Nobody can remain there for long. To make matters worse, the place is crawling with monsters.zts5658e	Then we might as well just give up?zts5659e	Well, there is still another way, but it's very risky. I couldn't possibly ask of you to undertake it, <pname>. If you don't want to, you can quit right here.zts5660e	No, I have to meet Catlotte. Please, tell me what this other way is.zts5661e	Fine, I'll tell you what you wish to know. Once each month, Mount Krem is bathed in a mysterious twilight. We can use this mysterious energy to make a mask which would protect you from the poison. It just so happens that today is that day. Place this cloth at the peak of Mount Krem and it will turn red. Bring it back to me tomorrow and I will create the mask for you.zts5662e	The fabric is turning red!zts5663e	Here's the mask.zts5664e	Thanks. Now I will go and search for Catlotte!zts5665e	Oh, just one moment.zts5666e	It won't be easy, so take good care of yourself.zts5667e	Hmm? I've got a bad feeling. By the way, what is that?zts5668e	Is that Kenel and Catlotte? What... what should I do now? I don't know, but I can't leave Catlotte there.zts5669e	What? And you just watched Kenel kidnap her?zts5670e	What?! And you just stood by and watched Kenel kidnap her?zts5671e	There was nothing I could do. In fact, it looked as if Catlotte was submitting to it. But I have to protect her. Do you know where she could be?zts5672e	If she's been kidnapped by Kenel, then the chances are she's being kept in an underground prison...zts5673e	Underground prison? Where is it?zts5674e	Let me finish. Nobody knows the location except for the Kovolt elders.zts5675e	Fine, then I will go and ask the elders.zts5676e	Hmm... they're not going to reveal the location to you just like that.zts5677e	What brings you here, young adventurer?zts5678e	Yes, I want to know where the underground prison is.zts5679e	Young adventurer, we don't just disclose our secrets to other peoples!zts5680e	I'm well aware of that, but it's really important, and I'm willing to do everything I can. Please tell me.zts5681e	Haha... if you're so desperate, bring me some beasts' teeth. If you can stay alive, I will tell you.zts5682e	Are they still alive???zts5683e	Haha... Oh yes. Bring me the teeth of the legendary beasts. To do so, however, you'll have to cross the holy land of the Kovolt warriors. Otherwise, you won't make it to the beasts. Haha, but unfortunately, the souls of the warriors won't let you pass.zts5684e	(Just like Anni said, he doesn't want to help me.) Okay, I'll return, you'll see. I will return in one piece and bring you the teeth. But you have to keep your promise when I return.zts5685e	Woah! That's the sort of monster the elder spoke of. That could have been the death of me. Old man, you'll live to regret it if you don't keep your promise!zts5686e	Here they are, the teeth of the beasts!zts5687e	What? Are those really the teeth? That cannot be. Those were the legendary beasts; how could you do that?zts5688e	You can see that I did it. It was very dangerous, but I was victorious!zts5689e	Now I know you're lying. You've brought me forgeries and are insisting that they're from real beasts. Do you think you can deceive me?zts5690e	How can you think that of me?!zts5691e	No? Calm down, I'm only joking. At second glance, they are indeed teeth of the beasts.zts5692e	Pish!!!zts5693e	(Carven is ashamed.) Hmm? So, you want to know something about the underground prison, right? All right, I'll tell you.zts5694e	I never would have expected Kenel could do such a thing... He might even have injured Catlotte!zts5695e	Neither the Family Head nor the Family Keepers can leave the family. Family members who leave must wait 24 hours before they can join another family.zts5696e	Annizts5697e	Anni Main Questzts5698e	Level 56 - NosCamp Cave on Mount Kremzts5699e	Level 57 - Kovolts and Catsieszts5700e	Level 60 - Revival of the Kenkoszts5701e	Teoman Main Questzts5702e	Level 61 - Death to the Kenkos!zts5703e	The Peak of Mount Krem is a holy place that we Kovolts have to cross. Go there and convince our eight ancestral gods that this energy is not due to the presence of humans. Take them a sacrifice and wash the statues with pure fruit juice to obtain their power. That will free you from the evil energy.zts5704e	Magician, one of the statues is broken!zts5705e	Boah... that's really heavy. Where's the Catsy anyway? Ah... And who do I have to ask about repairing the statue? I've no idea who would be the right person to ask about that. Maybe Teoman? His job would give him the right skills he needs. Hmm... on the other hand, we're dealing with art, not weaponry. So... what about Slugg?zts5706e	(You inform Anni about it.)zts5707e	Catsies... the Kovolts' hatred towards these people is even worse than the mistrust they harbour towards humans.zts5708e	Hmm... I think this could be the perfect opportunity to improved relations with the Kovolts.zts5709e	Why can't the Kovolts get along with the Catsies?zts5710e	First off, we need to catch the Catsies - before anyone else does. I know a place where the Catsies like to hand around. Let's go there!zts5711e	Hey!zts5712e	Come on!zts5713e	Really? I have more information. This time it should be safe.zts5714e	There weren't any Catsies, only monsters.zts5715e	Because they only rarely go outside. But my sources are widely spread.zts5716e	This direction. Try there.zts5717e	Just a moment, I'll ask around and let you know.zts5718e	(A short while later...)zts5719e	I'm not sure, but someone told me he had seen some Catsies somewhere. Want to try your luck?zts5720e	Ah! But I heard that Kovolts are speeding there.zts5721e	Ah... okay.zts5722e	There may have been some misunderstandings, but one thing is certain: I need to find the Catsy princess before Kenel does.zts5723e	The Catsy princess? This is our chance. You... you have to do your best to find her in time!zts5724e	Yes, I know that. But please give me correct information this time.zts5725e	Of course. I'll introduce you to the best sources of information. Hurry!zts5726e	Is that the place Anni mentioned?zts5727e	Anni asked me to come here. Just a moment... don't I know you?zts5728e	You again! Get rid of these guys. They're too noisy!zts5729e	Do you really mean those guys there?zts5730e	Yes... them over there. Get rid of them or shut them up. They're irritating me.zts5731e	But why should I follow your orders?zts5732e	Didn't you come here to find something out? It's all right if not.zts5733e	No, no... I'll handle this and then come straight back.zts5734e	Hmm... I'd better be quiet now. Otherwise, he might break his promise...zts5735e	Yes, it's quiet now. Now, I want to have a hat.zts5736e	Don't you need the information?zts5737e	Okay... good... now I'll give you the information. Go to the place I'm showing you.zts5738e	('Misty Valley' is written in lipstick on a small hand mirror.)zts5739e	That must be the Catsy princess's mirror. I'd better ask Anni.zts5740e	Hm... The Misty Valley...zts5741e	What kind of place is that?zts5742e	The Misty Valley is, as the name says, always surrounded by dense fog. However, it is no ordinary fog; it's poisonous fog. So, nobody can stay there for a long time. And worse still, this valley is guarded by strong demons - the Foggy Colossi.zts5743e	Really... so, what do I have to do?zts5744e	There's nothing I can do about the colossi, but I can make a mask for you. It will protect you from being poisoned.zts5745e	A sunset red-coloured mask can protect you against the poison of the Foggy valley.zts5746e	How can I get that?zts5747e	You can get the most powerful sunset on the Sunset Cliff on the Peak of Mount Krem. Go there.zts5748e	If you lay a piece of high-quality fabric in the sunset, it will turn red.zts5749e	Thanks. Now I want to start looking for the Catsy princess.zts5750e	Too much time has passed. Do you know how important this mission is for our NosCamp?zts5751e	Yes, of course. (Is she nagging again?)zts5752e	I thought it was fog. But it was a demon. A very strong demon! Ahhh! What would I have done without the mask? I'd rather not even think about it.zts5753e	What? Do you think we've missed our chance for victory?zts5754e	Anni! That's not important.zts5755e	Yes... it is very IMPORTANT!zts5756e	Anni, please calm down.zts5757e	Do you know how many times we've already missed the chance?zts5758e	I know, but the opportunity for a big success will come.zts5759e	What do you mean? Do you mean we have another opportunity?zts5760e	Don't you know that Catlotte will play a decisive role in the sealing of Fernon?zts5761e	If we can rescue her and seal Fernon again... what could surpass that achievement?zts5762e	Hmmm...zts5763e	Kenel kidnapped her because of the old hatred for her people.zts5764e	If we cannot rescue Catlotte, we will miss the chance to seal Fernon. We have to find her immediately.zts5765e	Hmmm... if she's being held by Kenel, she must be in the underground prison.zts5766e	That's the question... because that place hasn't been used for such a long time, many young Kovolts don't know of its existence.zts5767e	Perhaps some of the old Kovolts remember it.zts5768e	An old Kovolt? I think I know just the person...zts5769e	You can't make any mistakes now. You have to be successful on Mount Krem, do you understand?zts5770e	I know it's asking a lot, but I need to know. I will do whatever you as of me, so please give me a chance!zts5771e	Haha... Oh yes. Bring me the teeth of the legendary beasts. To do so, however, you'll have to cross the holy land of the Kovolt warriors. Otherwise, you won't make it to the beasts. Haha, but unfortunately, the souls of the warriors won't let you pass.zts5772e	Okay! I will return in one piece and bring you the teeth. But you have to keep your promise when I return.zts5773e	Huh?! What a monster that is. As the old man said, I could be dead.zts5774e	Both sides have affirmed that they want to agree a peace treaty... but there's a long way to go until we get there.zts5775e	Act 2 - Kenko's Resurrectionzts5776e	(You explain to Anni what happened.)zts5777e	A peace treaty between the Kovolts and the Catsies? Sounds great. But they've never been able to stand each other... that's going to be hard work.zts5778e	I know, but I have to try. Do you know where Cenil is?zts5779e	Hmm... I know... By the way, take a look at this.zts5780e	What is that?zts5781e	Maybe you've heard that there are a lot of treasures hidden inside Mount Krem. I've got a treasure map here.zts5782e	Anni! It's not the right time to be thinking about treasure.zts5783e	Listen. This vase is an antique Kovolt artefact. If the peace treaty isn't agreed, the Kovolts' reaction will be extremely hostile.zts5784e	So it's also important to cement the Kovolts' goodwill towards us through such actions. Do you understand?zts5785e	Anni?zts5786e	Are you surprised? Why not? Once I set myself a goal, I'll do everything to achieve it. Now, let's go!zts5787e	I'm sorry. I didn't know that, and thought that you only every think about treasure.zts5788e	Hoho! Go now!zts5789e	Hmm... Anni is very thoughtful. Until now, I always thought she was only ever out to do business.zts5790e	Good work.zts5791e	Glad to hear it! Did you find Cenil?zts5792e	I know. But I think Kenel is trying to thwart our plan.zts5793e	Who? Kenel?zts5794e	Yes, he could never change his attitude and work together with the Catsies. That's completely out of the question for him.zts5795e	Kenel? I hope he doesn't stand in my way.zts5796e	Beware of him.zts5797e	How stupid I was. I should never have trusted Catrisha and given her the letter. Anyway, finding Cenil is more important now.zts5798e	But... where can I find Cenil? Mount Krem is dangerous and I can't go back to Anni! Right... Mimi. I still have Mimi.zts5799e	Hi, long time no see. Tell me, is something troubling you? You look pale...zts5800e	If I'm being honest, yes.zts5801e	(You explain what has happened.)zts5802e	I don't understand why they don't want to live with each other in peace.zts5803e	Me neither. Do you know where I can find Cenil?zts5804e	Cenil called by here recently. She was searching for the Kovolt village. I think she's still nearby.zts5805e	Ah. Thanks. I'll go and look for her.zts5806e	Thank you. Good luck!zts5807e	What should I do? Two species, Kovolts and Catsies... there's so much tension between them. Right now, I have no other option than to trust the Darksies... Should I inform Anni?zts5808e	You're back. How's the work going?zts5809e	Honestly... I don't know what happened here...zts5810e	I didn't expect a lot. Mediation between the two peoples was very difficult to begin with. Oh! By the way, the magician is looking for you.zts5811e	Magician Colly? Hmm? Why not?zts5812e	You, human!!! You've finally come to me. I couldn't sleep as the situation is getting more and more serious.zts5813e	What do you mean? Any problems?zts5814e	Yes... It seems Kenko is doing something evil. You have to stop him before his power grows. While you weren't here, I sent some agents after him. Now, go to the village chief and ask him where Kenko is. Go, human.zts5815e	Oh, welcome. Colly told me that you'd returned. I am so relieved that you're back.zts5816e	Hello, Chief. I heard your agents were searching for Kenko. Did they find it?zts5817e	Yes, my agents will tell you where you Kenko's spies can often be found. Catch them and ask them where Kenko is.zts5818e	What is that? Something has been written here.zts5819e	Something has been written here again, and this section fits with the first. They must have belonged together originally.zts5820e	Ah okay, it all fits together. Now I just need one more corner and the letter will be complete.zts5821e	Let's see. It looks like I've found all the pieces. But I can't read it. Was the message written in the language of the Kenkos perhaps? Maybe the Koaren can read the letter.zts5822e	Chief, I have found a clue.zts5823e	Welcome. Let me see what you have found.zts5824e	It looks like a letter, but I cannot read it.zts5825e	Hmm? This is Kenko's military plan. Now I know what he's planning and how to thwart him.zts5826e	I will do it!zts5827e	Yes... you might be the only person who dares to face Kenko. The demons have probably already joined him, so be careful.zts5828e	Princess Catlotte was kidnapped by Kenko. What should I do? If Kenko is hiding, no one will be able to find him. Something terrible will happen to Catlotte. The Kovolts and Catsies will never make peace.zts5829e	Yes... right. I remember that that Catsy smelt very strange. I can use the same trick again... haha...zts5830e	Act 2 - Kenko's Deathzts5831e	Long time no see. What brings you here? If you need a better item, just say.zts5832e	Haha... that's not why I'm here today. I wanted to meet up with Teodor, but I can't find him. Do you know where he is?zts5833e	He left a short while ago, but I can help you, too. You can trust me. Come on, what do you need?zts5834e	I'm really here on other business, but I'll stop by again soon - when I have more money in my pocket.zts5835e	Hey, long time no see. How have you been?zts5836e	Hi, how are you doing? I need a sniffer again, so I wanted to ask if you could lend me the Sniffer Net.zts5837e	Pish! You only come to see me when you need something, don't you?zts5838e	Sorry about that, but I've been so busy.zts5839e	Yes... I understand. An adventurer with great abilities must be in such a hurry. That's normal. Anyway, here's the net.zts5840e	Are you giving it to me for free?zts5841e	Yes... it's a special present to you, my old friend. But it's only free for TODAY.zts5842e	(Wow, I hadn't expected to get it for free.) Thanks... thanks so much.zts5843e	Urghhh... such an ugly bug. But still, you have an excellent sense of smell, so now you have to find Catlotte.zts5844e	Did you understand me when I said 'ugly'? Why aren't you moving? Are you angry with me? Sorry... it was just a joke, so come on now!!!zts5845e	Puhaha!! This bug doesn't move until it smells something. How stupid of me... haha.zts5846e	(You look around.)zts5847e	Hey!!! Nobody saw me, haha... As Mimi is a close friend of Catlotte's, she must know what perfume Catlotte uses.zts5848e	What? Catlotte has been kidnapped by Kenko? Oh no... that's terrible. We have to find her!zts5849e	Yes, you're right, so first we have to find Kenko. Do you know what kind of perfume Catlotte uses?zts5850e	Yes, I gave it to her as a present, and I have some left over.zts5851e	Great! Let this Sniffer smell it then.zts5852e	Sure, just a moment.zts5853e	(Mini allows the Sniffer to smell the perfume.)zts5854e	Wow... now it's starting to move. Thanks, Mimi.zts5855e	Thank you, but please hurry. Catlotte is in danger.zts5856e	Woah! This place is so dangerous. There are so many monsters roaming around, and they're probably not going to leave me in peace.zts5857e	Hey! I barely made it. They were very strong.zts5858e	She must be around here somewhere... Let's split up. I'll go this way, and you can check the path over there.zts5859e	There's a broom... uhhh? Something's written on it. A message from a Catsy?zts5860e	(There is a rose in this dark place. When it blossoms, will eternal peace reign?)zts5861e	A rose? Hm, wait a minute! The rose and the Catsies... Is the rose a symbol for the Rosebud Whitewitches, perhaps?zts5862e	Hmm... it seems like the message actually has a deeper meaning... I should examine it more closely.zts5863e	Aha! The 'dark place' - that could be here. And there's supposedly a rose somewhere nearby? But a rose doesn't shine by itself... perhaps there isn't a rose. I should search the area.zts5864e	Hmm? A picture of a rose? It's shining! The message on the broom must be referring to this! This picture hides a secret... let's see...zts5865e	It doesn't look like there's anything hidden there... but the picture is very well painted. It looks like a real rose!zts5866e	(Suddenly, as you touch the rose, a narrow path in the wall opens up.)zts5867e	Haha... a secret path? I feel like a hero. Okay, I will check it out, just like a real hero.zts5868e	Rosebud Whitewitch 1: Who's there?zts5869e	Huh?! Rosebud Witches?zts5870e	Rosebud Whitewitch 2: If you've come to spy on us, you won't leave here alive. Sisters! Attack!zts5871e	W... what?! (Words are probably not much help now. I need to 'calm' them another way.)zts5872e	Rosebud Whitewitch 1: How could we be beaten by a feeble human?zts5873e	Hey! I'm on your side. I'm looking for Catlotte, and I just found this place by accident.zts5874e	Rosebud Whitewitch 2: Ah, so you're the adventurer who helped our princess?zts5875e	Yes... that's right, that was me.zts5876e	Rosebud Whitewitch 1: If you are that adventurer, can you help us? We could deal with the Kovolts fine ourselves, but there are just too many demons there, and they're too strong for us.zts5877e	Do you know where Catlotte is?zts5878e	Rosebud Whitewitch 1: Go to the site of our last battle. But quite some time has passed since that battle, so I'm not sure if she's still there.zts5879e	This must be the place... it's full of noisy devils. They're not just going to let me pass.zts5880e	*panting* Where are all these demons coming from? Has the rift in the Time-Space got bigger?zts5881e	I hope Catlotte is okay. So much time has passed, so we need to hurry before something happens to her.zts5882e	The trail's going cold. Let's hurry.zts5883e	Urghhh! All right, you monsters. I will destroy you all.zts5884e	Phew! I think that's enough for now. But now we need to hurry.zts5885e	Where are we going now?zts5886e	We're too slow. If he wants to resurrect Fernon using Catlotte's power, he'll need to take her to the hidden altar.zts5887e	Hidden altar?zts5888e	Yes. The ritual has to be conducted at the hidden altar, otherwise it won't work.zts5889e	Let's go there then.zts5890e	You need to know that the altar is located at the centre of the Labyrinth of Pain. And the entrance is sealed. No one can approach the altar without breaking the seal.zts5891e	What are you afraid of? If we work together, there's nothing that can stop us. Let's go then.zts5892e	Haha... you sound very confident. Good! But you must be very careful.zts5893e	Somewhere over there is the centre of the labyrinth where the altar starts.zts5894e	Yuck!!! What a disgusting statue!zts5895e	To reach the heart of the labyrinth, we need to break open this statue first.zts5896e	Haha! Okay, one decent punch and it should burst open... ha-yah!zts5897e	(You try to break open the statue with a punch, but you don't even make a scratch on it.)zts5898e	No way... it's not possible.zts5899e	It's not your fault. People call it the Statue of Terror, and no one can break it without the Hammer of Pain. One of the guardians must have it on them.zts5900e	Guardians? What guardians exactly?zts5901e	Hahaha!!! I like you!zts5902e	What are those guys?! They're carrying strange weapons...zts5903e	Right. They look ugly, but they're strong. If we hadn't worked together, they would have chased us.zts5904e	I can't believe how easy it was to break the statue with the hammer...zts5905e	Hurry up! We need to put an end to this, fast!zts5906e	Wait a second!zts5907e	This key... there's something strange about it. Take a look. The decoration has been damaged.zts5908e	What kind of gemstone is that? It's a black diamond. But look closely... the settings for the diamonds. There's space for five of them, but it only contains one diamond at the moment.zts5909e	So, what do we have to do then?zts5910e	Do you mean the black diamonds? Shiny black stones? If so, I can show you where to find them.zts5911e	Really? Let's go there then.zts5912e	Now we have the diamonds, but how can we put them into the settings?zts5913e	Leave that to me. The great Soraya lives in my village, and she makes accessories.zts5914e	<pname>!! It's been such a long time since I last saw you. How are you? I heard you're very busy these days.zts5915e	That's right! And how are you? Hmmm, to be completely honest...zts5916e	Huh? Resurrection of Fernon? It's so terrible. Let me see the key. I'll repair it.zts5917e	(Soraya takes the key and quickly enters her workshop.)zts5918e	Here's the key. Take a look at it. Isn't it enchanting?zts5919e	Thanks, Soraya.zts5920e	Say no more of it. Take the key and help everyone.zts5921e	Catlotte : Thank you for your help, great knight.zts5922e	Player: Oh, don't mention it. I was only doing my duty. The others here are more deserving of your gratitude.zts5923e	Catlotte: Patty, you're here too.zts5924e	Patty: You must have had a harder time than I did. But everything will be alright from here on out. We don't have to fight the Kovolts anymore. Right, Kenel?zts5925e	Kenel: *clearing his throat* Hmm... I don't know anything about that. I just follow my master's orders.zts5926e	Catlotte: Aha!! So that's why you disobeyed Korrkoaren and imprisoned me?zts5927e	Kenel: So what? Are you still angry with me or something? Grrrr!zts5928e	Catlotte: Hoho! Just a joke. We really appreciate your help, Kenel.zts5930e	Woah! That's heavy.zts5931e	(You give the clay to Slugg.)zts5932e	I'll leave maintaining relations with the Kovolts up to you. But where is Cenil?zts5933e	The centre of the Labyrinth of Pain is over there. Hey, brave adventurer! Are you ready?zts5934e	Haha... My body feels so powerful. Patty, Kenel! Let's go!zts5935e	Patty: You must have had a harder time than I did. But everything turned out for the best. We don't have to fight the Kovolts anymore. Right, Kenel?zts5936e	Thank you for rescuing me, brave knight!zts5937e	Don't say that. I was only doing my duty. The other guys deserve your gratitude, though.zts5938e	Patty, you're here too.zts5939e	You must have had a harder time than I did. But everything turned out okay. We don't have to fight the Kovolts anymore. Right, Kenel?zts5940e	*clearing throat* Hmm... I don't know much about that. I just follow my master's orders.zts5941e	Aha! So that's why you disobeyed Korrkoaren and imprisoned me?zts5942e	So what? Are you still angry with me, or something??? Grrrr?zts5943e	Hoho! Just a joke.

Soraya? What are you wearing?zts5987e	Oh, this? Well, you know... about my feelings for Calvin...zts5988e	Some adventurers gave this to me because they thought Calvin might notice me in it.zts5989e	Wow! It looks great on you!zts5990e	Really? Do you think so? I don't normally wear things like this. It makes me feel a little embarrassed.zts5991e	You've no reason to, you look great in it! Have you told him what you think about him?zts5992e	No, not yet... I'm too afraid...zts5993e	(She still hasn't told him... but I'm rather surprised that she's wearing clothes like that.)zts5994e	Oh Soraya, is that the dress?zts5995e	Oh, yes. What do you think? Does it suit me?zts5996e	Without question! You look fantastic!zts5997e	Thank you! But I have to admit, I'm a little embarrassed. I don't normally wear things like this.zts5998e	Hahaha! No need to be embarrassed, you look so beautiful...zts5999e	Thank you for saying so, <pname>.zts6000e	Have you told Calvin yet what you think about him?zts6001e	Well, not exactly... I'm too shy...zts6002e	(She still hasn't told him yet... I guess I'll have to think of something else.)zts6003e	Ah, Soraya, you're wearing the dress!zts6004e	Yes, <pname>. Does it suit me?zts6005e	Of course! You look fantastic in it!zts6006e	Thank you for saying so, <pname>!zts6007e	So have you confessed your love for Calvin?zts6008e	Well... not exactly...zts6009e	Why not? Was it the dress?zts6010e	No, not in the slightest! It's me...zts6011e	(She still hasn't owned up to her feelings. Never mind, I'll keep helping her until she finally tells him!)zts6012e	Oh, so we meet again!zts6013e	Hunt the Koaren! Kill anyone who tries to get away!zts6014e	Check how many times I have been recommended.zts6015e	Act 3 - Investigating the Secret Labzts6016e	Wow! The spirit of a Kovolt warrior trapped inside the body of a human. Fantastic!zts6017e	Hmm... (Weird... is that supposed to be a compliment or a joke?)zts6018e	Thanks to you, our camp on Mount Krem has become famous. The Koaren chief wants to see you so he can thank you personally. Go visit him.zts6019e	Sure!zts6020e	What are you still doing? Get going! Oh yes, one more thing... if the chief gives you a good present... it's mine!zts6021e	Welcome! Kenel told me that you defeated Kukukeen... many thanks!zts6022e	You're welcome.zts6023e	In recognition of the service you have done for our tribe, I hereby declare you a Koaren warrior!zts6024e	(The Koaren chief draws a deep breath and then roars.)zts6025e	Henceforth you shall be known as Kang Kang Koaren. May Zenas protect your Koaren soul.zts6026e	(The Koaren applaud as they listen to the announcement.)zts6027e	God bless Kang Kang Koaren!zts6028e	(Ironically.) Hooray.zts6029e	Enjoy the party. Today our tribe has been blessed with a new warrior. Let's celebrate the new born warrior!zts6030e	(Doggo appears as the party gets into full swing.)zts6031e	Anni's calling... she said something but I didn't understand what...zts6032e	Anni? Alright, I understand...zts6033e	Welcome, Kang Kang Koaren! You are now a Kovolt!zts6034e	What the... Stop that!zts6035e	(Something must be really funny, judging by way Anni's trying to keep her mouth straight. Did she call on me because something serious happened?)zts6036e	I came here as I heard there's something urgent?zts6037e	Urgent? Oh, right! Did Doggo send you?zts6038e	Yes...zts6039e	(Anni mumbles something while biting her nails.)zts6040e	(What's she playing at?)zts6041e	Here.zts6042e	(Anni hands you a big pile of papers.)zts6043e	Erm... what is this?zts6044e	There's work to be done... work for you.zts6045e	Err... I was told there'd be nothing to do for a while...zts6046e	Well, what you were told is wrong.zts6047e	(Something's wrong here.)zts6048e	Everyone else who could've done this task has run away. And that after I spent hours explaining all the details! That leaves just the two of us from NosCamp who can deal with it.zts6049e	Oh, boy! What do I have to do?zts6050e	Take these papers to the Secret Lab and then write a report. I'm told that there are strange things happening in that lab. It shouldn't be dangerous, so don't worry too much.zts6051e	(There's something she's not telling me...) Do I really need all this paper?zts6052e	Yep, you'll need them all. You know how to use them, right?zts6053e	Isn't this just regular paper?zts6054e	No, it's magical paper! When you say the magic words, you'll be able to see the area around you on the map.zts6055e	What are the magic words?zts6056e	You simply say: 'I am Kang Kang Koaren'. Loud and clear.zts6057e	Riiight... (Is this some kind of a joke?)zts6058e	Take a look over the information I attached about the lab. Good luck! And don't forget how to use the paper.zts6059e	(You read over the information detailed in this report entitled: NosCamp Adventurer's Report)zts6060e	1) It's a dark place. There's something clinging to my leg. But it's too dark to see.zts6061e	2) This place is inaccessible even to the Kovolts. According to the Koaren, strange things happen in the lab at night. No one wants to go anywhere near.zts6062e	3) Lord Cuarry closed this location. But I wonder why he did that himself?zts6063e	4) Some other adventurers have already tried to investigate, but they all disappeared. I'm entering the lab to find out more. Communication interrupted.zts6064e	5) Access only for experienced adventurers. Enter at own risk. Signed: Lord Cuarryzts6065e	(You unemotionally tear the page to pieces.)zts6066e	Experienced adventurers? Enter at your own risk??? What the... I've been tricked! Someone will pay for this!zts6067e	(You suddenly wake up.)zts6068e	Good morning!zts6069e	Boo!zts6070e	(You're startled.)zts6071e	Good morning. You were injured badly.zts6072e	Thanks for looking after me, but...zts6073e	... how did you get here? You can thank Doggo for that. I can tell you it was a surprise when he laid you down here.zts6074e	(Doggo is sleeping like a stone.)zts6075e	(Thanks, Doggo.)zts6076e	Just so you know, I was the one who patched you up. I'll deduct the costs from your reward. Now get back out there and bring me your finished report pronto!zts6077e	That's not fair, I am still injured...zts6078e	(Anni giggles mockingly.) I knew you'd moan. I gave you something special... purely 'medicinal' you understand. You'll survive. The doctors from Mount Krem weren't willing to give me any other medicine for a reasonable price. But it appears my little investment paid off.zts6079e	Uuuhhh...zts6080e	(You explain to Anni what happened in the laboratory.)zts6081e	So you're saying something's wrong?zts6082e	Yes. What the earlier reports say isn't always true. I think that something is hiding there.zts6083e	Hmm... I can almost smell the intrigue!zts6084e	Something fishy?zts6085e	More like money. The bigger the risk, the greater the rewards! If you're right, and something dangerous really is lurking down there, then there's a good chance you could discover some serious treasure.zts6086e	(This person is such a...)zts6087e	Fine... the laboratory is more dangerous than we thought. Let's ask Doggo if he'll join you.zts6088e	But remember! Bring me any treasures you find!zts6089e	Go to the Secret Lab?zts6090e	Yes, it's dangerous to go it alone. I'd like your help.zts6091e	That place smells like death. I'm not going in there. But if Anni sends me, there's not a lot I can do about it. However, I need to prepare some things, so why don't you go on ahead.zts6092e	See you on the 2nd floor of the lab.zts6093e	Okay.zts6094e	The shadow of Zenas? Hmm... I think that's enough for an the initial investigation.zts6095e	Haha, looks like that special 'medicine' was just the thing. The report is finally finished. It'll certainly have a positive impact on my finances, hehe. I hope I've got enough space for all that money I'm going to earn... great job!zts6096e	Empty dialoguezts6097e	Act 3 - Everyone's Changingzts6098e	Who knows more about the ring?zts6099e	Act 3 - Everyone's Changing... Part IIzts6100e	(You show Soraya Radal's rings. Soraya looks at them curiously.)zts6101e	The rings are blue and red. It seems they have some kind of hidden powers. Different spells have been cast on them.zts6102e	Can you find out anything else?zts6103e	Wait a second.zts6104e	(After a few moments, Soraya shakes her head.)zts6105e	No, I can't see anything more. It's almost as if there were an evil spell on these rings...zts6106e	Is there anyone else who might know more?zts6107e	Maybe the Catsies will know more about it.zts6108e	(Catlotte said she wanted to stay with the Koaren for a while. The Koaren chief ought to know where she is.)zts6109e	The Catsies? They're no longer in town. They were always complaining: the food wasn't good enough, the beds were too hard etc.zts6110e	So you kicked them out?zts6111e	What kind of monster do you take me for? I can't throw out anyone who helped the Koaren in danger. They said they would look for a better place to stay, somewhere they would feel comfortable.zts6112e	Do you know where they went?zts6113e	I asked Korrkoaren to watch out for them. I was told they were stopped on the way to NosVille.zts6114e	The Catsies? Yes, I've seen them. They said they wanted to visit some friends. Presumably they meant Mimi? She's the only person in NosVille who's really good friends with the Catsies.zts6115e	Hello. Yes? Ah, Catlotte and Catrisha? They were complaining a lot about the Koarens on Mount Krem. They said they were on the lookout for a new place where they could settle. I believe they went to Fir Forest.zts6116e	Do I know about the Pearl of Dusk? But of course! I can't think of anybody who loves jewellery who hasn't heard of that legendary pearl. Legend has it that there's a thousand-year-old clam living in the underwater caves below the cliffs. I've never seen it with my own owns, but I'm certain the legend is true. However, there is one problem.zts6117e	Problem?zts6118e	The legend says a Sorcerer placed a statue to Chrysos at the entrance of the underwater cave to protect the clam.zts6119e	Does that mean I can't reach the clam?zts6120e	What I'm trying to say is that you'll need a special element to open the seal. The statue is there to protect the clam from evil creatures. The legend says that the gates will open if you place a Cold Heart, Daisies and Irises into the statue's mouth.zts6121e	Where can I find all that?zts6122e	Hunt down some Ice Fairies, you can get Cold Hearts from them. The Daisies and Irises can be found on the rocky promontories around Rock Cliff, north of Mount Krem. But be careful where you tread up there.zts6123e	Thanks...zts6124e	Wow... it's really high up here!zts6125e	Right, I've got all the Cold Hearts I need. Time to gather the flowers. Back to Rock Cliff...zts6126e	Excellent, I should have everything now. Time to see about that statue...zts6127e	Right then... time we went inside...zts6128e	I should inform Catlotte about this.zts6129e	Have you brought those things I asked you for?zts6130e	Well, something happened...zts6131e	(You explain to Catlotte what happened.)zts6132e	That's a great loss...zts6133e	(You give the flowers to Catlotte.)zts6134e	Korrkoaren sends you these flowers. He said he would return with the pearl soon.zts6135e	Oh... they're so beautiful. I'll find a nice place for them... thank you so much!zts6136e	Sister, can you find a vase for these flowers?zts6137e	Certainly, sister.zts6138e	Oh... we don't have any water to keep these flowers. What should we do? These flowers need water or they're going to wilt!zts6139e	Do you need some kind of special water?zts6140e	Yes, it should be very clean and pure water.zts6141e	Easy! Err... where can I get clean water from?zts6142e	Hmm... what about the water from the well in NosVille? That should be ideal...zts6143e	No, that's no use. That water will only damage the flowers. I'm sorry, we need better water than that.zts6144e	Try the well to the north of NosVille, okay? Please...zts6145e	This is just like the last one... the water's getting more polluted...zts6146e	What about the well water from Sunny Meadows?zts6147e	That's more like poison than water!zts6148e	Wherever you fetch me water from, it isn't good enough. Are you really sure you're getting this water straight from the wells? I thought that was supposed to be drinking water for the people of NosVille...zts6149e	(Hmm... but we'd really have a problem on our hands if everyone is drinking polluted water.)zts6150e	I'm worried about Mimi. Hopefully everything's alright with her...zts6151e	I feel terrible. I can't stop crying. What am I going to do? I look like a right fool, don't I!zts6152e	No, not at all.zts6153e	I'm a fool, crying all the time. Nobody likes me, what am I going to do... *sob*zts6154e	Don't cry, you're not a fool.zts6155e	I recently went for a walk through the Fir and Maple Woods... then... then... *sob, sob*zts6156e	What is it? Tell me what happened.zts6157e	*snivel* There were ugly and slimy lizards there...zts6158e	I was so afraid... *sob* I think I can't stop crying because of them. I wish they were dead. Please, kill the lizards.zts6159e	What, really?zts6160e	(It looks like Mimi will only go on crying if something doesn't happen soon.)zts6161e	Oh I'm still so sad. *sob, sob* Why do I feel so depressed?zts6162e	Maybe it wasn't the lizards after all. *snivel* I need cheering up. *sob* Soraya once told me that she always feels better when she gets all dressed up.zts6163e	Huh? You can't be serious...zts6164e	The Raccoon Birds in the Fir and Maple Woods are such beautiful creatures. Wouldn't it be great to make a hat out of their tails? I think I would feel better if I had a hat like that... *sob*... it'd make me look better... *snivel*zts6165e	(She's getting weirder and weirder...)zts6166e	You know, now I see them, those Raccoon Bird Tails aren't that pretty up close. *sob* Oh, but I'm still so gloomy. Leave me alone... *crying*zts6167e	Hey, come over here.zts6168e	Hey... welcome!zts6169e	Can you understand me? You should clean your ears out! I don't like dirty people...zts6170e	(He's a bit of a weirdo...)zts6171e	What are you mumbling about?  Are your trying it on?  Huh?!zts6172e	Listen here. Soraya recently went on a little walk through Fir Forest. But she was surprised by some Tree Zombies and ended up falling. So sad, don't you think?zts6173e	What's so sad about that?zts6174e	Huh? How dare you say that to my face! Do you want to take me on?!zts6175e	Err... I'm not sure...zts6176e	Hmm... count yourself lucky. I need to pay them back for that... and you're doing to do it for me, understood? Though you're not strong enough to take on Tree Zombies yet. Maybe you should practice on one of those Tree Stumps first. Think you can manage that?zts6177e	I'll try.zts6178e	Try? Where's your conviction?! You don't sound very positive. There'll be no 'trying' here, do you understand me?!zts6179e	Yes!zts6180e	Don't be boastful. This time it's zombies. Off you go!zts6181e	You're not useless as I thought. Now those Wood Zombies are gone, I'll go and pay Soraya a visit... hahaha!zts6182e	Everybody around here is acting very strange. How can I bring them back to their senses? I need to get to the root of this evil...zts6183e	(After thinking about the problem an idea comes and you clap your hands together.)zts6184e	Charlotte said that the water gets more polluted the further upstream you go. There must be something weird going further up the river.zts6185e	Something has gone this way, there are tracks. But what could it be?zts6186e	The tracks lead in this direction... wha-? Those monsters are covering the tracks. I need to be quick so I don't lose track!zts6187e	The tracks lead over here... so where's the water pollution coming from? Do these tracks have anything to do with it?zts6188e	(You here a noise close by.)zts6189e	(The water clears up once the worm has gone.)zts6190e	This water shouldn't be polluted.zts6191e	Let's show this water to Catlotte.zts6192e	The water doesn't smell bad any more. The flowers will thrive on this water. Thank you.zts6193e	By the way, how's Mimi? Is she all right?zts6194e	I'm going to visit her.zts6195e	I am worried. Go on, off you go to NosVille!zts6196e	Hey, how have you been?zts6197e	Are you okay?zts6198e	I'm fine as ever. However... there's something strange. I bumped into some lizards on my way, but they ran as soon as they saw me. That was rather surprising. I didn't especially realise at the time, but I was wearing a hat made of Racoon Bird Tails. Racoon Birds began pecking me all over and I got quite a few scars. Did someone secretly give me that hat?zts6199e	<pname>, I've got a major problem. Soraya sent me a weird letter. I never expected this. Take a look.zts6200e	Dear Calvin, I was impressed that you dealt with the Tree Zombies after hearing my story... I'm pleasantly surprised, I always thought you were just a bookworm... Hehe! In any case, I'll be waiting for you at the agreed location. - Soraya. PS: I can't wait until you propose!zts6201e	(Maybe this story has a happy ending after all...)zts6202e	(Calvin looks like he's in agony.)zts6203e	What am I going to do? I am not ready for Soraya's feelings. I don't remember fighting any Wood Zombies... and where on earth is this 'agreed location' supposed to be?zts6204e	Cheer up!zts6205e	Cheer up?! As if! This is getting too much for me...zts6206e	Act 3 - Unknown Orezts6207e	Hey, I have some good news. Soraya said she might be marrying Calvin. I think that is great.zts6208e	But Calvin looks pretty gloomy... I wonder what's going on?zts6209e	(Mimi had to talk to Calvin.)zts6210e	Ah, I forgot one thing. Here is a new request. Jack Lumber has asked for help.zts6211e	Are you the adventurer from the NosCamp? Welcome!zts6212e	(A young man approaches Jack and whispers something in his ear.)zts6213e	Oh. A few days back I met this guy who said he was looking for something for his boss. Go and talk to him. I'll tell you about my request once you've dealt with him.zts6214e	You must be the adventurer that Jack told me about. My name is Rody Windsinger, it's a pleasure to meet you. What's your name?zts6215e	(He looks fairly stressed out. I should be polite.) My name is <pname>.zts6216e	Oh, that's a good name. Well, I have a small request for you.zts6217e	How can I help you?zts6218e	I am working on a special order which comes right from the top. If you set off right now to fulfil Jack Lumber's task, you'll meet my first officer. Her name is Eri Windspear and she has a massive spear, so don't be tempted into fighting her when you see her.zts6219e	I'll bear that in mind.zts6220e	Thanks, now talk to Jack.zts6221e	All done? Good. Now, listen carefully. I run the lumber mill here in Fir Forest. It's been in my family for generations. Making timber doesn't earn a lot of money, but I can watch those magnificent yaks while I'm working. Sometimes I even hide the graceful creatures from the hunters. But strange things have been happening recently. The yaks have disappeared, and instead I come under attack from some really odd-looking creatures. You need to help me! I want the yaks back. My work is meaningless without those beautiful animals.zts6222e	All the yaks have become violent.zts6223e	What is this bell?zts6224e	(The name 'Jack Lumber' is carved into the bell.)zts6225e	I should ask Jack.zts6226e	(Jack's eyes fill with tears as he holds the bell in his hands.)zts6227e	This is the bell I gave to Merry.zts6228e	Merry?zts6229e	Yeah, one of the female yaks was fond of me. Very fond...zts6230e	Are you saying that these evil creatures used to be normal yaks?zts6231e	I think so... well, adventurer, I need to ask you for a favour.zts6232e	That must be a seriously evil creature that turned the yaks into monsters. Please hunt it down and get rid of it. It's probably hiding away somewhere, but I bet you'll find it if you head deeper into the woods where the evil yaks are. Please...zts6233e	I can hear some weird noises coming from over there. I should check it out.zts6234e	(You tell Jack what happened deep in the forest.)zts6235e	Treekun is the guardian of the forest... I can't believe that he has become a monster. Well, now that Treekun is gone, the deer should return. Thanks! Ah, Rody Windsinger wants to see you. I'd love to know what he asked you the other day.zts6236e	Have you met Eri?zts6237e	(You tell Rody about your meeting with Eri.)zts6238e	I expected it would be very difficult for her, but you helped her. Thank you!zts6239e	You're welcome. Just one more thing. That stone which Eri gave me... what is it made of? I've never seen an ore like it...zts6240e	(Rody Windsinger frowns as if he's seriously deep in thought.)zts6241e	I don't know. If it's a gift from Eri, it won't be anything dangerous.zts6242e	(Rody Windsinger must know something... what's the secret about this ore? I'll find out somehow...)zts6243e	My knight! How have you been? Oh, and how is Mimi?zts6244e	We're both fine, thanks. But I have something to ask you...zts6245e	(You show Catlotte the unknown ore.)zts6246e	I received this ore as a gift. Do you know what it is?zts6247e	I can feel an unfamiliar power. But I don't know exactly... the power in this tiny stone is too weak. I would need more ore to tell you more.zts6248e	Right.zts6249e	Didn't the person who gave you this ore tell you where they got it?zts6250e	Hmm... Someone told me she found it in a tunnel underground.zts6251e	The underground tunnel is to the south-east of Fir Forest. I can't believe that is the source of the ore. We need to learn more details.zts6252e	This must be the place Catlotte mentioned.zts6253e	But I can't see anything like an ore deposit here. Maybe the monsters around here are carrying some.zts6254e	Where can it be...zts6255e	Not here either...zts6256e	Where on earth can I find that stuff...zts6257e	(You suddenly notice something glittering.)zts6258e	I should go back to Catlotte.zts6259e	Act 3 - Fever is a Dangerous Creaturezts6260e	I have examined the ore and discovered that it's composed of elements similar to those of Time-Space Stones. There is an extraordinary amount of energy inside, similar to the energy used to keep Time-Spaces open. However, the energy source is unstable and does not provide a continuous supply. It would be very difficult to refine this ore.zts6261e	Hmm... an ore with secrets. And what do you make of this? I picked it up when I was searching for the ore.zts6262e	(Catlotte screams when she sees the worm mucus.)zts6263e	Yech! Why are you carrying that around with you? Urg... that's so icky. Gross! Get it out of my sight!zts6264e	(Catlotte hides at the back of the room with all her hair on end.)zts6265e	My sister hates worm mucus. And I don't think anyone else we know would have any idea about it. You should try asking someone else.zts6266e	Don't come any closer with that stuff.zts6267e	I should try in NosVille first. Teoman might know something about it.zts6268e	A blacksmith like me wouldn't know about things like that. Don't go bringing stuff like that to me, I'll only crush it with my hammer. You should try asking Calvin.zts6269e	Calvin...zts6270e	(Calvin shakes his head. It doesn't look like he knows anything about it.)zts6271e	First time I've ever seen such a massive dollop of worm mucus. What sort of creature did it come from?zts6272e	Should I ask Soraya?zts6273e	What is that?zts6274e	(Soraya takes a careful look at the mucus.)zts6275e	That's a big lump of worm mucus.zts6276e	(Soraya goes pale and starts to shake.)zts6277e	Get that disgusting thing away from me!zts6278e	Whoa... okay... keep your hair on. Hmm... Eva Energy's over there, maybe I'll ask her.zts6279e	I don't know...zts6280e	(Eva runs into her shop and you hear her screaming inside.)zts6281e	I don't know! I don't know!zts6282e	(No one wants to talk to me. Maybe Mimi knows something.)zts6283e	(Mimi starts to cry when she sees the mucus.)zts6284e	(Is this stuff really so horrible?)zts6285e	I don't know anything about any worms.zts6286e	(Doesn't anyone know anything about this? It seems not.)zts6287e	Maybe Anni can help. She's travelled widely and seen a lot of the world. And Soraya said she would kill you if you bring that mucus to her again.zts6288e	(I guess I've made myself pretty unpopular... Bah... Well, I might as well try asking Anni.)zts6289e	A huge worm? Of course I've never seen anything like that. Where did you meet this so-called worm anyway? I wonder if it would fetch a good price?zts6290e	(I should've known...)zts6291e	Are you showing this thing to everyone you run into?zts6292e	(Anni notices that she's hit a nerve.)zts6293e	Ha! You really have shown it to everybody... great.zts6294e	(Doggo calls you over when he sees the worm mucus.)zts6295e	This mucus... you know, a short while ago, some woman spoke to me. She said she was looking for something really long... it started with 'Fe' I think, but I wasn't able to help her. I told Anni about it and she pumped me full of questions about her. But one thing I can say is that she smelled very similar to this mucus.zts6296e	Do you know where she is now?zts6297e	Yes. She went to the watermill in Maple Woods.zts6298e	Hey sweetie... what brings you to me?zts6299e	(You show the lady the worm mucus.)zts6300e	I came because I think you should know about this.zts6301e	Hm, is that so? That's the mucus of a Phoenix Butterfly Caterpillar, also known as Fever.zts6302e	This Fever of yours has polluted the drinking water in the town. Do you know anything about it?zts6303e	Don't get excited, I'll tell you everything I know. But aren't you going to introduce yourself first?zts6304e	Oh, sorry. My name is <pname>.zts6305e	I am Soty. Soty Bystander. I work for a confused old man...zts6306e	A what? Confused old man?zts6307e	Yeah, that's what I call my boss. But don't worry, you'll probably never have anything to do with him. Anyway, you said you wanted to know about Fever? He's a very dangerous creature. Have you seen what he eats?zts6308e	I've seen that he eats ore.zts6309e	And do you know what kind of ore that is?zts6310e	No.zts6311e	That ore is what the Time-Space Stones are made of. It's loaded with unimaginable power. Fever is eating that ore to store up energy for his metamorphosis.zts6312e	Do you think he'll be a danger to us when he's changed?zts6313e	Like I said, the Time-Space Stones are made of this ore. The energy in these stones can unleash almost divine powers. So just imagine how much energy Fever is storing up. During his metamorphosis that energy is bottled up inside him, but when he hatches it will be released - all at once. What do you think is going to happen when all that bottled up energy gets unleashed at the same time?zts6314e	I don't know.zts6315e	(Soty Bystander utters a loud cry.)zts6316e	BOOM! The explosion will destroy everything far and wide.zts6317e	What? Could it really cause so much damage?zts6318e	Yes. That's why I am collecting as much information as I can about Fever to stop this from happening. I could certainly use your help. I have a long journey behind me and I'm really tired... please say you'll help.zts6319e	I will do anything to prevent the explosion!zts6320e	First find my assistant Rect Lat. He is also looking for Fever. I want you to help him. Can you do that for me? Rect Lat is in Maple Woods at the moment.zts6321e	Soty Bystander asked you to help me? I'm not sure there's much you can do for me.zts6322e	Well, we'll see... I'm Rect Lat.zts6323e	My name is <pname>.zts6324e	I am a bit surprised that you haven't become acquainted with Roofgain... well, never mind. I have something of a favour to ask you. A few days back I found some of Fever's moulted skin, but the Wollets stole it from me. Ideally I'd hunt them down myself, but unfortunately I have more important things to do. I'd like you to do this job for me. It's very important we get that skin back so we can track Fever down.zts6325e	Okay, I'll take care of it!zts6326e	The Wollets I'm looking for are lurking around the outskirts of Maple Woods. But there are other monsters out there too, so be careful.zts6327e	This huge moulted skin must come from Fever. There's something written on the inside... I should show this to Rect Lat.zts6328e	(Rect Lat rounds the strange characters on the inside of the moulted skin.)zts6329e	That's...zts6330e	What does it say?zts6331e	I can't read it.zts6332e	(You sense uncertainty in Rect Lat's voice.)zts6333e	Soty Bystander should know about this. Take it to her.zts6334e	(Rect Lat mutters something under his breath after giving back the moulting.)zts6335e	I thought I knew every language here.zts6336e	(I don't believe him for a second.)zts6337e	(Soty Bystander reads the markings on the moulting.)zts6338e	These characters form a spell, a spell from another world.zts6339e	Huh? Another world?zts6340e	Each one of these characters casts the same spell, but together they only increase the spell's power. If Fever's skin is covered with more characters like this moulting, then the explosion could blow up the entire town and everything around it.zts6341e	I don't believe it!zts6342e	We need to kill Fever before he hatches.zts6343e	But I don't know where he's gone...zts6344e	I know how we can attract him. I can ask Rect Lat to prepare for it, but in the meantime I need you to gather the necessary ingredients. Here's a list of things we'll need.zts6345e	The first ingredient we need is Moth Powder. Fever generally avoids sunlight, which means his eyesight is poor. My plan is to make the Moth Powder look is if it were ore. And Moth Powder is really easy to get hold of.zts6346e	Right, that's enough. Time to get back to Soty Bystander.zts6347e	Did you get enough already? Wow! Then carry on with the next ingredient. The quicker you get all these things, the better it will be for all of us, right?zts6348e	(You read the list.) 'Moth Powder on its own isn't enough to create that glowing effect which will make Fever think he's dealing with real ore. That's why we'll need some Spirit Dust.' But where can I find that? Catlotte will know. She knows a thing or two about things which glow.zts6349e	Spirit Dust? Hm... I've heard of it, but I'm not sure where to get it from... Patty, do you know where to get Spirit Dust from?zts6350e	Didn't you once tell me you'd seen Spirit Dust in Maple Woods? Maybe you can find it in the branches of Maple Devils.zts6351e	Aha! That's right, in Maple Woods... does that help?zts6352e	Yes, thanks!zts6353e	Watch out that you can get stung by the Strong Punkies buzzing around the Maple Devils. Their sting isn't life-threatening, but it's still very painful.zts6354e	You should probably mention that it might be the Strong Punkies you get the Spirit Dust from.zts6355e	Oh, he's gone already.zts6356e	Oh sis...zts6357e	Right, I've got enough of this ingredient. Back to Soty Bystander!zts6358e	Wow! Good work. You're more capable than I thought. Now move on to the next ingredient...zts6359e	(You read over the list.) The third ingredient is required to maintain the illusion of the ore... huh? I need the liver of a Hellhound? Where the hell will I find something like that? Hmm... I know someone who might know... oh dear... and if not, then no one will know. Argh, but I'd rather not ask him again...zts6360e	Well now, what do we have here? <pname>, my very best customer, right? What can I do for you today?zts6361e	I need the liver of a Hellhound.zts6362e	Err... pardon me? I don't think I understood that right.zts6363e	The liver of a Hellhound!zts6364e	Hmm... a Hellhound Liver eh? Good, I can make you a great deal. On that I give you my word. One million gold, that's the price!zts6365e	A fair deal?! Are you kidding me?zts6366e	You're free to go elsewhere if you don't think my offer is fair!zts6367e	That's daylight robbery!zts6368e	(You begrudgingly pay Teodor's price.)zts6369e	Thanks a lot! Hahaha... The evil black dog is lurking somewhere deep inside. Here is a map you might find useful. Come to me any time if you need any help. And don't forget the money, too.zts6370e	They very nearly killed me. Phew...zts6371e	Excellent! Seriously, great job, I am so impressed.zts6372e	So, what's the next ingredient? (You read over the list.) Let's see now... to make sure our fake ore tastes like the real thing, we need to make sure it has a similar texture. Rumbler's Horn should do the trick! Hmm... maybe Mimi will be able to help with that.zts6373e	(You ask about Rumbler's Horn.)zts6374e	Normal Rumbler Horn is pretty tough, but if you're looking for a really strong material, I'd recommend you try the horn of a Rumbler King.zts6375e	Where can I find a Rumbler King?zts6376e	You should find them over on Stone Cliff. You've been there before, so you should remember the way.zts6377e	No problem, but why are you in such a hurry?zts6378e	I will explain everything later. Bye.zts6379e	So busy, as always...zts6380e	Stone Cliff is to the north of Sunny Meadows. Oh, <pname> has already left...zts6381e	Finally! I'm sure Soty will be happy with this Rumbler's Horn.zts6382e	Oh my...zts6383e	What's the matter? Is there something wrong with the ingredients?zts6384e	No, but I was just thinking you're a better worker than Rect Lat. Would you like to become my assistant? I pay a decent wage.zts6385e	I am an adventurer... and an adventurer I shall remain.zts6386e	Too bad. Roofgain would have liked you...zts6387e	Which ingredient should I get next?zts6388e	(You read over the list.) The ore needs to look as if it contains great power. So we should probably add a few Soul Crystals to the mix. Fever is very wary by nature, and he'd never touch the ore if he sensed there were no power within. For our purposes, the Souls of Warriors would be best.zts6389e	I don't understand that... maybe the Koaren Chief can tell me something about these Soul Crystals.zts6390e	Hmm... I'm not sure.zts6391e	(The Koaren Chief discusses the matter with Colly.)zts6392e	Colly says the you can get Soul Crystals from the Souls of Warriors. When they were alive, they were lauded as brave warriors, but now they are just insane monsters. You can find them in the Cave of Ghosts.zts6393e	Now go, my Kang Kang Koaren. And don't forget to bring honour to your people.zts6394e	Wow... the faces of those ghosts were extremely similar to living Kovolts.zts6395e	Are you finished again already? Fantastic! But weren't you afraid? I thought you had to fight some terrifying ghosts.zts6396e	Well, let's just say I was able to handle them.zts6397e	Hmm... my child, someone told me that the soul of a mighty Kovolt warrior is trapped in your tiny human body. Maybe there's some truth to that.zts6398e	No, not in the slightest!zts6399e	I guess I was misinformed... a costly mistake...zts6400e	Who did you get that information from?zts6401e	Hmm... a lady wearing glasses. She said that lots of people pay her that much for her reports...zts6402e	Oh man, Anni...zts6403e	Now we're missing just two final ingredients for the ore. Where did I put the description of the sixth ingredient...zts6404e	Description:Once you have transferred the power in the Soul Crystals to the ore, you need to make sure the ore has the right smell. Golden Maple Leaves are the vital ingredient. Human noses aren't sensitive enough to smell Golden Maple Leaves, which makes it very difficult to find them.zts6405e	Well if humans can't smell the leaves, I'll have to ask Doggo for help. He'll know how to find them.zts6406e	Golden Maple Leaves aren't easy to track down, it's a very subtle smell which soon dissipates. They have a very peaty smell, not even a hint of phellogen.zts6407e	I didn't understand a word of what you just said.zts6408e	It's hard to explain. But basically you should be able to find some Golden Maple Leaves near the Maple Souls. They have a very strong connection to the earth.zts6409e	Maple trees can be found in Maple Woods. But you are more likely to find the Golden Maple Leaves with Maple Souls. Where exactly they might be...zts6410e	Come on, hurry up a bit! Chop, chop!zts6411e	Just one ingredient left. But I should probably give these leaves to Soty Bystander first.zts6412e	How did you get those? Not even Rect Lat could've found this ingredient! I'm seriously impressed with your ingenuity.zts6413e	Riiight... (Who on god's green earth can I ask about the seventh ingredient?)zts6414e	(You hear footsteps behind you and turn around.)zts6415e	Are you looking for something in particular?zts6416e	(Maybe Rody Windsinger knows something about the seventh ingredient for the spell.)zts6417e	(You explain to Rody that you're gathering ingredients for a spell for Soty Bystander.)zts6418e	Oh no... you've been deceived!zts6419e	Deceived?zts6420e	Yes, I'm afraid someone's playing tricks on you. There's nothing dangerous about Fever, it isn't a ticking time bomb, but a harmless animal which is fulfilling a rather important mission. In fact, it is under the protection of Latheore, King of the Angels. They've fooled you into doing their dirty work for them. In reality, they are demons.zts6421e	What?! That's nonsense. I've had a lot of dealings with demons. Those people are humans!zts6422e	Powerful demons can change their looks at will, in comparison to weaker demons. I reckon they have transformed into human form just to deceive you.zts6423e	I don't believe this...zts6424e	I'm not sure what the demons are up to, but I promise you we'll do everything we can to stop their invasion. Our aim is to resurrect Latheore, King of the Angels. Once that's done, the demons can forget about ever again attacking this world. I want you to be at my side when we do this, <pname>.zts6425e	I can't believe what I'm hearing. Who are you?!zts6426e	I am an angel sent from Mystic Heaven. My name is Rudy Steward, one of the King of Angels' eight priests.zts6427e	Why are you hiding your true identity?zts6428e	I didn't have any other choice. My main priority is ensuring the world remains at peace. If you still don't believe me, then ask Eri. She knows all about the demonic spell you're currently preparing. Maybe then you'll understand me...zts6429e	(Rody Windsinger pauses for a second then continues with a firm voice.)zts6430e	Angels only serve justice. Eri will attest to that.zts6431e	Good... then I'm on the side of the angels.zts6432e	(Soty Bystander is delighted when you bring her the final ingredient for the spell.)zts6433e	Thank you! You're a truly first-class NosCamp adventurer. Thanks to your help we'll be able to keep our problem under control. Take the ingredient to Rect Lat. He'll prepare a magic circle to cast the spell from. Do you remember where you first met Rect Lat? He'll be waiting for you there!zts6434e	Act 3 - Where's the Truth?zts6435e	There must be a some kind of misunderstanding.zts6436e	Why didn't you tell me you're a demon?zts6437e	You humans think demons are your greatest enemies. Of course I'm going to hide my true identity from you. And you've only proven why! You were ready to betray me as soon as an angel asked you to. I'm right, aren't I?zts6438e	Weeeell...zts6439e	That's only natural. That is why I didn't tell you who I really am. But now it's time for me to introduce myself properly. I am Recturus Lightelusion, Soty's assistant. Soty Bystander is an agent of the great Surcan, one of the five avatars of Hellord.zts6440e	Then you are my enemy?zts6441e	No, I'm not... Surcan's servants are not hostile to humans. Those who tried to resurrect the Fernon tree were following other masters.zts6442e	But how am I supposed to believe you are not my enemy?zts6443e	What makes you think the angels are on your side? Just because they are angels? Very funny.zts6444e	Look! They have summoned monsters to get rid of both of us. And they told you they just wanted to discover my true identity. Do you really think Fever won't explode when he's completed his metamorphosis?zts6445e	(Rect Lat throws a stone on the ground which looks like the ore Fever eats. When it lands on the ground it produces a loud bang.)zts6446e	Just look at the explosion a tiny stone like that produces. Do you seriously think Fever isn't going to explode? It's chomping through that ore like hay!zts6447e	That was...zts6448e	They want the King of Angels to enter NosVille. But why this town? Doesn't it make you wonder? They could just as easily resurrect him in Mystic Heaven, in their own city.zts6449e	Because there are so many demons here?zts6450e	Wrong. We only came here to stop the angels. Their preparations were already well under way by then. I think they've already tried to resurrect Latheore in Mystic Heaven. But that must've been a major catastrophe for their city. No wonder they looked for another location for the return of the King of Angels. They can save their city and wage war against Hellord at the same time.zts6451e	Are you saying this place is going to turn into a war zone?!zts6452e	Ah, now you begin to understand. I don't want there to be a war, but I'm going to need your help.zts6453e	How can I trust you?zts6454e	Do you know the legend of the first war between Mystic Heaven and Hellord? The goddess Zenas wanted to put an end to everything and erase both Mystic Heaven and Hellord from the face of the universe. But Erenia, the divine mother, managed to stop her. Since then it has been our duty to keep the balance. Hellord has many servants. Some of them want peace... others want war. I want to preserve the peace. If the King of Angels awakes here, the balance of power will be broken, and Erenia will be able to placate Zenas no longer. And then...zts6455e	... the world will be destroyed.zts6456e	(Rect Lat nods.)zts6457e	But I can't trust either you or the angels...zts6458e	I can't force you to believe me. You'll have to carry out your own investigations and discover for yourself who you should trust. Unfortunately we haven't been able to attract Fever. But we have to track him down, whatever we do. He's eaten enough ore now to enter the pupal stage. No doubt he's trying to find himself a quiet place to settle down and make his cocoon. Probably inside an old tree... can you picture where that might be?zts6459e	(Who the hell is telling me the truth? I can't trust the demons or the angels. I'll have to investigate myself and find out who's lying and who's telling the truth.)zts6460e	There's an old tree in the northern area of Maple Woods. It's not difficult to find.zts6461e	This is the place Rect Lat talked about.zts6462e	I never would have expected these underground caves to be so big...zts6463e	Something has gone this way, there are tracks. Looks like the kind of tracks Fever leaves. But I can't see it exactly... the monsters are in the way...zts6464e	The tracks end here. What the... what's making that noise? I need to take a closer look.zts6465e	(While you are trying to hide from the angels, Eri suddenly appears.)zts6466e	What are you doing here? You're injured! Let me see the wound.zts6467e	Don't come any closer!zts6468e	You promised to help us. Then you can also accept help from us.zts6469e	And as a sign of your gratitude for being on your side, you've tried to kill me twice already?zts6470e	I don't know what you are talking about.zts6471e	Don't give me that. The fake spell ingredient you gave me attracted monsters which very nearly killed me! And then when I came here exploring these caves, you attacked me! These wounds are proof that your people attacked me. And I'm supposed to believe that you aren't my enemies?!zts6472e	(Eri drops Slade Oxtern and starts to cry.)zts6473e	I never lied to you. NEVER! And I'd never injure such an upstanding person like yourself. You helped me so often... more than I could ever repay... *sob*zts6474e	Okay, okay... there's no need to cry.zts6475e	Does that mean you believe me?zts6476e	Yes... for the time being.zts6477e	Then let me take care of your wounds.zts6478e	(As Eri places her hands on your wounds, her palms start to glow and your wounds swiftly heal.)zts6479e	I am looking for Fever... do you know where he is?zts6480e	(Eri hesitates.)zts6481e	I need to find out who's telling the truth. So I need to see with my eyes what kind of creature Fever.zts6482e	Something weird is going on here... especially when you say there are lots of other angels here. Rody Windsinger and me are the only angels supposed to be conducting investigations in this region. If there are more angels here, then I need to find out why. Let me join you.zts6483e	Fever's cocoon must be in Seli-Lusha. At least, that's what I heard Rody Windsinger saying.zts6484e	The bridge...zts6485e	It's been destroyed.zts6486e	So what do we do now?zts6487e	(Eri thinks for a moment then claps her hands together.)zts6488e	I think there is an underground path to Seli-Lusha.zts6489e	Really?zts6490e	Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Trust me!zts6491e	Eri... are you really sure this is the right way?zts6492e	Hmm... not absolutely.zts6493e	But you told me you knew where the entrance to the underground path is!zts6494e	Well, I thought it was around here somewhere... but it appears not...zts6495e	Let's take a look around...zts6496e	*sigh* Okay, fine...zts6497e	Hmm... that's strange...zts6498e	The underground path must be over there. But let's get rid of the monsters first.zts6499e	Absolutely!zts6500e	There's nothing here!zts6501e	Huh?! That can't be...zts6502e	Let's try this way.zts6503e	Come on...zts6504e	To be honest, I don't think the entrance is here either.zts6505e	No, this time I'm sure of it. The entrance to the underground path must be just behind these monsters.zts6506e	Sorry...zts6507e	It's not here either...zts6508e	I don't think this is the place.zts6509e	It's pretty unpleasant here, whether or not we're in the right place...zts6510e	Come on now, this time we have to be right!zts6511e	You've said that a hundred times already. I give up...zts6512e	We're slowly getting closer to the entrance, can you sense it?zts6513e	I don't think we're going to get out of here alive.zts6514e	Hey, look over there! There's the entrance!zts6515e	I'm not getting my hopes up.zts6516e	No seriously, there's the entrance! I found it!zts6517e	Well what do you know... the entrance to the underground path!zts6518e	Hah! (Eri grins proud as punch.)zts6519e	Angels are always right.zts6520e	I suppose you were right in one way. It really was 'around here somewhere'.zts6521e	Hehe... sorry about that.zts6522e	Not to worry. At least we made it here safely.zts6523e	We finally made it. Phew...zts6524e	(You hear voices in the distance.)zts6525e	Somebody is coming...zts6526e	This way!zts6527e	Has Korrkoaren found the Pearl of Dusk already? If so, he will have given it to Catlotte.zts6528e	The Pearl of Dusk? No... Korrkoaren and Kenel haven't been here yet.zts6529e	Damnit... I really need the Pearl of Dusk...zts6530e	You need the pearl as well? Then you must want to cast a powerful sealing spell as well, am I right?zts6531e	(You explain to Catlotte what has been happening.)zts6532e	Do you remember? I wanted to use the pearl to seal the Tree of Fernon away forever. Be that is it may... it is probably better if I leave the pearl to you. I'll try to find out where Korrkoaren is hiding.zts6533e	You could do that?zts6534e	Of course! My crystal ball sees everything.zts6535e	(Just as long as the crystal finds the Koarens quicker than Eri found that underground path...)zts6536e	(Catlotte looks deep into her crystal ball and informs you that Kenel and Korrkoaren are still hunting for the pearl deep inside Mount Krem.)zts6537e	How can I get there?zts6538e	I am not sure how to reach Mount Krem. But I think Colly should know his way around there?zts6539e	Welcome! The spirits of the wind told me you were coming. How may I be of assistance?zts6540e	(You tell Colly what Catlotte saw in her crystal ball.)zts6541e	That's not an easy place to reach. On foot it would take you several days to get there, even if you set off immediately.zts6542e	I don't have that much time. I absolutely must find Korrkoaren.zts6543e	By the spirits... maybe it is time to use the spell of the ancients.zts6544e	Spell of the ancients?zts6545e	It's called 'Star & Wind: To Be Near You'. The spell has been kept in my family for generations, and we have never revealed its secret. The spell works in a similar way to a Time-Space Stone, and it uses many of the same elements. I never thought I'd ever have to cast that spell, so I don't have any of them on me. I'll need your help to get them for me.zts6546e	All the ingredients are on this list. Here, take it.zts6547e	What's next?zts6548e	Now I only need one more ingredient.zts6549e	Excellent work! Thank you! I will recite 'Star & Wind: To Be Near You' here immediately. Concentrate...zts6550e	(Colly mumbles the spell.)zts6551e	By the light of the stars and the dance of the wind, flying like a bird with the great rivers twinned. Grant me the power to travel like the spirits.zts6552e	(The spell begins to take effect and the area is filled with a bright light.)zts6553e	(You explain to Korrkoaren why you need the Pearl of Dusk.)zts6554e	I believe in you. Be careful.zts6555e	(I'm going to need help from Eri and Rect Lat to follow through on this.)zts6556e	Act 3 - The Choice of Eri Windspear and Rect Latzts6557e	(You show Eri the Pearl of Dusk and explain how to prevent Fever from hatching.)zts6558e	I need your help!zts6559e	If I were to help you, I'd be a traitor.zts6560e	Don't you think that's unfair?zts6561e	What do you mean unfair?zts6562e	When Latheore, King of the Angels, awakens and enters this world, there will be a massive explosion. My home will be turned into a battlefield between angels and demons. Are you going to just sit there and watch it all happen?zts6563e	No... never... I just...zts6564e	I know that deep down the lives of human beings is important to you, and that you don't want there to be a war. But Rody Windsinger is doing all he can to bring war to our world, a war which will never end!zts6565e	Aside from which, I can't enter into a pact with a demon. They are the living embodiment of Ancelloan's evil thoughts. I simply cannot trust them.zts6566e	You know what's going to happen. When Latheore awakes, all of that energy stored up in the ore will be released at once. I need your help. You know the ore, and you also know Rody Windsinger better than anyone.zts6567e	I believe you are driven by love. I know that you would help every human, that you are against war, and you will try to stop it. Rody Windsinger is obsessed by a hunger for power, and won't stand for anyone's misgivings. Someone needs to stand up to him. I need your help with this. I won't be able to manage it alone. Please help me!zts6568e	(Eri thinks about it for a while before answering.)zts6569e	You're right... we must preserve the balance between good and evil, and protect the lives of the humans.zts6570e	(Now I just need to talk to Rect Lat.)zts6571e	Hmm... are you going to ask Rect Lat for help as well?zts6572e	Of course...zts6573e	But...zts6574e	We will fail without his help. You should put your qualms about him aside.zts6575e	I've been expecting you... you needn't say anything. You want me to help you to prevent Latheore's resurrection.zts6576e	I don't want to return to Hellord. That place is infested by greed and violence. It's an endless fight for survival. I may not believe in Erenia, but the world is still important to me. I wouldn't know what to do with myself if everything here lay in ruins.zts6577e	One things for sure... without life, there would be no point.zts6578e	A typical angel viewpoint.zts6579e	Huh? Are you making fun of me?zts6580e	No, I respect you. <pname>? Do you know where to go now?zts6581e	To Seli-Lusha.zts6582e	Then get a move on... it will not be long now before the metamorphosis is complete and Latheore awakens.zts6583e	(A band of angels appear in the distance...)zts6584e	Don't worry, I will cover your back.zts6585e	Thanks, Rect Lat. Eri, let's go.zts6586e	Be strong, angel! You just turned your back on your own people.zts6587e	I know... and my name is Eri, by the way.zts6588e	Understood... Eri. Right then, let's go!zts6589e	We can't fight against them all. We should try to cut a path through their lines and reach the cocoon.zts6590e	My sisters, have mercy on me... I'm doing this for the humans! Forgive me!zts6591e	It's massive...zts6592e	It's just big enough for Fever. It can't be long now until he hatches...zts6593e	We must stop it... Hurry!zts6594e	Let's go.zts6595e	Stay where you are! Your souls are doomed. May the King of Angels punish you!zts6596e	You're going to go down with your king... you will drown in a sea of emptiness, you hypocrite.zts6597e	The King of Angels will be furious when he awakes.zts6598e	I am not afraid of his anger!zts6599e	We have about half of the journey behind us. Let's go this way!zts6600e	This way leads back to the surface... don't you think we should continue heading down?zts6601e	<pname>, you decide!zts6602e	(You don't hesitate for a second.) To Rect Lat!zts6603e	Haha, very funny...zts6604e	Listen here! I believe your deeds are well intended, but they are wrong. There can never be justification for taking lives. When you kill humans, you also destroy unborn lives. You commit a terrible sin, believe me...zts6605e	Whatever we do, it is always to server Latheore. There's no better justification for our actions. No sacrifice is too great, when it serves his purpose.zts6606e	(An angel sneaks up on Eri Windspear. Just as he is about to attack, Rect Lat smashes him to the ground.)zts6607e	Don't let them distract you, they will only use that to kill you.zts6608e	I know... but...zts6609e	You must be true to your conviction!zts6610e	This time we're on the right path.zts6611e	Really? I'm not so sure this is the right way...zts6612e	We have decided to take this path, so let's go!zts6613e	There are ever more angels trying to stop our progress.zts6614e	Hmm... well if there are that many enemies trying to stop us, then it means we're definitely on the right road. Eri, you take the front, we'll cover your rear.zts6615e	Okay...zts6616e	Next time I'll take the front.zts6617e	Strange...zts6618e	I get the feeling these militias are here as a decoy.zts6619e	Impossible. These are Mystic Knights!zts6620e	What's a Mystic Knight?zts6621e	They're one of the angel army's crack units. Only high-ranking priests can join it. They often appear as Latheore's representatives and fight for the king on the front lines. But if these angels here don't belong to the Mystic Knights...zts6622e	That means...zts6623e	... that we may be walking into a trap.zts6624e	Shouldn't we make sure before we continue?zts6625e	No, we don't have any time for that! We'll find out who we're fighting against, one way or the other.zts6626e	We've reached the cocoon.zts6627e	...zts6628e	What's wrong, Rect Lat?zts6629e	Nothing. Come on!zts6630e	(Something's wrong... why are there no guards here?)zts6631e	(Eri and Rect Lat are bathed in a bright light. You cannot recognise anything.)zts6632e	I couldn't save them, they are lost... ARGHHH!!!zts6633e	Come on... Keep your chin up... you did your best.zts6634e	Don't be upset. It was our own free choice. And only thanks to you was I able to fight for a just cause. For that I am truly grateful!zts6635e	Now it is up to you to continue the fight... we'll be watching you!zts6636e	What are you going to do now?zts6637e	Latheore... we were able to stop his resurrection thanks to the powerful relic from Ancelloan's legacy.zts6638e	And what will happen to you?zts6639e	We will not be able to return.zts6640e	I thank you from the bottom of my heart... now I know that my life had a purpose.zts6641e	My home town is nothing, a place of emptiness. But this place is a veritable river of life. I love this world. And now I've met you, I love it all the more.zts6642e	Adios amigo!zts6643e	Take good care of yourself.zts6644e	No!!zts6645e	(Exhausted, you faint.)zts6646e	Act 3 - Time-Space 64zts6647e	The inside of the Secret Lab is imbued with a dark power. What do I need to investigate there?zts6648e	Are there still more coming?! It's pretty dangerous...zts6649e	I need to tell people about this. I'll paint a picture of this place in my report.zts6650e	(You hesitate for a second.)zts6651e	I am Kang Kang Koaren.zts6652e	(Someone starts giggling. But since it is so quiet, you don't hear them.)zts6653e	So, that's enough investigating. Now I just have to find the exit. There's no way out over there. Which way do I need to go?zts6654e	This place is endless. I think I'm going to lose my mind!zts6655e	(Green smoke appears and envelops your body.)zts6656e	What is that? I am getting sleepy... everything is becoming blurry... but no, I need to stay awake...zts6657e	(Just before you pass out, you notice a big dark shadow appear.)zts6658e	Act 3 - Time-Space 65zts6659e	(You're surrounded by a poisonous cloud. You find it difficult to breathe.)zts6660e	This stinks... I hate this smell. It smells like death itself.zts6661e	Will there be any survivors?zts6662e	I don't think so. No one could have survived this.zts6663e	Hmm... the same poison again. Hold your breath!zts6664e	Does the poison cause people to loose their minds?zts6665e	(Doggo nods.)zts6666e	Mysterious Note:zts6667e	The guardian of the lab waits on the lowest level and will fight off any trespassers. There must be something important down there that they want to protect.zts6668e	Act 3 - Time-Space 66zts6669e	Catlotte, Patty!zts6670e	Wow! My knight... good to see you again. I missed you. Did you miss me too?zts6671e	I came here as soon as I heard you had left the Koaren village. Why did you leave?!zts6672e	Oh, it was terrible. Bad food, no table manners, and a terrible stench. The beds were horrible as well. I just couldn't put up with it any longer.zts6673e	Sister...zts6674e	(Catlotte avoids your gaze.)zts6675e	Could it be that you left because you felt you were feeling guilty? Because you feel responsible that the Fernon tree wasn't completely sealed away?zts6676e	(Catlotte nods timidly.)zts6677e	Catsies are cowards.zts6678e	Kenel, stop that.zts6679e	As you wish, Master.zts6680e	Don't take Kenel the wrong way, young Catsy. But listen: we Kovolts, myself included, are very appreciative of your help. We certainly don't think you are cowards. But we can't afford to let you leave town just because you somehow feel guilty! If you're worried about Fernon, then I suggest we find a way to seal this tree together.zts6681e	Master Korrkoaren...zts6682e	There's something about you which is attracting monsters.zts6683e	(Does she mean Radal's Rings?)zts6684e	We will talk later, after destroying these monsters.zts6685e	Hey, what's this strange power emanating from you? I'd really like to know.zts6686e	(You explain how you got Radal's Rings.)zts6687e	You're always off doing something dangerous.zts6688e	Kang Kang is braver than any other warrior.zts6689e	Huh? Kang Kang?zts6690e	Don't you know that? Well, Kang Kang is...zts6691e	(Your face turning crimson, you interrupt Kenel before he can continue.)zts6692e	Anyway, a lot of people had to lay down their lives. That's why I need your help.zts6693e	(Catlotte scrutinises Radal's Ring very carefully. Then she starts as if she'd just remembered something.)zts6694e	I want to have something called the Pearl of Dusk. If you bring me that, I will help you. Okay?zts6695e	Understood, I'll fetch you your pearl.zts6696e	Act 3 - Time-Space 67zts6697e	Is this where the thousand-year-old clam lives?zts6698e	Yes...zts6699e	There are so many monsters here!zts6700e	The big clam over there looks like it might be the thousand-year-old clam.zts6701e	Thank you. When you released the seal I was able to taste fresh water for the first time in a very long time. I cannot thank you enough. Let me do something for you.zts6702e	Oh, great thousand-year-old clam! We need your Pearl of Dusk.zts6703e	Okay.zts6704e	(The giant clam gently spits out the Pearl of Dusk.)zts6705e	This pearl is my life's work. I hope you will put it to good use. Thanks for freeing me.zts6706e	(Chrysos appears, giggling greedily.) So shiny! Mine. Give it to me...zts6707e	You scoundrel! You'll never get away with this.zts6708e	(Kenel attacks Chrysos but he manages to get away and disappears giggling.)zts6709e	If we fail here, the Catsies will only laugh at me. That would be a disgrace to all the Koaren warriors. Me and my Koaren will retrieve the pearl.zts6710e	I'll come with you.zts6711e	No... you should go and comfort the Catsies. Here, take these flowers as a gift. Now go to them, please...zts6712e	Act 3 - Time-Space 68zts6713e	Argh!!! Wha... what is that?! A worm?zts6714e	(The worm recoils when it sees you and quickly slivers off into the darkness.)zts6715e	I have never seen such big worm. What could that be?zts6716e	Act 3 - Time-Space 69zts6717e	Something is approaching... Look out!zts6718e	Treekun Treekun Treekunzts6719e	That noise... no... what happened to Treekun? Is he responsible for turning the yaks evil?zts6720e	(You receive the Golden Feather after defeating Treekun.)zts6721e	I, err...zts6722e	What?zts6723e	What you have there is very precious to me. I'd like to have it back.zts6724e	Oh sure! Here you go.zts6725e	(You hand over the Golden Feather.)zts6726e	Thank you. Thank you so much! My name is Eri Windspear. Call me Eri... yikes!zts6727e	(Eri trips and falls over.)zts6728e	Ouch! That really hurt...zts6729e	That happens to me from time to time... but don't worry... I'm fine... whoops!zts6730e	(Eri trips again.)zts6731e	(From time to time eh? But that must surely hurt.) By the way, what is that pole over there? It doesn't look like it's anchored down very well.zts6732e	What are you on about? That's my spear, Slade Oxtern! It's a family heirloom. This spear once belonged to my great-great-great-great-...zts6733e	(Eri explains all about his family treasure in nauseating detail.)zts6734e	(That thing's supposed to be a spear? It's way too big to be a spear...) Is it heavy?zts6735e	It felt very heavy the first time I picked it up, but I've got used to it since then. How heavy? Hmm... definitely heavier than that tree.zts6736e	(Eri points to a giant sequoia.)zts6737e	Heavier than a tree? (Eri must be stronger than an ox...)zts6738e	Hmm... Well, I'd like to pay you back for giving me the Golden Feather. Would that be alright with you?zts6739e	(Eri takes a shiny stone from her bag and hands it to you.)zts6740e	I picked this up from the tunnel over there... I understand the people around here like these shiny stones. Please, take it.zts6741e	Thanks, that's very kind of you but... I simply cannot accept.zts6742e	Of course you can. That's the least I can do...zts6743e	(Eri grabs Slade Oxtern and disappears.)zts6744e	Act 3 - Time-Space 70zts6745e	(You discover a large vein of ore.)zts6746e	There it is!zts6747e	(Suddenly the worm reappears and devours the entire lode.)zts6748e	That thing eats ore?zts6749e	(The worm notices and makes a hasty retreat.)zts6750e	Damn... I've lost it...zts6751e	Eri?zts6752e	Who are you?zts6753e	I helped you get the Golden Feather just the other day...zts6754e	Aaah, you're that adventurer. I was so busy that I didn't remember your face... hehe, sorry about that.zts6755e	I've seen some kind of worm...zts6756e	I am on a very important mission right now. We'll have to talk about this some other time.zts6757e	Hey...zts6758e	(Eri quickly vanishes.)zts6759e	(You discover a trail of mucus where the worm slithered away.)zts6760e	Maybe there's some kind of relationship between this worm and the ore...zts6761e	Act 3 - Time-Space 71zts6762e	This place is known to be where Hellhounds seek shelter. Seems quieter than I thought.zts6763e	Are there really any Hellhounds here? Or did I pay good money for nothing?zts6764e	They're all too small...zts6765e	Grrrrr... grrrr...zts6766e	I've found it.zts6767e	Act 3 - Time-Space 72zts6768e	(Eri must be around here. You hear some loud cries and other noises. Definitely someone fighting.)zts6769e	That's a big stick you've got there. Come on! What's wrong? Is your stick all sad? Why is it crying?zts6770e	No one can withstand my Slade Oxtern.zts6771e	Bah, your wily words aren't enough to defeat me.zts6772e	I'm serious. I'm going to destroy your weapon and end this fight.zts6773e	Very funny.zts6774e	(The demon dodges Eri's attack with a simple movement and counterattacks.)zts6775e	Aaahhh!!!zts6776e	(Eri falls to the ground and the demon charges into the attack.)zts6777e	Gotcha! You're not going anywhere!zts6778e	(Something terrible is about to happen!) Stop that!zts6779e	(You intervene between Eri and the demon.)zts6780e	What do you want?zts6781e	I will not allow you attack again!zts6782e	You were asking for it...zts6783e	(The demon runs away.)zts6784e	Stop! Don't run away!zts6785e	Slow down.zts6786e	But I have to stop the demons. They are hindering our sacred duties.zts6787e	But you can't fight with those wounds. You should rest first.zts6788e	But...zts6789e	Seriously, Eri, listen to me.zts6790e	(You treat Eri's wounds.)zts6791e	Why did the demon attack you?zts6792e	I know that you're one of Rody Windsinger's angels.zts6793e	Nobody should know that I'm an angel.zts6794e	Why not?zts6795e	I didn't want to drag you into this war. You're a brave human. You'd probably have volunteered to fight even if I said no.zts6796e	Now that I know everything, I can't sit around and do nothing.zts6797e	There it is.zts6798e	(Eri points at the seventh ingredient for the spell.)zts6799e	You were attacked because of this?zts6800e	Yes. This is one of the ingredients the demons need to attack Fever. They are trying to get rid of Fever, so that Latheore, the King of Angels, cannot be resurrected.zts6801e	Why are you trying to resurrect Latheore?zts6802e	So we can win the war against the demons. I heard you helped to prevent the resurrection of the Fernon tree. It's obvious that the demons want to rule this world. They are constantly provoking wars as an excuse so they can get a foothold. Resurrecting the King of Angels is our only option for putting an end to this war. We must awaken him!zts6803e	I've heard there will be a massive explosion when the King of Angels awakes. Is that true?zts6804e	No, it's not! The King of Angels always emphasised how valuable life is. And I completely agree.zts6805e	(You decide to stand by Eri and tell her about how you started following Soty Bystander's requests to gather ingredients for the spell.)zts6806e	Thank you for telling me the truth. I have an ingredient here, given to me by Rody Windsinger. It looks like the bait which you can use to lure Fever. But it has a completely different effect.zts6807e	A different effect?zts6808e	If a demon were to use this ingredient for a spell, it would reveal their true identity. It will also root them to the spot. Give it to the demons.zts6809e	Act 3 - Time-Space 73zts6810e	Rect Lat, I've brought the last ingredient for the spell. We can get started now.zts6811e	Thanks.zts6812e	(Rect Lat starts to mix together the ingredients to form a magic circle and cast the spell.)zts6813e	Hmm... strange... nothing's happening...zts6814e	How's this possible? Are you sure you brought everything on the list?zts6815e	Weeeell...zts6816e	Are you saying you mixed up the ingredients? Tell me the truth! Now!!zts6817e	(You explain the whole story to Rect Lat.)zts6818e	Damnit! They've been lying to you.zts6819e	No, that's not possible. They are angels. You're a demon!zts6820e	So you think I am your enemy?zts6821e	The demons unsealed the Fernon tree, and started a war between the Kovolts and humans. You plunged everything into chaos.zts6822e	Oh dear... we're going to have to talk about this again. But not until we've dealt with the monsters here. It seems they've got it in for you.zts6823e	You summoned these monsters to get me out of the way, didn't you!zts6824e	I only case the spell using the ingredients which you brought me. I don't have anything to do with these creatures. Watch out that they don't kill you!zts6825e	Act 3 - Time-Space 74zts6826e	The man is still alive?zts6827e	Maybe Eri didn't manage to give the fake ingredient to Rect Lat?zts6828e	What do you mean?zts6829e	You should have died along with the demon. Your presence is a hindrance to our work. But no matter. When Latheore enters this world, he will create order. Though nobody has anything against you dying sooner.zts6830e	So it's true that there will be an explosion when Fever hatches?zts6831e	That is an unavoidable sacrifice we will have to pay. But our aim is to resurrect the great Latheore, King of the Angels. A certain amount of collateral damage is forgiveable.zts6832e	How can you even say something like that? Are you really so callous that you would simply accept the deaths of so many people? But you're angels!zts6833e	Indeed, we act in the interests of all. Your sacrifice is unavoidable, surely you can see that.zts6834e	I will never forgive you for that.zts6835e	Argh... I'm still not sure who is telling the truth. I need to find out the truth... it's so confusing.zts6836e	Act 3 - Time-Space 75zts6837e	This is the path to the interior of Seli-Lusha.zts6838e	Seli-Lusha is astonishingly big!zts6839e	So is Fever.zts6840e	Stop, it doesn't go any further.zts6841e	(When Eri sees the angels, she is surprised.)zts6842e	What brings you to NosVille?zts6843e	Rody Windsinger summoned us here as reinforcements.zts6844e	You belong to the militia. If you're here, then Hellord will also want to strengthen their militia. If that happens, war will become inevitable. Please, go back to Mystic Heaven.zts6845e	The resurrection of the Latheore, the King of Angels, is close at hand. We have been longing for this moment. You too should support Rody Windsinger with you powers, sister.zts6846e	This adventurer here must be allowed to come with me. Rody Windsinger must prove that Latheore's reawakening will not destroy this world.zts6847e	This human is not permitted to enter Seli-Lusha. He's working together with the demons.zts6848e	No, that's not true. He helped us a lot. We need to convince him that we are not his enemy.zts6849e	Eri, pull yourself together. Don't be afraid the changes Latheore's resurrection will bring. Come with us to Seli-Lusha.zts6850e	I... I can't believe this. This world is so beautiful, the blessing of the goddess Erenia is palpable. And so many humans live here... do you really want to destroy all that? All that just to awaken Latheore? Unbelievable.zts6851e	We're doing it for Mystic Heaven. We're doing it to pay back our enemies.zts6852e	You angels... do you really think you can plan for the end of our world so easily?zts6853e	Such an annoying adventurer. I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you now and make sure you don't get in our way.zts6854e	(The leader of the angels gives the order to attack.)zts6855e	You won't be able to escape this one...zts6856e	(The angels start to attack you.)zts6857e	Die!zts6858e	Oh no...zts6859e	(Eri rushes to your aid and blocks the fatal blow with Slade Oxtern.)zts6860e	Eri, you dare to stand against us?zts6861e	This isn't right. You want to kill so many humans, but they do whatever they can to help us. The injustice is unbelievable! Don't do it!zts6862e	Eri Windspear, you are suspended from duty as first officer under Rody Windsinger effective immediately. I will report this to Rody immediately. Soldiers! Kill Eri and her new friend.zts6863e	(Ever more angels appear and the battle looks increasingly dire for you and Eri. But then suddenly, someone appears.)zts6864e	I knew it! Angels love nothing more than fighting.zts6865e	Demons? Eri, have you become so corrupted that you're willing to side with demons now?zts6866e	No! Never!zts6867e	Angels, your hypocrisy is about to end. Die!zts6868e	Kyaaaaaaa...zts6869e	Stop!zts6870e	(Eri attacks Rect Lat.)zts6871e	Hey! These people are trying to kill you! Why are you fighting against me and not them?zts6872e	There must be some kind of misunderstanding. They would never do such a thing.zts6873e	What misunderstanding? These angels were trying to kill you and <pname>. You would be dead by now if I hadn't helped you. Don't you see that?zts6874e	But... but...zts6875e	Face the truth. I'm not your enemy, your own people are.zts6876e	No, you're wrong. You demons are my enemies. You came to Mystic Heaven and killed my family. You...zts6877e	What are you talking about?zts6878e	(Eri disappears without another word.)zts6879e	We have been forbidden from setting foot in Mystic Heaven since the great war...zts6880e	(Rect Lat mumbles then disappears as well.)zts6881e	What was that all about?zts6882e	Hey kid. What are you thinking about? Were you thinking of me?zts6883e	Soty Bystander?zts6884e	What the? That's no way to great someone! I'd much prefer it if you called me 'sweetheart'.zts6885e	Stop playing games with me!zts6886e	Hmm? Fine... where is Rect Lat? He's always running away from me. Roofgain always gets bored when Rect Lat isn't around.zts6887e	Rect Lat fought against Eri Windspear, but now the two of them have disappeared. Meanwhile, I need to find out how I can stop the explosion... but I have no idea where to start. I won't get very far on my own.zts6888e	Oh, I know my way around this place pretty well. Need any help?zts6889e	Would you?zts6890e	Sure. But under one condition. You need to fill in for Rect Lat and spend some time with Roofgain.zts6891e	Who is Roofgain?zts6892e	My whip.zts6893e	Ah, you're still too young... hmm... that was just a joke. Right, let's take a look around the interior of Seli-Lusha.zts6894e	There's Rody Windsinger.zts6895e	That guy...zts6896e	Do you know him?zts6897e	He is scum.zts6898e	I don't like him. Just look at him. We'd never wear clothes like that. And why doesn't he at least change when they get as dirty as they are now?zts6899e	(Rody's coat really does look like it could use a good clean.)zts6900e	Seriously...zts6901e	I can't hear what he's saying... I should get closer.zts6902e	No, wait. If you get any closer, he'll notice you. I'll make sure you can hear him well enough.zts6903e	How much time do we have until Latheore's resurrection?zts6904e	Not much longer now... we're almost finished.zts6905e	Excellent. Oh, do you remember how to prevent his awakening?zts6906e	Of course I remember the spell: 'Screams tear the silence like a chorus of pain. Embrace the void and shy not the rain of blows from the whip. Our souls are lost but we dare not cower. Hellord's codex is my guide; the source of my power.' Just the words alone are enough to give me the shivers. Ah, and it needs the Pearl of Dusk. Otherwise the spell won't work.zts6907e	Exactly right. Does anyone else know this apart from you?zts6908e	No, none that I know of. Rody Windsinger ordered me to keep it to myself.zts6909e	Very good.zts6910e	(Rody Windsinger draws his sword and rams it through the angel's chest.)zts6911e	Aahhhhh... but... wh... why?zts6912e	It's better this way. Remember, there's nothing more honourable than giving your life for the King of the Angels and sacrificing yourself such that he might live again. May Latheore have mercy on your soul.zts6913e	Ro... Rody... you...zts6914e	When you look at Rody, you would never in your life imagine that he is such a terrible monster. We demons would never murder our subjects so out-of-hand like that. And we're supposed to be the bad guys?zts6915e	Rody... did he really just...zts6916e	Now you know how to prevent the resurrection of Latheore, what are you going to do about it?zts6917e	I will prevent it of course. First I need to find the Pearl of Dusk.zts6918e	Do you need any help?zts6919e	Ask me any time you need my help. I will be waiting.zts6920e	Act 3 - Time-Space 76zts6921e	Korrkoaren, I came here to help you.zts6922e	Good that you're here.zts6923e	Our hero Kang Kang Koaren is here! Chrysos is going to get the shock of his life.zts6924e	(I wish they'd leave off with that title...)zts6925e	Prepare yourself, warrior. Chrysos will not be easy, regardless.zts6926e	Act 3 - Time-Space 77zts6927e	Death to the traitors! Keep out of our business, you demons.zts6928e	You're a bigger traitor than the rest of us put together. You are a traitor to your honour and your beliefs.zts6929e	Silence!zts6930e	What is it, angel? Are you scared?zts6931e	We are noble creatures, and powerful to boot. Whatever you might think.zts6932e	Oooh, I'd like to see this. Show me how powerful you are!zts6933e	You uncouth children of Erenia. Prepare to celebrate Latheore's return.zts6934e	To me you aren't angels any more. I'll never forgive you for being willing to sacrifice the lives of so many humans.zts6935e	I too rejoiced to see Latheore's resurrection in the beginning, but I was wrong. This world, that I love so much, will be destroyed should Latheore return.zts6936e	Eri, it's not too late to turn back. Support Rody Windsinger's work and celebration the resurrection of Latheore with us.zts6937e	Never! I once made a promise to treasure and protect all life. I stick to my beliefs.zts6938e	Then you are lost to us. We cannot tolerate that.zts6939e	The angels just keep coming. But we must press on, ever deeper, if we're to stop the resurrection of Latheore. Carry on!zts6940e	Haha... don't you worry. My decision is final. I won't quit now.zts6941e	They can't take everything that is near and dear to me away. Not me! Out of my way, angels!zts6942e	Well. Good job. My team will take care of the rest.zts6943e	Soty Bystander!zts6944e	Thanks for believing in me, honey.zts6945e	Honey?zts6946e	Why so shy? I thought you and me were more than just... now I'm disappointed.zts6947e	Are you serious?zts6948e	Not in the slightest!zts6949e	Soty, you deal with the rest.zts6950e	I'll be back soon. Don't want for me.zts6951e	Hurry! We should keep going.zts6952e	Act 3 - Time-Space 78zts6953e	We're now at the centre of the cocoon. I will recite the spell.zts6954e	Hmm...zts6955e	Is there something you want to say?zts6956e	It's strange that we managed to get this far without meeting Rody Windsinger. Surely he would want to block our path.zts6957e	Maybe he is too busy dealing with my team. You worry too much.zts6958e	I'll recite the spell now.zts6959e	(Rect Lat puts his hand on the pupa and says the magic words:)zts6960e	Screams tear the silence like a chorus of pain. Embrace the void and shy not the rain of blows from the whip. Our souls are lost but we dare not cower. Hellord's codex is my guide; the source of my power.zts6961e	(Rect Lat's body is enveloped by a dark fog and sucked into the pupa.)zts6962e	What's going on?!zts6963e	(As you try to rescue Rect Lat, you hear a noise.)zts6964e	Hahaha! Eri and her adventurer, finally, you have fallen into my trap.zts6965e	Rody Windsinger.zts6966e	Thank you, Eri Windspear. You weren't part of our plan, but I'm surprised by how much more progress we have made with your help. You have my respect.zts6967e	What are you talking about?zts6968e	We were fortunate that this adventurer is so enamoured with you. With your charming innocence, you've managed to wrap that adventurer around you little finger... with fantastic results for us!zts6969e	Are you saying you used me?zts6970e	That's right. The only thing missing for the resurrection was a body. We'd managed to plant Latheore's soul into this cocoon using Ancelloan's legacy, but it was impossible for us to make a body.zts6971e	So this was all part of your plan? You even killed your own subject just to deceive me? You know that I was listening in the distance?zts6972e	How could you kill them?zts6973e	It all has a higher purpose. We couldn't resurrect Latheore without paying a certain price.zts6974e	Are you saying you would stop at nothing to resurrect Latheore? How do you even have the gall to call yourself an angel?zts6975e	I would pay any price to resurrect Latheore.zts6976e	Bah! You were the one who already tried to awaken Latheore. You scum! Didn't you already try to resurrect Latheore in Mystic Heaven?zts6977e	I wonder how a dirty demon like you can know anything about that. But yes, I did. And I learned my lessons from it. There will be no mistakes this time.zts6978e	Then... you're the one who killed my family?zts6979e	Regrettably, yes.zts6980e	I believed in you... I trusted you... Slade Oxtern!zts6981e	(Eri attacks Rody Windsinger, but the latter fights back and injures her badly.)zts6982e	Your services are now superfluous to requirements. Get out of here!zts6983e	Do you expect to stop me with such a pathetic attack as that?zts6984e	I will... get... my revenge.zts6985e	Well, now the demon's body is ready, Latheore's resurrection can begin.zts6986e	(You try to rescue Rect Lat with an accurate strike against the pupa.)zts6987e	I can't let this happen. There must be another way.zts6988e	That's useless, stop it!zts6989e	(Rody Windsinger deals you a powerful blow, knocking you to the ground. You get back up again, however, and return to Rect Lat.)zts6990e	I don't care what you say... I can't just leave my friend here.zts6991e	Run away! It's too dangerous. He is far stronger than you.zts6992e	No, I can't simply run away.zts6993e	(Rody Windsinger attacks again.)zts6994e	Why are you so stubbornly stupid?zts6995e	(Rody Windsinger is winding up to make a final attack, when he is suddenly hit by a black lightning bolt.)zts6996e	Stop, Rody Windsinger. Don't dare to touch that adventurer again!zts6997e	Oh... Soty. I've been expecting you.zts6998e	Shut up! I don't want to talk to you.zts6999e	(Soty Bystander helps you to your feet.)zts7000e	Get some rest. I will finish this. Rect Lat, I have to leave you. Understood?zts7001e	That's okay. Please deal with everything.zts7002e	Soty Bystander, how could you...zts7003e	Latheore's resurrection isn't inevitable. We cannot save Rect Lat any more. Don't look at me like that! We don't have any choice.zts7004e	Is this your treachery, Soty?zts7005e	Treachery?zts7006e	She planned all of this together with me. She even consented to sacrifice her demons, you know? You might not have been following our orders, but we managed to get Rect Lat to do our bidding.zts7007e	Huh? Honestly? I don't believe it.zts7008e	It's true. Over the years, Surcan has become older and more inept. His subjects were becoming restless. They were all afraid there would be a war which would make our territory ever smaller. We need a war to survive. It's time for Surcan to raise his sword once again and join battle with our enemies. We merely need a catalyst, and that will be the resurrection of Latheore.zts7009e	Then you were deceiving even me? Really?zts7010e	Yes.zts7011e	I will never forgive you for that!zts7012e	You won't have to. It's time for you to have a break.zts7013e	(Soty recites the spell and your entire body goes limp. But you don't lose consciousness.)zts7014e	The plan has to be changed. If Rect Lat dies too soon and the power of the pearl fades, that would have bad consequences for Latheore. In the worst case scenario, he could become a second Hellord. That's entirely possible, given that both of them have the same origins: Ancelloan. What are you going to do?zts7015e	I will not let that happen, Soty Bystander.zts7016e	<pname>, you're nothing but an unnecessary burden now. Come on, Roofgain, let's go! Let's smash our enemies.zts7017e	(Every which way I've turned, I've been lied to. Angels, demons... all the same. I'll never forgive them for that. Never!)zts7018e	(Eri approaches you. She is wounded.)zts7019e	They actually used me just to get at you. I'm really sorry. I can release you from this paralysis, but it will take some time. I should manage with the power of my amulet. It was one of the family heirlooms, together with Slade Oxtern. We'll look after you.zts7020e	What are you going to do? Will you...zts7021e	I'm going to stop Latheore's resurrection, with everything I've got!zts7022e	How will you manage that? You're seriously wounded.zts7023e	I'll do my best.zts7024e	Don't do it. Please!zts7025e	(Eri approaches the pupa.)zts7026e	Rect Lat, I am sorry that I suspected you.zts7027e	In the end, you were just a pawn in this game, the same as me. A pawn nobody needs any more.zts7028e	That's not true. We're still needed. We are loved!zts7029e	Perhaps. We mean something to <pname>. At least that's something.zts7030e	I will help you prevent Latheore's resurrection.zts7031e	No! The explosion will kill you.zts7032e	My decision is final.zts7033e	Life spreads, received with songs of praise. Everyone feels the touch of his blessing. His strength will preserve us, and our souls will be healed. I follow Latheore's codex. He shall give me strength for all time.zts7034e	What are you doing? Have you lost your mind, Eri? Stop it! You don't have any right. Latheore will punish you.zts7035e	It can't be that difficult to defeat these evil creatures. Is that part of your great plan?zts7036e	(Eri is sucked into the pupa just like Rect Lat.)zts7037e	(It's not too late. I can still rescue them both. Time to hurry, and woe betide anyone gets in my way!)zts7038e	(As you try to slip into the pupa yourself, two bright lights start to twinkle from your bag.)zts7039e	Huh? Are they Radal's Rings?zts7040e	Are these rings also part of Ancelloan's legacy?zts7041e	Definitely. Part of the King of Angels is trapped inside these rings. Only the Goddess Zenas is powerful enough to create such a device. Where did that adventurer get a treasure like that?!zts7042e	The rings, please, I beg you. Please, help me to rescue Rect Lat and Eri!zts7043e	(Radal's Rings disappear inside the pupa. You notice that something is reacting to the power of the rings. The light from the rings seems to attract something and lock it away inside them. When the light goes out, it becomes clear to you that only one of the most powerful relics from Ancelloan's legacy could possess such extraordinary power.)zts7044e	What... what happened?zts7045e	Level 67 - Everyone's Changingzts7046e	Level 70 - Unknown Orezts7047e	Level 65 - Investigating the Secret Labzts7048e	Catlotte Main Questzts7049e	Level 72 - Is Fever Dangerous?zts7050e	Rect Lat Main Questzts7051e	Level 75 - Where's the Truth?zts7052e	Eri Main Questzts7053e	Level 78 - Eri Windspear and Rect Lat's Choicezts7054e	That place smells like death. I'm not going in there.zts7055e	If you don't, Anni won't leave you alone. There's no other choice.zts7056e	Then I'll have to get ready. You go on ahead.zts7057e	See you on the 2nd floor of the lab.zts7058e	Okay.zts7059e	I've found two strange rings. I'll have to find someone who knows more about them.zts7060e	Can you show them to me?zts7061e	Here you go.zts7062e	(You show Mimi Radal's rings.)zts7063e	Wow! A blue and red ring. Do they belong together?zts7064e	I think so.zts7065e	Soraya loves rare jewellery. I once saw her when she received some rare jewellery, and she was totally over the moon.zts7066e	Hello.zts7067e	Yes? Ah, Catlotte and Catrisha? They were complaining a lot about the Koarens on Mount Krem.zts7068e	They said they needed to find a new place to stay... I think they wanted to go to Fir Forest.zts7069e	No, not necessarily... what I'm saying is... you'll need some special elements to break the seal. According to legend, the gates will open if you place Cold Hearts, Daisies and Irises into the Chrysos Statue's mouth.zts7070e	That's nothing to boast about. Now it's time for the zombies. Off you go!zts7071e	I am healthy as ever... but something's not right.zts7072e	I encountered some lizards on my walk, but they ran away when they saw me.zts7073e	I can't understand why. Aside from which, I was wearing a hat made of Raccoon Bird Tails. I only noticed when some angry Raccoon Birds started pecking at me. I've still got a few little scars.zts7074e	Did someone mix something into my food?zts7075e	Dear Calvin,I was impressed that you dealt with the Tree Zombies after hearing my story...zts7076e	I'm pleasantly surprised, I always thought you were just a bookworm...zts7077e	Hehe! In any case, I'll be waiting for you at the agreed location.Sorayazts7078e	PS: I can't wait until you propose!zts7079e	Hey, I have some good news. Soraya said she might marry Calvin. I think that's great.zts7080e	I am working on a special order which comes right from the top. You will need my help while working on Jack's request. Her name is Eri Windspear and she has a massive spear. Try not to fight when you meet her.zts7081e	Treekun used to be the keeper of the forest... I can't believe he is now a monster. Anyway, now that Treekun is gone, the yaks should come back. Thanks, you did a great job. Ah, Rody Windsinger wants to see you. He also wants to know what went on in the woods.zts7082e	The underground tunnel is to the north of Fir Forest. I can't believe that is the source of the ore. We need to learn more details.zts7083e	Yes... She went to the watermill. In Fir Forest.zts7084e	(You read over the list.) The third ingredient is required to maintain the illusion of the ore... huh? I need the liver of a Hellhound? Where the hell will I find something like that? Hmm... I know someone who might know... oh dear... and if not, then no one will know. Argh, but I'd rather not ask him again...zts7085e	Thank you very much, hahaha. You can find Hellhounds in the very depths of a certain Time-Space. The Time-Space is located in the northern part of Fir Forest. If you need any assistance, you can come back to me at any time. But don't forget your money!zts7086e	I will stand at the front next time.zts7087e	Productionzts7088e	Catrishazts7089e	Exchange Cakeszts7090e	If you bring me 20 Red Mooncakes, I will give you the Red Magical Fairy.zts7091e	Yes, I want to trade.zts7092e	No, I will do it another time.zts7093e	If you bring me 20 Red Mooncakes, I will give you the Red Magical Fairy.zts7094e	Golden Soulstonezts7095e	I am shrouded up in holy light.zts7096e	The warm energy spreads throughout my entire body and has a calming effect on me.zts7097e	Guardian of Light - Questzts7098e	This Soulstone allows you to get an appropriate Specialist Card for your class. Swordsmen can become Crusaders, Archers can become Destroyers, and Mages can become Blue Magicians.zts7099e	Noble personages who sacrificed themselves for the lives of their friends can be found in their eternal sleep here.zts7100e	Stop! Don't move! This is the Land of Death.zts7101e	You are no human.zts7102e	Huh? Of course I'm a human.zts7103e	Then why can I feel demonic energy coming from you?zts7104e	Because I've fought against them.zts7105e	Are the demons returning?zts7106e	That's a problem. In my eyes, you aren't talented enough to stop them if war should break out again.zts7107e	Yes, there is a way.zts7108e	Once, long ago, I defeated the demons together with my comrades. But I no longer have the strength, and I have no way of transferring it to you.zts7109e	My comrades may be able to support you. But since they have already dealt with all their duties, they are no longer here.zts7110e	There is a way. If you collect their valuable mementos, I will show you how you can meet them.zts7111e	The first is Rebecca's Jewelled Belt.zts7112e	The Blue Magician received it from his fiance. During his lifetime it was one of his most treasured possessions.zts7113e	I will give you a note about the belt. You should ask someone who knows a thing or two about jewels.zts7114e	(Soraya looks at the note.)zts7115e	Rebecca's Jewelled Belt... That has a story all of its own.zts7116e	You're in luck; I have it here.zts7117e	However, the jewel in the middle of the belt has been damaged.zts7118e	Apparently it broke all on its own once the owner's fiance died.zts7119e	The jewel is called the Bloodstone. It is a very rare thing indeed. It won't be easy to find a replacement.zts7120e	Tell me more. I'll find one.zts7121e	I understand the monsters on Mount Krem carry similar stones with them. Bring me as many as can. I will then cut them so they fit the belt.zts7122e	Great job! Just a moment, please.zts7123e	(Soraya soon returns with the belt.)zts7124e	It should be fairly similar to the original.zts7125e	But it isn't the original belt, so don't expect too much of it.zts7126e	Fabian treasured it very much. He always had it with him.zts7127e	Fabian?zts7128e	That's the Blue Magician's name. He may appear to be a very cold character, but he has a warm heart.zts7129e	The next thing you need is Piena's Diary.zts7130e	It was a gift from a childhood friend.zts7131e	You will have to ask someone who knows all about books.zts7132e	Do you happen to know of a book called Piena's Diary?zts7133e	Piena's Diary...zts7134e	Hmm... yes, I think I've seen that some place. I think I saw it in Lord Cuarry's library.zts7135e	I should pay a visit to the library then?zts7136e	I've heard it is missing.zts7137e	How come?zts7138e	It disappeared during the war against the Kovolts. The Kovolts must have figured it was valuable.zts7139e	How can I get it back?zts7140e	I can't imagine the Kovolts have it now. After all, they're not interested in books.zts7141e	The diary has some supernatural magical powers. Maybe that comes from the DustDeaths near Mount Krem.zts7142e	As I expected, the pages in here cannot be removed because of the magic. Give me a while. I'll restore it so it looks as good as new.zts7143e	(After a while he hands back the diary.)zts7144e	Here you go.zts7145e	Fabian told me that he returned home every day and read something from the diary.zts7146e	He always said that he didn't have a past. But after reading the diary, he stopped saying that.zts7147e	At least now you have the chance to meet the Blue Magician, Fabian Frost.zts7148e	Say hi for me.zts7149e	When I recovered my senses, I heard a voice.zts7150e	You make a good impression. Fabian likes you too.zts7151e	The next thing I need you to bring me is Ruddy's Handkerchief.zts7152e	It belongs to 'Destroyer'. She treasured it. She received it as a birthday present during her childhood.zts7153e	*You describe Ruddy's Handkerchief to Eva.*zts7154e	Ah yes, I think I've seen that once...zts7155e	(Eva enters, hiding something behind her back.)zts7156e	I can't show the handkerchief to anyone like this... Hehe...zts7157e	I tried to get rid of the stains, but it's still dirty.zts7158e	I think I'll need some Special Bleach to clean it properly. But I can't leave my store... could you bring me some please?zts7159e	I'll tell you what materials I need for the bleach.zts7160e	I need Bean Pods, Straw, Special Water and Flint. The monsters around Mount Krem have them, so they shouldn't be difficult to get. You'll just have to search well.zts7161e	Ah! I also need the recipe for the Special Bleach! Don't forget! Foggy Colossi have the recipe.zts7162e	Here it is. Maybe the recipient will like it.zts7163e	Daisy was a bit of a wild thing.zts7164e	My friends and I called her the 'Destroyer'.zts7165e	Eventually it stuck and became her nickname. She liked it.zts7166e	But when she had that handkerchief in her hands, she turned into a terrific girl. What a marvellous handkerchief that was. Almost as if it were magical.zts7167e	The next thing we need is The Elementary Book of Adventure. It helped her to become a true Destroyer.zts7168e	Dangerous? No, it isn't dangerous. It was a well-known textbook for adventurers in those days. Certainly not as dangerous as you expected.zts7169e	The biggest danger was Daisy herself. Hahaha!zts7170e	Have you heard of The Elementary Book of Adventure?zts7171e	Ooh... If you're after The Elementary Book of Adventure, you can count yourself lucky.zts7172e	I have it.zts7173e	In fact, it's a first edition from by the great adventurer Indicluto. It is very valuable!zts7174e	Would you give me the book?zts7175e	One million gold.zts7176e	What? Excuse me?zts7177e	I will sell it to you for one million gold.zts7178e	Huh? Why is it so expensive?zts7179e	Actually, that's a very fair price. It is worth over 10 million gold. But I'm forced to sell it or I won't be able to pay off my debts this month. *sigh*zts7180e	The iron lady is crying.zts7181e	But it works.zts7182e	Thanks to you, I can pay off my debts.zts7183e	The book is fantastic. Have you read it? I think this is the greatest passage in the book.zts7184e	The ruins are a gift from our ancestors to show us their way of life. We can get in touch with our ancestors through these ruins.zts7185e	Is the aim of your adventure to meet someone?zts7186e	Then it's time you met Daisy the Destroyer. If she doesn't like you, don't give up. She is a warm-hearted person, even if she often grumbles.zts7187e	Phew...zts7188e	Isn't she throwing a bomb at you?zts7189e	Looks like you're having a tough time. Hahaha.zts7190e	The next thing you should look for is the Lucky Stone Necklace.zts7191e	The Crusader treasured it, customarily wearing it when she prayed.zts7192e	Does the name Lucky Stone Necklace mean anything to you?zts7193e	Oh! How did you know to ask me about it?zts7194e	Just a hunch!zts7195e	I have what you're looking for.zts7196e	I inherited the necklace from my ancestors.zts7197e	Apparently it once belonged to a Crusader, back when the angels and demons were at war with each other.zts7198e	But it appears to be broken. I guess the stone lost its powers as time passed.zts7199e	I should pour Holy Water over the necklace to prevent it from deteriorating completely...zts7200e	If you bring me the water, I'll give you the necklace. You can get the water at the end of the Deep Cave.zts7201e	Good work.zts7202e	(As the Holy Water is poured over the stone, the crack in it miraculously disappears.)zts7203e	Fortunately the stone wasn't completely broken. You brought the right water.zts7204e	Do you know the story of the necklace?zts7205e	The Crusader received it from her fianc.zts7206e	Fianc?zts7207e	The Crusader was a woman.zts7208e	At the time, it was very difficult for a woman to become a Crusader. But she even managed to become their leader.zts7209e	She saved many cities from the war and became a national heroine.zts7210e	Amazing.zts7211e	I always found her to be a little heavy-handed, but she was a woman. So I looked after it with care.zts7212e	Anyway, it is time we parted ways.zts7213e	Here, take it.zts7214e	Originally the Lucky Stone was just an ordinary pebble. But through the honesty of her prayers, it transferred into a Lucky Stone. Do you have something you greatly desire to fulfil your dreams?zts7215e	You need to find Justin's Portrait next.zts7216e	It will be easier than the Lucky Stone Necklace.zts7217e	(Justin's Portrait is described.)zts7218e	I'm sorry, but I don't have that portrait any more.zts7219e	I kept the portrait in a small safe. Unfortunately, someone stole the safe and the key.zts7220e	I can't leave here right now, but I know where the key and safe were taken.zts7221e	I will look for them. Just tell me where they are.zts7222e	I learned that the Kovolts bought them first. In turn, the Catsies stole it from them.zts7223e	That's why the Catsies have the key from the Shanera Dungeon.zts7224e	And what about the safe?zts7225e	The safe is small, but it's very heavy, and they couldn't carry it.zts7226e	It's probably being guarded by the Iron Torturers in the Labyrinth of Pain. But they won't be able to get the portrait out if they don't have the right combination.zts7227e	If you bring the safe and key to me, I can open the safe for you and give you the portrait.zts7228e	Here's the portrait.zts7229e	That's...zts7230e	That's the portrait of a Berserker. Are you disappointed?zts7231e	No, not that. I'm not just confused as to why my friend would want it.zts7232e	It is the portrait of the well-known Berserker. He saved many cities during the war between the angels and demons. Back then, many people carried his portrait around with them in an amulet.zts7233e	Even for me it wasn't easy to get the portrait.zts7234e	Can you give me something so valuable just like that?zts7235e	Sure, it's yours. You told me you were looking for it. Now it belongs to you.zts7236e	Bye.zts7237e	Thank you.zts7238e	Crusader Seina didn't want anyone to see the portrait. She was extremely shy.zts7239e	Maybe she believed the Berserker would give her courage.zts7240e	Well, it's time for you to meet Seina, last of the Crusaders. It's up to you whether she accepts you or not.zts7241e	Remember: she'll sense whether or not your intentions are just.zts7242e	How did it go?zts7243e	Fabian, Daisy, and Seina... why did they sacrifice themselves?zts7244e	And all with a smile...zts7245e	How could they smile like that? So soon before their deaths...zts7246e	For love. Because of love. They were able to sacrifice themselves for the people they loved.zts7247e	I don't understand it.zts7248e	You can understand it with your mind, but only with your heart.zts7249e	Congratulation! You passed my comrades' tests.zts7250e	But you must pass one final test before you can get the real power.zts7251e	In this test you must defeat Archtheridon, the mightiest of all Hellord's demons.zts7252e	This test will prove once and for all whether you are strong enough to defeat him.zts7253e	I will use the items you brought me to send you into the past, back to when I fought Archtheridon. I hope you will defeat him.zts7254e	Finally, Archtheridon has been defeated! I've waited for this moment for so long.zts7255e	But the true enemy is another!zts7256e	One day, the true enemy will also have to face up to the judgement of you adventurers.zts7257e	The future looks set to be rough.zts7258e	You have passed all the tests, therefore I will grant all my powers and those of my companions. Use them wisely.zts7259e	Thank you very much.zts7260e	The Guardian of Light - Time-Spacezts7261e	Arghhh...zts7262e	*A sudden cry can be heard in the distance.*zts7263e	Could Fabian be here?zts7264e	Die!zts7265e	Why?zts7266e	Arghhh... Oh, I have such a splitting headache.zts7267e	I must have been mesmerised by a demon!zts7268e	Who the hell are you?zts7269e	Oh, me... I'm just an adventurer passing through. What happened?zts7270e	Demons have attacked this small village. Why, I don't know.zts7271e	I don't know either.zts7272e	I need to ask you something. Would you do me a favour?zts7273e	I am going to go to defeat the leader of the demons who have destroyed this village.zts7274e	And you want me to accompany you?zts7275e	Don't be hasty. No, I want to ask you to do something else. You see, it's like this...zts7276e	Come on, out with it.zts7277e	One of the demons has stolen the diary of a good friend of mine. Please bring it back. The guy was huge, so he should be easy to spot. Please!zts7278e	Here you are.zts7279e	Take it, and this belt too. If a girl comes looking for me, please give her these items.zts7280e	What for? They're the most valuable things you own, Fabian.zts7281e	Ah, so you know my name.zts7282e	I don't have to explain it to you.zts7283e	Just take care of them.zts7284e	What are you going to do?zts7285e	Don't you know that by now?zts7286e	*Many demons approach from a distance.*zts7287e	Get back! Whoever comes close to me will be swept aside by my magic.zts7288e	I have no mercy for fools who play with their food.zts7289e	Huh?!zts7290e	(Daisy suddenly falls over.)zts7291e	Poison...zts7292e	Someone... has poisoned... the food...zts7293e	I need... an antidote...zts7294e	Did you put poison into Daisy's food?zts7295e	Give me the antidote! Quickly!zts7296e	Daisy's been poisoned?zts7297e	Do you have anything to do with it?zts7298e	She is my friend. Why would I do a thing like that?zts7299e	Tell me about her symptoms.zts7300e	(Whitney checks Daisy's symptoms.)zts7301e	We'll need two things to neutralise the poison. I have the first one with me, but the other was stolen by the demons. Here, I'll give you the one I have, but you'll have to get the other from the demons. Only then can you save her.zts7302e	And what are you going to do?zts7303e	I still have something to take care of. I can't see her now...zts7304e	Please don't tell Daisy anything about me.zts7305e	Thanks.zts7306e	Sorry, but I have another favour to ask of you.zts7307e	(Daisy produces a small bag.)zts7308e	Please give this to my father.zts7309e	(The roof of the temple is collapsing.)zts7310e	Please! I should look for my friends now.zts7311e	Who is your father?zts7312e	Stand back, demon!zts7313e	Justin is waiting for me. If I don't leave now, he might die...zts7314e	I'm not a demon.zts7315e	Coward! Don't run away!zts7316e	Ahhh...zts7317e	(Seina falls down holding her head as if she were suffering from a severe headache.)zts7318e	(A demon looks at her from a distance.)zts7319e	(The demon must be using some kind of mind control.)zts7320e	Seina! Are you all right?zts7321e	Yes, I'm fine. I just lost my senses for a moment.zts7322e	But who are you? And how do you know my name?zts7323e	Oh, Justin is in great danger! We should go to him fast.zts7324e	(Seina helps Justin who is about to fall.)zts7325e	You fool... Stubborn like a small child...zts7326e	Seina?zts7327e	(Demons are coming out of the Time-Space.)zts7328e	Get back! I will force them back and enter the Time-Space.zts7329e	You should rest for a while.zts7330e	(Seina sprinkles some sleeping powder over Justin, who slips to the ground.)zts7331e	You...zts7332e	(Seina smiles and gives Justin a kiss.)zts7333e	You must lead a long life for my sake. Promise?zts7334e	Adventurer, I must now enter the Time-Space and force back these demons.zts7335e	Seina!zts7336e	Please take good care of Justin. I'm very grateful for your help, adventurer.zts7337e	Just be careful!zts7338e	Wake up!zts7339e	Fabian! Seina! Daisy! You're safe!zts7340e	What? What do you mean? We've been waiting for you.zts7341e	(You heard a loud voice, which reverberates from the walls.)zts7342e	Destroy them! Echekaruel!zts7343e	What a terrifying creature!zts7344e	The day I recover is the day you die... and the day I destroy NosVille!zts7345e	I swear this by my own name, Archtheridon!zts7346e	Archtheridon?zts7347e	Archtheridon is the strongest of Hellord's demons.zts7348e	That's the reason why the demons were able to bring the war to our world.zts7349e	What's your next step? Are you going to allow these miserable demons to do what they want?zts7350e	Of course not!zts7351e	Hurry.zts7352e	(Archtheridon calls his followers to stop.)zts7353e	You defeated my minions, now you must face me!zts7354e	It was foolish to come here!zts7355e	We cannot stand by and watch you destroy our world!zts7356e	Revenge will be mine! You cannot stop me!zts7357e	This world is full of people who I love. It is my responsibility to save it.zts7358e	In the name of the light, I will destroy you.zts7359e	Aaaaahhhhhhh!!! You pesky worms, you have stopped me getting my revenge... But I will not be so easily defeated. I will return!zts7360e	The fight is over.zts7361e	*kaboom!*zts7362e	Archtheridon's remaining power will explode.zts7363e	What should we do now?zts7364e	We can prevent the explosion.zts7365e	Hurry!zts7366e	There's a problem.zts7367e	What sort of problem? We don't have much time!zts7368e	I can only cast the protective spell over one person.zts7369e	The others will die.zts7370e	Correct.zts7371e	What's there to be worried about?zts7372e	You.zts7373e	Me? I can't do that. Let's try it together.zts7374e	Don't be so stubborn. You've already helped us enough. Only with your help did we get this far.zts7375e	It's decided.zts7376e	We hope you persevere. You are going to play an important part in the battle against the demons in the future.zts7377e	We will be eternally grateful.zts7378e	Please protect this world. It must survive without us.zts7379e	(A mighty explosion can be heard behind the protective shield.)zts7380e	Echekaruel: That's no obstacle for me.zts7381e	Echekaruel: Get lost, Archtheridon!zts7382e	Echekaruel: I remember your rage only too well.zts7383e	Use your reserves.zts7384e	The reserves which you receive for purchasing items in the NosMall can be exchanged. You can exchange 90 points for a gift box which will randomly contain one of eight items.zts7385e	Yes, I want to trade.zts7386e	No, I will do it another time.zts7387e	Dr. W Eventzts7388e	Exchanging Chewing Gumzts7389e	Exchange Airwaveszts7390e	Exchange Airwaves Signzts7391e	Christmaszts7392e	Hohoho! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!zts7393e	If you bring me Christmas Stockings, Falling Stars and Jingle Bells, I'll give you a very special present. Hohoho!zts7394e	Exchange Winter Event Gift Boxzts7395e	Exchange Snowman Raid Sealzts7396e	If you give me 5 Christmas Stockings, 5 Falling Stars and 5 Jingle Bells, I'll give you a Winter Event Gift Box.zts7397e	If fortune smiles upon you, you might get a Santa Bushi as a NosMate.Otherwise you will receive other items. Hohoho!zts7398e	If you give me 8 Christmas Stockings, 8 Falling Stars and 8 Jingle Bells, I'll give you a Snowman Raid Seal.zts7399e	If you win the battle against Huge Snowman, you might just get your hands on something great. Hohoho!zts7455e	I am the butler of the great Lord Cuarry!zts7456e	In his youth, my master was a famed adventurer. I haven't yet met an adventurer who was better than my master!zts7457e	Do you think that you are better than my master?zts7485e	Grey Soulstonezts7486e	Strong, dark power flows from it.zts7487e	I sense anger when I touch it. What does that mean?zts7488e	Dark Avenger - Questzts7489e	This Soulstone allows you to get an appropriate Specialist Card for your class. Swordsmen can become Berserkers, Archers can become Wild Keepers, and Mages can become Dark Gunners.zts7490e	Some bits of the Soulstone are broken.zts7491e	What is it?zts7492e	Someone had destroyed parts of my memory.zts7493e	Who? What for?zts7494e	I don't know. If my memories don't come back...zts7495e	This place might disappear.zts7496e	I can't find my companions...zts7497e	Hey, could you help me?zts7498e	Me?zts7499e	I'll give you a Memory Fragment as an example, and you can hopefully go and find others like it.zts7500e	What brings you here today?zts7501e	(You show the Memory Fragment to Soty Bystander.)zts7502e	Do you know anything about this?zts7503e	That's an interesting artefact.zts7504e	It's a Memory Fragment, isn't it? It contains some very old memories.zts7505e	(When Soty Bystander touches the fragment, it briefly turns purple.)zts7506e	Why did it do that?zts7507e	Maybe it means that you should search for a Violet Memory Fragment?zts7508e	And what about this sample?zts7509e	I think it contains information about the Violet Memory Fragment.zts7510e	Fine. Bring me one these fragments and I'll be able to read the information contained within.zts7511e	There you go.zts7512e	You found that easily.zts7513e	Please wait a moment. I need to transform the Memory Fragment first.zts7514e	(As Soty Bystander touches the Memory Fragment, her hands begin to glow and the fragment turns purple.)zts7515e	Amazing! How did you do that?zts7516e	Oh, it was originally a Memory Fragment. I simply reverted it to its old form.zts7517e	(As you place the Violet Memory Fragment against one of the damaged areas of the Grey Soulstone, it is absorbed in an instant.)zts7518e	I have another question.zts7519e	What sort of memories are contained inside it?zts7520e	It contains the memories of Whitney Catherine.zts7521e	She is a friend of mine and a very capable Dark Gunner...zts7522e	What happened?zts7523e	Curious... I can't remember anything about her.zts7524e	Why not? Is the Violet Memory Fragment incomplete?zts7525e	Oh no! Someone must have damaged it.zts7526e	Adventurer...zts7527e	Use the Memory Fragment to find clues as to who did it.zts7528e	(You explain to the Ancient Soul what happened in the Time-Space.)zts7529e	I see. Then the first clue is clearly 'Angel'.zts7530e	Why did Whitney make a pact with Archtheridon? That wasn't exactly wise.zts7531e	She didn't have any choice.zts7532e	She died of a curse...zts7533e	Anyway, you should find the other fragments.zts7534e	The example Memory Fragment will help you to find the others.zts7535e	Eri, please take a look at this.zts7536e	Hmm... Is that... a Memory Fragment?zts7537e	(When Eri touches the fragment, it turns a shade of green.)zts7538e	I can see something.zts7539e	I will tell you where you need to look.zts7540e	(Eri carefully holds the necklace and the doll in her hands.)zts7541e	(The items transform themselves into a Green Memory Fragment.)zts7542e	This here is the real Green Memory Fragment. I can feel it giving off a warm energy.zts7543e	I am so happy I could help you. Hehe...zts7544e	(When you place the Green Memory Fragment next to the Grey Soulstone, it is absorbed in an instant.)zts7545e	It contains Kupei's memories.zts7546e	Kupei was a very quiet character. But she had a very strong sense of responsibility as a Wild Keeper.zts7547e	I miss her dearly. All those adventures we went on together. It feels like yesterday!zts7548e	Go further back in those memories and you can find other clues.zts7549e	Think you can manage that?zts7550e	Did you find any clues?zts7551e	(You report what happened in the Time-Space.)zts7552e	The King of Angels... it definitely has something to do with angels.zts7553e	What was this 'relic' which Kupei was looking for?zts7554e	That's the item which the King of Angels sealed away.zts7555e	It was part of Ancelloan's legacy, something more powerful than any Time-Space.zts7556e	It's like a ticking time bomb, where nobody knows when it will explode.zts7557e	Why was Kupei looking for something so dangerous?zts7558e	Because she was the guardian of this legacy. It was her duty.zts7559e	The angels, the King of Angels... Slowly, we're getting these clues together. If you find more Memory Fragments, the picture will become clearer. Please find the next Memory Fragment.zts7560e	I want to know about this Memory Fragment.zts7561e	No problem at all. Give it to me?zts7562e	(As soon as Rect's hand touches the fragment, it turns red.)zts7563e	I feel a great hatred and furious anger.zts7564e	And something evil.zts7565e	I know where you must look.zts7566e	(You give Rect the Demon Crystal and Seina's Ring. He hesitates for a moment.)zts7567e	That's the crystal... which can track down a demon... but why?zts7568e	(Rect squeezes the crystal in his hands and crushes it.)zts7569e	Now, that feels better. I had to break the crystal... it makes it easier to make the Memory Fragment.zts7570e	(Rect combines the Demon Crystal and Seina's Ring and creates the Red Memory Fragment.)zts7571e	There we are. You're always bringing me new challenges.zts7572e	But challenges are a good thing!zts7573e	(As soon as you touch the Red Memory Fragment up against the Grey Soulstone, it turns into dust and is absorbed.)zts7574e	It contains Justin's memories.zts7575e	Justin Darkflame. That's the name of a Berserker.zts7576e	There was an incident and Justin was separated from his sweetheart. He searched for her far and wide, but couldn't find her.zts7577e	Sadly he learned too late that she was already dead. He suspected Archtheridon had something to do with her disappearance...zts7578e	He heard Archtheridon had been seen in the company of a young woman and she he pursued them.zts7579e	Him and Whitney?zts7580e	You'll have to find that out from the Memory Fragment yourself. And you're bound to find a few important clues while you're at it.zts7581e	(You report to the Ancient Soul what happened in the Time-Space.)zts7582e	Maybe Justin wasn't after revenge after all.zts7583e	What do you mean by that?zts7584e	He blamed himself for being unable to protect Seina. So he was looking for the place where she died.zts7585e	That's the fate of a Berserker. They simply cannot act rationally.zts7586e	Anyway, the picture is becoming clearer. Now you need to find the final Memory Fragment.zts7587e	(When Rody touches the Memory Fragment, it glows white.)zts7588e	That's...zts7589e	Can you see something?zts7590e	No, nothing.zts7591e	I see...zts7592e	I'm very sorry, but there's nothing I can do... Ask someone else.zts7593e	(Why was the Priest's Spear the only thing to see in this Memory Fragment? Has my plan been rumbled? No, that's not possible.)zts7594e	(When Soty touches the Memory Fragment, it gives off a white light.)zts7595e	Ooh... it's so beautiful!zts7596e	Can you recognise anything?zts7597e	Yes, that's the Priest's Spear. Someone is pointing at it.zts7598e	Where can I get it?zts7599e	From me. I recently bought the design for the Unfinished Priest's Spear from Anni.zts7600e	Okay...zts7601e	It was on offer. It wasn't exactly cheap, but I just couldn't help myself. Honestly, I love buying things when they're on offer.zts7602e	I would sell you the design for the same price. Do you want it?zts7603e	Here you go.zts7604e	With that design, you can make the spear yourself. You just need the necessary materials.zts7605e	Come and see me again after you've made the spear.zts7606e	Wow, you made it! Great work!zts7607e	However, the Priest's Spear should filled with the blessing of an angel... and that's not the case here. I can't transform it into a Memory Fragment without this blessing..zts7608e	How should I do that?zts7609e	Maybe you know someone who looks like an angel?zts7610e	Eri, do you happen to know how to perform an angel's blessing?zts7611e	Err... Why are you asking me?zts7612e	Oh, I dunno. I just thought you might know something about angels. Hehe...zts7613e	Oh right, I see... No, sadly I don't know very much about angels, but I'll do my best to help you.zts7614e	Anyway, what do you need an angel's blessing for?zts7615e	I need it to make a Memory Fragment.zts7616e	It's for the Priest's Spear.zts7617e	A spear? I can't bless a spear. But maybe if the spear were being used, that might work.zts7618e	Let's give it a try.zts7619e	(When Eri touches the Priest's Spear, it gives off a white glow.)zts7620e	Oh, I'm so happy I could help you!zts7621e	Ah! So is it really blessed now?zts7622e	Let me give you a preview of my abilities.zts7623e	(When Eri places her hands on the Priest's Spear, it is bathed in a white glow.)zts7624e	So, there you go! There's the White Memory Fragment.zts7625e	(As soon as the White Memory Fragment touches the Grey Soulstone, it is absorbed in an instant.)zts7626e	As expected, this fragment also contains some of my lost memories.zts7627e	This fragment contains a lot of information, in particular my memories of Echekaruel Mysticaron.zts7628e	Clearly Echekaruel Mysticaron and some angels are responsible for all this.zts7629e	You should be able to use this Memory Fragment to travel back to a point in time where my companions fought against Echekaruel Mysticaron.zts7630e	If you are unable to win the fight, the memories you added will destroy my remaining memories. Please defeat Echekaruel Mysticaron.zts7631e	Can you manage that?zts7632e	I can go now see my comrades again thanks to you.zts7633e	My comrades also send you their gratitude.zts7634e	In return, you will now receive their power. This will help you to protect your own friends.zts7635e	I hope you will never have to suffer a tragedy such as ours.zts7636e	I am really very grateful! You are a true hero! I have faith that you will keep the peace in the future.zts7637e	Dark Avenger - Time-Spacezts7638e	(A girl enters the crumbling passage.)zts7639e	It's too dangerous!zts7640e	Don't try to stop me. Daisy is somewhere around here. I have to rescue her!zts7641e	(The path leading down is blocked.)zts7642e	No! Daisy!zts7643e	You! You're also friends with Daisy. Why did you block my path?!zts7644e	Please find another way. It's too dangerous here.zts7645e	There's no way through here.zts7646e	Do you know where Daisy is? Tell me!zts7647e	Are you a human?zts7648e	Are you a demon?zts7649e	My name is Archtheridon Hellduke.zts7650e	Should we form a pact, human?zts7651e	There's a curse on you which will be fatal... But if you make a pact with me, you'll survive.zts7652e	Do you want to avenge the death of your friend?zts7653e	What do you want from me?zts7654e	Revenge on the angels. Just like you.zts7655e	So will you join me?zts7656e	Yes, okay...zts7657e	Please stop it.zts7658e	I promised that I would survive at any cost.zts7659e	I will avenge Daisy's death.zts7660e	Thanks for your sympathy.zts7661e	Whitney!zts7662e	Stop! Thief! Give the legacy back!zts7663e	Huh? I'm no thief!zts7664e	Then why didn't you say so? I thought you were a thief.zts7665e	Like I said, I'm not.zts7666e	Err... is that a monkey?zts7667e	This is my friend Piepe.zts7668e	I have a favour to ask of you.zts7669e	What is it?zts7670e	Please help me to find the legacy.zts7671e	Curious. The animals around here seem unsettled and... wild.zts7672e	I've never seen them like this before.zts7673e	Our aim is the return of the King of Angels. Don't get in our way!zts7674e	What are you going to do? Hey!zts7675e	Don't run away! Stay there!zts7676e	Don't follow them. It might be a trap!zts7677e	Kupei! Be careful!zts7678e	Dark Avenger - Time-Spacezts7679e	Be careful, Seina's enemy!zts7680e	I will get my revenge.zts7681e	Ohh...zts7682e	Wait a moment.zts7683e	Out of the way! Anyone who tries to stop me will regret it!zts7684e	You cannot stop me! I am invincible!zts7685e	Echekaruel Mysticaron is nearby.zts7686e	Okay... We should get out of here.zts7687e	Damn it! Get lost!zts7688e	Adventurer, I don't have time to toy with you right now.zts7689e	Stop!zts7690e	Echekaruel! Freeze!zts7691e	Are you still alive? Despite your disgrace?zts7692e	You make me sick.zts7693e	Why did Daisy have to die? Tell me!zts7694e	Why are you asking me that? Archtheridon is responsible for her death. Don't get mixed up.zts7695e	You liar.zts7696e	You're the one who made her go looking for Archtheridon. And you're the one who caused the explosion which killed her.zts7697e	You watched it all happen!zts7698e	Meh, I don't have time for this nonsense.zts7699e	Yes, okay. It was me.zts7700e	Haha... Do you think you've seen every dirty trick in the book? Demons know a lot more...zts7701e	Come, my sisters. Deal with them. Make sure they cannot get through to the place where the King of Angels will be resurrected.zts7702e	Stop! Echekaruel!zts7703e	I'll help you. Okay?zts7704e	I will not apologise. As soon as I get my revenge I will put an end to all this.zts7705e	Just one final step, then my revenge will be complete.zts7706e	After all these years I will finally be able to see Seina again.zts7707e	Seina, wait for me. I'll be with you soon...zts7708e	No time to lose. The enemy is here.zts7709e	Justin, how did you get here?zts7710e	How can such a person become a leader? Is everything alright? Arcke?zts7711e	It looks like it. Don't worry.zts7712e	<pname>, it's fine. I'd understand it if you are hungry.zts7713e	Whitney! Kupei! Are you alright?zts7714e	Strange. Did you take a bang to the head?zts7715e	We don't have any time for pain. Is it true that Echekaruel Mysticaron is here?zts7716e	Yes, he's here.zts7717e	What is his game?zts7718e	He's placed two of his followers at the gates...zts7719e	No problem! Anything that gets in my way will be cut down!zts7720e	Echekaruel Mysticaron!zts7721e	You are so tenacious. Why are you so reckless?zts7722e	I lost my dearest because of you! If I cannot avenge her death, I'm not worthy of her love.zts7723e	Watch yourself!zts7724e	You must understand that. She gave me new hope and had to because of your intrigues.zts7725e	You may have treated my friend well, but you must still pay the price.zts7726e	I must fight you for the good of this world. That legacy doesn't exist to fulfil your wishes.zts7727e	We must face him together. Come on!zts7728e	I... I'm the priest... I can't be defeated like this...zts7729e	I can't die like this.zts7730e	Oh, don't worry. You're going straight to hell!zts7731e	You're not the only one.zts7732e	I'll help you.zts7733e	Oh, sorry. It's my fault you've been dragged into this fight.zts7734e	I made my decision when I entered into the pact.zts7735e	My revenge is complete. Then this must be the place when I die...zts7736e	Why haven't you left?zts7737e	Please, deal with this.zts7738e	That's... the legacy!zts7739e	Yes, I leave it to you. Please look after Piepe.zts7740e	What do you mean? Why are you leaving me behind? Why?!zts7741e	We're friends! We will always be together.zts7742e	I've killed so many enemies, and finally I have my revenge.zts7743e	It's time to protect my good friend.zts7744e	As you know, I promised my friend that I would survive at any cost.zts7745e	From now on you will protect this world in my place.zts7746e	I am so happy that I met you. Thank you very much.zts7747e	I will now perform my duties as a Wild Keeper. I'm happy that I could protect you.zts7748e	Don't do it...zts7749e	Don't cry for us! In future you will learn to love life as we did and protect the world from evil.zts7750e	One day, when you have fulfilled your duties, we will meet again...zts7751e	Do you understand?zts7752e	Good bye.zts7753e	(The square explodes with a stupendous burst of light.)zts7755e	Hello <pname>!zts7763e	Have fun in NosTale!zts7764e	This is Mimi Mentor. She'll support you on your adventures.zts7765e	Yes, I'd love to receive a gift.zts7766e	No, I'll pick up the gift later.zts7772e	Refill base SPzts7776e	Yes, I want to collect the gift.zts7779e	Level 80 - Glacernonzts7780e	Act 4 - The Frozen Crownzts7781e	Oh, hello! How are you feeling?zts7782e	*weakly* I've been better...zts7783e	It's time for you to experience new adventures and carry out more difficult missions!zts7784e	Really? I don't think I'm ready for that.zts7785e	<pname>, you don't sound like yourself! You're the pride and joy of NosCamp, <pname>. A real hero! I want you to be happy all the time!zts7786e	I don't know what happened to you, but I want you to cheer up, okay?zts7787e	Oh, wait. I just received a new request. I don't know what it's about, but Anni said she wants you to do something for her, <pname>.zts7788e	I've also got a letter for Anni here. Please deliver it to her.zts7789e	(Anni reads Mimi's letter and mutters something.)zts7790e	Nonsense! Much ado about nothing.zts7791e	Don't mind me. I was just talking to myself.zts7792e	Sorry, Anni... but why did you ask for me?zts7793e	Because there's no one else I can ask.zts7794e	I'm not trying to say you aren't competent. It's just that I don't have anyone else I could ask a favour of at the moment.zts7795e	It's not difficult. Just take my letter to Benito Butler. He could be found in front of Lord Cuarry's estate in Port Alveus. I'm sure you can manage that for me, right?zts7796e	If that's all there is to it...zts7797e	Excellent! Go and do that for me and come back when you've finished!zts7798e	(You see a sorceress standing next to Benito Butler who is desperately trying to ask him something.)zts7799e	Glacernon is a dangerous place. We need help from the adventurers of NosCamp.zts7800e	Didn't I already tell you we'd do everything in our power to help?zts7801e	The date you told me is too late. Benito, we're in a desperate situation here!zts7802e	The adventurers of NosCamp are too busy with their duties in NosVille. We're too far away to help you.zts7803e	Let me talk to Lord Cuarry! I'm certain he will help us.zts7804e	My master is busy at the moment and he left me in charge to deal with matters. You'll have to have a little more patience.zts7805e	Fine. I'll be waiting at the port. Don't forget to let me know.zts7806e	(The sorceress ends the conversation there and walks off towards the harbour.)zts7807e	*mumbling* How many more times do I have to tell her? She really gets on my nerves. Why can't she accept a simple 'No' for an answer?zts7808e	Oh, hello!zts7809e	What do you want?zts7810e	I've got a letter for you here from Anni.zts7811e	She never gives up! Fine, give it here.zts7812e	Hey! Why did you tear it up? You haven't even read it!zts7813e	Because I don't have to read it. I don't know how many times she sent me the same letter.zts7814e	So you're from NosCamp are you? Don't tell me you became an adventurer to run such useless errands for people.zts7815e	(Benito Butler stares at you for a while and then suddenly claps his hands as if he has just had a brilliant idea.)zts7816e	Say! Why don't you go to Glacernon? If you're good enough to be running errands for Anni, she must consider you a fully qualified adventurer. It's good that you came here. That sorceress has been bugging me with her problems for days.zts7817e	(Benito Butler points towards the port.)zts7818e	Go to the port and talk to the sorceress Leika Passage.zts7819e	But I need an answer to that letter...zts7820e	Don't you worry about trivialities like that. Concentrate on more important things. Go to the port at once.zts7821e	So you're the adventurer from NosCamp who was sent to Glacernon, are you? It's a pleasure to meet you. *sigh* I didn't expect you so soon... I don't know what to say.zts7822e	Benito Butler sent me to meet you, Leika. He told me you could use my use.zts7823e	Well that's a surprise! When I talked to him before, it didn't seem like Benito had any intention of helping me.zts7824e	I never expected Benito would send me such a young and brave adventurer. I'm so pleased! He's a really great guy, don't you think?zts7825e	Not so fast! Listen to me for a moment.zts7826e	Oh... err... okay?zts7827e	I'm afraid I'm not as great as you think I am. I'm certainly not as brave as you take me to be.zts7828e	Whatever makes you say that? I can feel the power and energy within you. Why are you so unsure of yourself?zts7829e	Well... I failed to protect my partner... How am I supposed to help anyone else?zts7830e	(Leika Passage looks at you with sorrowful eyes.)zts7831e	You didn't only lose your partner.zts7832e	What do you mean?zts7833e	You lost something far more important. You lost yourself! You're going to have to find yourself, before you can ever help me. Come back and see me again when you're feeling better.zts7834e	(I should go and see Anni first and tell her that Benito Butler tore up her letter.)zts7835e	What happened? Did he read me letter? What did he say? Did he agree to it?zts7836e	He tore the letter to pieces without reading it.zts7837e	Oh! That was the 101st letter I wrote to him.zts7838e	Really? You sent him that many letters?zts7839e	Of course! I always do my best to increase my savings. I don't give up that easily!zts7840e	Why do you try so hard? What for?zts7841e	My conviction is my driving force. I never give up until I've reached my goals. Is it true what I've heard, that you recently lost your partner?zts7842e	How do you know that?zts7843e	That's by the by. So it's true then... That's why you look so sad.zts7844e	Someone asked me to buck you up again. But don't expect me to treat you any better.zts7845e	You can be pretty... direct.zts7846e	Listen to me carefully. You're not the only adventurer who lost their partner. Even I have lost a partner while out on my adventures.zts7847e	But unlike you, I didn't lose heart, didn't lose my way. The experience didn't change me one bit. Don't go thinking I didn't care for my partner. But I have to focus on other things, on other values.zts7848e	As long as I can remember my partner and cherish the time I shared with him, he will live on within me. Do you understand?zts7849e	Your partner must have asked you to do something, right?zts7850e	Then fulfil their wish. That's the way to not lose yourself.zts7851e	No need to thank me. After all, you've done me a favour. If anything, I ought to be thanking you. Hehe...zts7852e	You're welcome.zts7853e	Oh, I almost forgot. Take this to Glacernon. It's letter of recommendation. Show it to Aurelius Roshu. He'll know what to do.zts7854e	Right, I should go and see Leika Passage now. She's waiting for me.zts7855e	I see you have regained your strength.zts7856e	All thanks to you. Now please, tell me how I can help.zts7857e	First you must go to Glacernon to find out the lay of the land there. Prepare yourself well. If you still need to visit anyone, then do it before you set off.zts7858e	I should probably visit Mimi Mentor before heading to Glacernon.zts7859e	Oh, hello! I'm glad to see you're back to your usual self.zts7860e	Now it's time for me to confront new adventures. I'm planning to go to Glacernon.zts7861e	Are you sure? Do you know how dangerous it is there?zts7862e	It won't be easy, but I owe it to my partner. I owe it to them to fight for peace in their stead.zts7863e	You have become a true adventurer indeed!zts7864e	And yet I still have much to learn...zts7865e	Take Latheore's Egg on your journey. You left it here some time ago. It must be important to you, right?zts7866e	Oh yes, I almost forgot. Thank you!zts7867e	Take good care of yourself, <pname>.zts7868e	Don't worry. I'll be back here again soon.zts7869e	It will be a long journey. Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? Before we set off, you should go to Fabian Frost and get the Power of Protection. Only then can we board the ship and set sail. Once we are in Glacernon, I'll give you more instructions.zts7870e	Here we are at last.zts7871e	From here on out, you're on your own. I still have lots to prepare. Take this letter of recommendation to Rudin Albisco, he'll look after you. Come back to me when you want to return to NosVille.zts7872e	(Leika Passage clears her throat and talks to you in a cheerful voice.)zts7873e	Welcome to Frozen Heart Citadel! I hope we meet again soon.zts7874e	(Rudin Albisco reads Leika's Recommendation Letter.)zts7875e	You don't look like much, but this letter suggests otherwise. Interesting...zts7876e	Oh, are you <pname>? It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Rudin Albisco, and I'm a one of the Blue Magicians. It's my responsibility to greet newly arrived adventurers who want to help us.zts7877e	Does that mean there are more adventurers here besides me?zts7878e	That's right. At the moment, we really need all the help we can get.zts7879e	I see. So how can I help you?zts7880e	Well to start you off with I'll give you something easy to deal with. I'll base it on this letter of recommendation. Nothing too dangerous, don't worry.zts7881e	But before any of that, you should go and pay a visit to Aurelius Roshu, Head of the Frozen Heart Citadel. I told him you were coming. He'll be expecting you.zts7882e	(You hear a beast growling at you.)zts7883e	Woah!zts7884e	Don't worry. He's not violent.zts7885e	Come now... I've been expecting you. Welcome to Frozen Heart Citadel! Aah, you've brought the letter I've been waiting for.zts7886e	Hello Aurelius. It's nice to meet you. My name is...zts7887e	<pname>. I know that already.zts7888e	How do you know my name?zts7889e	Oh, that's just one of the little tricks an old wizard like me has up their sleeve. Don't be surprised. What's more important is your decision to help us. It couldn't have been an easy decision. I admire your courage.zts7890e	What's happening in Glacernon? I understand it's something urgent.zts7891e	It's a long story. Listen to me carefully.zts7892e	We originally lived in secrecy right in the heart of Glacernon. But then one day, for some reason, we were driven from that place. It happened so fast that we still don't know how it could happen.zts7893e	I can only assume that some great power was involved, but I can't tell for sure. We built the Frozen Heart Citadel so we could train our forces and eventually recapture our home. But when we marched out from the Frozen Heart Citadel, we encountered more than just evil creatures. A powerful curse was the real threat to us, a curse so powerful that not even our most powerful spells could break it.zts7894e	What sort of curse was it?zts7895e	The curse automatically affects anyone who leaves the citadel, transforming you in an instant into a seal. I managed to absorb some of the energy from this curse and can demonstrate it to you this very moment.zts7896e	(Aurelius Roshu produces a small pouch and sprinkles some magical powder over your head.)zts7897e	Nothing's happening...zts7898e	I can't believe it! You're immune to the curse. What's that shiny item there in your pocket?zts7899e	It's called Latheore's Egg. My partner is sealed inside it.zts7900e	That's amazing! That item protects you from curse. So the prophecy is true! Hahaha...zts7901e	What prophecy?zts7902e	We were locked inside the Frozen Heart Citadel and couldn't do anything. So we tried to see into the future to find a way out. It was prophesied that a young and brave adventurer would come and rescue us.zts7903e	I believe that you are that adventurer... You're here to free us from our prison.zts7904e	Please go to Rudin Albisco. He will tell you what you have to do. He's a very capable Blue Magician, even if he's a little impulsive sometimes...zts7905e	Don't worry. He's not as eccentric as he looks. Go now. You are welcome here in the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts7906e	Aurelius Roshu is a great mage and a remarkable person. He was once my tutor. If it hadn't been for him, the Blue Magicians would have long since disappeared.zts7907e	First, let me tell you what you have to do. At the moment no one is able to leave the citadel because of that curse. You're the only one who can complete this mission, since you're the only one with the powerful object which can counteract the curse.zts7908e	Isn't that pretty irresponsible to send me off on this mission alone?zts7909e	I know and I'm sorry, but I have to ask you for this favour. We need to know what's going on out there. Leave the Frozen Heart Citadel and gather as much information as you can. Let me know if you notice anything suspicious.zts7910e	Did you say you saw penguins?zts7911e	They must be pirates! And that makes this here their logbook.zts7912e	Hmm... according to the logbook, they suffered a shipwreck and are now stranded here. They've been exploring the island trying to find out everything they can. Clearly they're immune to the curse. They've even been as far as the Bitoren Tundra, which is a long way away from the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts7913e	(He continues reading.) What's this? Central barrier stone? What central barrier stone? There must be a reason why we Blue Magicians cannot leave the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts7914e	We need more evidence, <pname>. Meanwhile, I'll evaluate the information you've brought so far. I need to be absolute certain before sending you to Bitoren Tundra.zts7915e	This report was written to inform someone about all our activities. I can't believe someone has been spying on us this whole time. It's hard to believe that stupid creatures are capable of such organisation...zts7916e	It's clear that someone else is behind all this. We don't have any other choice. It's dangerous, but you must go to Bitoren Tundra and have a look around. I think you'll find some valuable information there.zts7917e	It's possible that you'll come across other adventurers while you're there. Since you are unknown to them, it's possible they will attack you, so be on your guard.zts7918e	While Latheore's Egg protects you from the curse, it will cease to function if it's badly damaged. Be careful wherever you go. Good luck.zts7919e	I've read your report on Bitoren Tundra. The centre is heavily guarded, just as I expected. It used to be our home, now it serves as a base for these infernal creatures.zts7920e	The inscription on this tablet is written in an ancient language. How did it wind up here?zts7921e	Unfortunately, I don't really understand this ancient language. Aurelius Roshu is the only one capable of deciphering these writings. Take it to him.zts7922e	Aurelius Roshu takes the tablet carefully and starts to read.)zts7923e	I don't believe it. This is a magic tablet which went missing a long time ago. This inscription is a special protective spell... I bet Mukraju lost it.zts7924e	Who's Mukraju?zts7925e	He was once a highly talented Blue Magician. And he was my friend. Ever since we fled to this place, he disappeared. This tablet used to be in his possession.zts7926e	According to the reports, a very powerful individual must be behind all this.zts7927e	However, we still don't have any decisive evidence. I can't even take a guess. I've heard that the Gnoll Scouts were working for someone else. I want you to go and find out what you can.zts7928e	Lord Morcos?! Are you absolutely sure that's the name they mentioned?zts7929e	But how can it be? I can't believe for a moment that he's involved in this.zts7930e	Who is Lord Morcos?zts7931e	Lord Morcos rules over the Shares Canyon in the western of Glacernon. He's one of the most powerful and stalwart warriors I've ever known. If he's now set his forces against the Frozen Heart Citadel... then we're in big trouble!zts7932e	You must find out whatever you can about who's giving them information about our activities.zts7933e	No, that cannot be! So Mukraju is responsible for our being driven from the centre of Glacernon. It's hard to believe that he has turned and become a necromancer...zts7934e	What kind of mage was he?zts7935e	He was a very powerful mage with a deep and passionate love of magic. But then he became corrupted by someone calling themselves the Master. It makes me so sad to think how that could happen, but when I think of all the Blue Magicians who died because of his treachery, then I feel more angry than remorseful...zts7936e	Thanks to you, we have found a way to combat this great power threatening us. I cannot even begin to tell you how grateful I am. But our fight has only just begun. I'm afraid I'll have to reward you for your efforts later.zts7937e	While you've been off on your adventures, I've been trying to find out something more about Latheore's Egg. I discovered that the egg is mentioned in Mukraju's Magic Book.zts7938e	I left the results of my research with Rudin Albisco, so go talk to him.zts7939e	Hard to imagine your partner could be locked away inside this egg. In order to lock someone away like that, the very nature of their being must coincide with the properties of the object. It would be impossible to lock a human being away inside Latheore's Egg, for instance. That can only that your partner possesses a similar nature to Latheore's Egg itself.zts7940e	My companion is both an angel and a demon.zts7941e	Hmm... that makes sense. I already worked out that your partner would have to be very similar to them.zts7942e	Blue Magicians have been studying magical artefacts for a long time. But we're kind of lost, because we've never conducted an investigation like this before. When it comes to seals and barriers, Mukraju was the best among us. Now he has become a demon who goes around calling himself Lord Mukraju. According to Mukraju's Magic Book here, it's not impossible to break the seal on Latheore's Egg. Not impossible, but not exactly child's play either.zts7943e	That's all I can tell you for now. You'll soon go on a journey to a bigger world. There you'll have opportunity enough to achieve what you want. Just don't give up hope.zts7944e	You've helped us a great deal, and we've done our best to break the seal. I'm sorry we couldn't be of much help to you. We'll keep at it. One day, we'll work out how it works.zts7945e	As soon as we learn anything useful about Latheore's Egg, we'll send word to NosCamp. We remain forever in your debt. Thank you!zts7946e	(Rudin Albisco graciously bids you farewell.)zts7947e	May your every path be blessed, great adventurer.zts7948e	Act 4 - Lord Mukraju's Time-Spacezts7949e	Lord Morcos has a message for Lord Mukraju. Bring it to him.zts7950e	Understood! Lord Mukraju will receive the message. I'll take it to him post-haste.zts7951e	Make sure that no one follows you.zts7952e	I'll set off for Lord Mukraju immediately.zts7953e	You fool! How could you let this pathetic adventurer get the better of you? Why do I bother trying to rely on you idiots?zts7954e	Forgive me, Lord Mukraju!zts7955e	Don't bother me with your pathetic excuses. Make yourself useful and get rid of that adventurer!zts7956e	My master is very angry. It's time I taught you a lesson!zts7957e	What are you trying to achieve with your chaotic powers, your mixture of light and shadow? You powers are not nearly as strong as my master's.zts7958e	This is nothing more than a phantom. Time to return to my master. When the time is right, I'll return.zts7959e	Happy Easterzts7960e	There's something... strange...zts7961e	A very special adventure... eggs... Easter eggs and a soul... Have you found them yet?zts7962e	Simply bring me a White, Red, Yellow and Blue Easter Egg, plus the Soul of Easter. Then I can exchange them for an Egg Fairy. What do you say?zts7963e	Yes, I have them here.zts7964e	Maybe next time.zts7965e	Please bring me the Soul of Easter and 4 Easter Eggs, one each in Red, Blue, Yellow and White... And in return I'll give you an Egg Fairy...zts7972e	Just look at the fairy! Isn't she beautiful? However... Now remember, fairies may be small and cute, but... They are very powerful! Choose your skills wisely!zts7973e	Exchange for Sealzts7974e	Oh my god! The Grasslins are attacking us! Please fight them back!!zts7975e	You require a Grasslin Seal to confront the Grasslins. Bring me three lots of Rice, Chicken Drumsticks and Bamboo, and I'll give you the seal.zts7976e	Please exchange them for the seal!zts7977e	I will bring you the items!zts7978e	Angel and Demon Campszts7979e	This is where the angel and demon teams are found.zts7980e	Pick a team.zts7981e	Time Circle (Port Alveus)zts7982e	Sharing (Family)zts7983e	When you reach job level 20, you can select a profession. But choose carefully. Once you have selected a profession, you cannot change it again.zts7984e	Which profession do you want?zts7985e	Swordsman. I want to be a master of melee combat.zts7986e	Archer. I want to be a quick shot.zts7987e	Mage. I want to dominate the battlefield with magical powers.zts7988e	I think I'll change my profession some other time.zts7989e	A family is a community of NosTale players.zts7990e	A family is a wonderful community where everyone helps each other! It's a great way to enjoy NosTale together with friends.zts7991e	All you need to found a family is a party of three players. One of the three party members should then come to me and pay a fee of 200,000 Gold.zts7992e	However, the family menus aren't completely finished yet, and some features are not available for use.zts7993e	These options will be added in the near future.zts7994e	Benito Butler (Port Alveus)zts7995e	Margaret (Hot Bakery)zts7996e	Hahaha... Come and visit me any time you're hungry. I've always got fresh bread and roast meat to offer.zts7997e	Alice Bellia (Beauty Shop)zts7998e	Welcome to my humble store! Here you can purchase pretty accessories and add options to them as well!zts7999e	What are options?zts8000e	Oh no! Don't you know what options are? Accessories aren't only for making you look good.zts8001e	No no! You can enhance accessories with a whole variety of magical abilities. Isn't that amazing?zts8002e	If you want to equip an accessory with magical abilities, you need a Cellon. These are small gems with magical properties which you can cut from Gillion Stones.zts8003e	Each accessory has a certain number of option slots, as well as a maximum option level. The number of slots determines how many Cellons you can insert, while the level dictates the maximum level of Cellon you can use.zts8004e	Do you understand what options are now? Why not buy an accessory now and try it out!zts8005e	Yes! Thanks for explaining it to me!zts8006e	Noelia Rosa (General Goods)zts8007e	Hello! I have loads of high-quality items for sale! Feel free to take a look around.zts8008e	Marvin Magicus (Alchemist)zts8009e	You look like you want to ask me something. What do you want to know?zts8010e	What is alchemy?zts8011e	What is a Specialist Card upgrade?zts8012e	What are Shells?zts8013e	No, I don't want to ask anything at the moment.zts8014e	Alchemy is used to craft powerful items using various materials.zts8015e	I'm sure you have collected a variety of different materials on your adventures. Don't throw them away just because they look useless. They're bound to come in useful somehow.zts8016e	Just bring the materials to me. I can use them to make all kinds of different potions and other useful items.zts8017e	Thank you! I'll bring you the materials I find on my travels.zts8018e	Just like weapons and armour, Specialist Cards can be upgraded too. Specialist Cards can be upgraded up to level 15.zts8019e	When you successfully upgrade a Specialist Card, it will unlock additional skill points. You'll also receive a pair of beautiful wings when you transform.zts8020e	However, you must be very careful, because Specialist Cards can also lose their souls if the process fails. Specialist Cards which lose their souls can no longer be worn.zts8021e	I've heard that you can restore a Specialist Card's soul using a Soul Revival Stone. These stones are very expensive, however, and only available in the NosMall, so it's best to prevent the soul disappearing in the first place.zts8022e	A shell? That's a clam engraved with a powerful spell.zts8023e	Shells are filled with magical powers which can be transferred to other items. If you manage it, you can unlock really powerful magic items.zts8024e	Of course, the process can also fail. Don't worry, the item won't be damaged should this happen, but you should still be careful, because the Shell will disappear if the process fails.zts8025e	Ahh! I almost forgot the most important thing! Items you've transferred the magical powers of a Shell onto become bound to your soul and cannot be used by other players.zts8026e	Hmm... I'm not absolutely certain. But I have heard that you can buy perfume in the NosMall which you can spray on an item to remove this bond and allow other players to use the item again.zts8027e	Edward (Miniland)zts8028e	I look after your NosMates and ensure that your Miniland is a nice and comfortable place for you to be! Is there anything you need?zts8029e	I have a question about NosMates.zts8030e	I have a question about the Miniland.zts8031e	I'll come back later.zts8032e	Sure, what do you want to know?zts8033e	How can I give an item to my partner?zts8034e	How can I change my NosMate?zts8035e	How can I set my NosMate free?zts8036e	How can I feed my NosMate?zts8037e	How do I use the NosMate Trainer?zts8038e	You can exchange your weapons and armour for items which are exclusively designed for your partner. Use the Partner Equipment function in my shop.zts8039e	After receiving the item, press P to option the character information window. Select a partner and double-click the item you wish to give them.zts8040e	Your NosMates live in your Miniland. You should head over there whenever you want to change your NosMate.zts8041e	Click on the NosMate or Partner you want to take with you and then click on the Accompany button to swap your NosMate for another.zts8042e	If you wish to leave a NosMate who is currently accompanying you in your Miniland, use the button Stay and they will stop following you.zts8043e	Are you sure you want to set your NosMate free? That's a real shame.zts8044e	Think hard about returning your NosMates to the wild. Once released, this action cannot be undone. Purchase a Release Box to set your pet free, or alternatively a Handkerchief of Separation to set your partner free.zts8045e	Select the NosMate in your Miniland which you wish to set free, and then use the Release Box or Handkerchief of Separation. This will release the selected NosMate.zts8046e	You can feed any NosMate which is following you at any time. If you wish to feed your other NosMates, you must first head to your Miniland.zts8047e	Select the NosMate in your Miniland which you want to feed, then double-click the food in your inventory.zts8048e	If your pet's loyalty drops to 0, it will no longer follow you. You should therefore feed your pets as often as possible.zts8049e	Using NosMate Trainers you can increase your pet's attack and defence and thus improve their fighting capabilities.zts8050e	Use the NosMate Trainer in your Miniland where no one will disturb you. Your pet and the trainer will start fighting automatically.zts8051e	Be careful not to attack the NosMate Trainer yourself, however, otherwise they won't have any more influence on your NosMate.zts8052e	How can I share items between my characters?zts8053e	What is the Production Area?zts8054e	Buy a warehouse from me and set it up in your Miniland to share items between your characters.zts8055e	The characters you want to share items between must all own and have a warehouse set up in their Miniland. Please also note that certain items cannot be stored in warehouses.zts8056e	The Production Area can be used to set up minigames which visitors to your Miniland can play.zts8057e	You can receive various materials by topping up your production points in minigames. These materials can be used to craft powerful items.zts8058e	Isaac Artisan (Armour Store)zts8059e	What would you like to know from me?zts8060e	What is a combination?zts8061e	Why don't young people today know even the simplest things? Bah! Right then, I'll try to explain this in simple terms.zts8062e	A 'combination' is the word we use when fusing together several pairs of shoes or gloves to create a new item. What good does that do, you ask? Listen carefully!zts8063e	If you have one defensive item of high quality, and a second one with high resistance, you can combine the two of them together to create an item which fuses both of these positive attributes in one.zts8064e	You can combine up to 6 items at once, but the success rate decreases the more items you fuse together. Be careful, because the items disappear if you fail.zts8065e	Arnold Artisan (Weapon Store)zts8066e	Do you want to ask me something?zts8067e	What's the purpose of upgrading equipment?zts8068e	How does gambling work?zts8069e	Upgrading items? That's easy. You use this process to increase the level of your weapons and armour.zts8070e	Weapons and armour can be upgraded from level +1 to +10. The higher the level, the more useful they become.zts8071e	You won't notice any difference from the appearance, but you will notice that your character becomes more powerful in battle.zts8072e	But you should be careful because the items will disappear if you fail.zts8073e	You still don't know what gambling is? Oh boy. Fine, I'll be kind and explain it to you. You can use the gambling option to drastically increase the rarity level of your weapons and armour.zts8074e	That means you can give a regular everyday item a rarity level. However, there are downsides to this process.zts8075e	Gambling is difficult, and the chances of success are small. The greater an item's rarity level, the higher the chance of failure.zts8076e	If a gambling attempt fails, the items disappears. So don't come crying to me saying I didn't warn you!zts8077e	Leika Passage (Boat to Glacernon)zts8078e	Check Boat Schedulezts8079e	Go to Glacernon.zts8080e	Instructionszts8081e	I'm always grateful to you for helping us. Right now is a good time to travel safely. Do you want to board the ship?zts8082e	Yes, I want to go on board.zts8083e	What do you want to know?zts8084e	Where is this boat headed?zts8085e	When does this boat set sail?zts8086e	How much does the boat ride cost?zts8087e	Why can't I board the ship or go to the island?zts8088e	Why did I end up back in Port Alveus although I left the game in Glacernon?zts8089e	This boat crosses the ocean to reach the fascinating frozen landscape of Glacernon.zts8090e	The island is very dangerous, which is why it is only recommended for players higher than level 60 to make the crossing. It's not only extremely cold in Glacernon, but the creatures there are very powerful.zts8091e	You can board the ship between 5 and 25 as well as 35 and 55 minutes after each full hour.zts8092e	The boat departs every hour on the hour and half past the hour. If you board the boat early, you must wait until the departure time.zts8093e	The crossing fare is 50,000 Gold. Please make sure you have the money before boarding, as you must pay the fare before the boat departs.zts8094e	If you don't have enough gold to pay for the fare when you board the ship, the captain will kick you off.zts8095e	Depending on the status of the Power of Protection, the ship has space for up to 50 people. It's very commendable that you want to travel on this ship, but we must always keep the ship's capacity in mind.zts8096e	Glacernon is cursed by a powerful spell. If too many adventurers go there at once, the spell will teleport you back to this place.zts8097e	That's probably why you cannot board the boat or go to the island.zts8098e	Glacernon is cursed by a powerful spell. If too many adventurers go there at once, the spell will teleport you back to this place.zts8099e	You were teleported back to this place because there were too many adventurers on the island.zts8100e	But don't worry. I'll give you a free crossing this one time.zts8101e	Leika Passage (Boat to Port Alveus)zts8102e	Return to Port Alveuszts8103e	I'm always grateful to you for helping us. Right now is a good time to travel safely. Do you want to board the ship?zts8104e	Fabian Frost (Select a Faction)zts8105e	Obtain the Power of Protectionzts8106e	Instructionszts8107e	Using Latheore's Egg you can obtain the Power of Protection. However, nobody knows whether you will receive the Power of Angels or the Power of Demons. Are you sure you want to obtain the Power of Protection?zts8108e	Yes, I want the Power of Protection.zts8109e	No, I'll come back some other time.zts8110e	What do you want to know?zts8111e	What exactly is the Power of Protection?zts8112e	What do I need to obtain the Power of Protection?zts8113e	How can I be on the same side as my friend?zts8114e	Why did I switch sides after joining a family?zts8115e	Why did my affiliation disappear?zts8116e	The Power of Protection determines whether you are sided with the angels or the demons. The power does not have any effect while you are in NosVille.zts8117e	In Glacernon, however, the two factions form opposing groups and fight one another. There is no cooperation possible between the two sides.zts8118e	That's why players of the same faction have to support one another if they are to survive in Glacernon.zts8119e	You can obtain the Power of Protection at any time. But choose wisely! Once you have chosen the Power of Protection, you cannot alter your allegiance afterwards.zts8120e	If you are the first member of your family to receive the Power of Protection, all other family members receive the same allegiance!zts8121e	Unfortunately, you cannot choose your allegiance freely.zts8122e	All members of a family receive the same allegiance. If your friends belong to the same family as you, you can travel to Glacernon together.zts8123e	If you join a family belonging to the other faction, your allegiance will switch automatically. If the family doesn't have a faction when you join them, then your Power of Protection will disappear.zts8124e	That's why you need to pay attention when choosing your family. Check the family's allegiance carefully before joining them!zts8125e	Did your Power of Protection disappear? That's probably for one of two reasons.zts8126e	One explanation is that you may have joined a family which hasn't yet received the Power of Protection. Your family's affiliation basically takes priority over yours, so your Power of Protection disappears as soon as you join a family without a faction.zts8127e	The other alternative is that Glacernon removed your Power of Protection. The spell over this island gets stronger over time, which may cause faction affiliations to disappear under certain circumstances.zts8128e	Fabian Frost (Frozen Conversation)zts8129e	Ohh... It's so cold here! I wish I could go straight back to Port Alveus and have a nice hot cup of cocoa.zts8130e	Yes, it's freezing.zts8131e	Alfred Erudio (Skill Master)zts8132e	Is there anything you want to know?zts8133e	You can use training to learn a variety of passive skills which permanently increase your skill level.zts8134e	Training isn't free, of course. Once you have selected a profession, you must pay a certain fee. Training is free for Adventurers.zts8135e	You must first reach a certain level to be able to learn specific skills.zts8136e	Training is divided into different levels. You do not necessarily need to have completed the Beginner level to learn a higher level skill.zts8137e	Basic skills are active abilities which you can use in combat. After using a skill, you must wait a certain amount of time before you can use it again.zts8138e	Learning basic skills requires a certain amount of gold and CP. You also have to reach the corresponding job level.zts8139e	Each time your job level increases you receive CP. However you will never have enough CP to unlock and learn every skill. Choose your skills wisely!zts8140e	You can learn up to four different types of plus skill for each basic skill.zts8141e	There is however one restriction, and that being you cannot learn two plus skills bearing the same symbol. These symbols look like squares and circles and can be found in the bottom-right corner of the skills.zts8142e	Skills learned through training cannot be deleted. However, since they don't cost any CP, you don't lose anything either.zts8143e	Hemil Melius (Alchemist)zts8144e	You're as good as dead if you try to leave Frozen Heart Citadel without the necessary preparations. Make sure you get together all the items you need before setting off.zts8145e	Amelia Glacia (Ice Cream Store)zts8146e	Try my amazing ice cream! It's so delicious! Ice cream tastes better when it's cold!zts8147e	Leika Passage (Conversation NPC)zts8148e	Leave Shipzts8149e	What do you want to know?zts8150e	I want to know the current status in Glacernon.zts8151e	I'll come back when I have a question.zts8152e	Glacernon has been thrown into chaos by a powerful curse. War could break out at any time.zts8153e	However, the Blue Magicians are trying to become strong enough to fight this evil power with the help of many adventurers.zts8154e	It's not easy as it sounds, but I don't think it's impossible.zts8155e	Fabian Frost (Conversation NPC)zts8156e	I'm leaving for Glacernon shortly. Is there anything you want to ask me first?zts8157e	Why do I have to fight against players with belonging to the other faction?zts8158e	How can I refill the Power of Protection?zts8159e	What should I do after refilling the Power of Protection?zts8160e	Glacernon has been cursed by two powerful spells. The first transforms anyone without the Power of Protection into a seal. The second assigns you to one of the factions, the light or the dark. You have no choice in the matter.zts8161e	That's why players receive different Powers of Protection. Using the Power of Protection brings with it the specific limitation that players of opposite factions cannot talk to one another. They can only fight.zts8162e	However, you won't damage other players when fighting against them. You simply remove their Power of Protection, which turns them into seals. There's no need to feel guilty when they turn into seals either. The altar in the Frozen Heart Citadel can break this curse and return the Power of Protection to them.zts8163e	Try to collect the different Powers of Protection. Then something will happen to the Central Barrier Tower. But be careful, because the guardian of the Central Barrier Tower might show up.zts8164e	Defeat members of the other faction to receive their Power of Protection. Alternatively you can eliminate monsters which have become immune to the curse.zts8165e	It's a rare occasion, but sometimes a powerful being appears to guard the Central Barrier Tower. His name is Lord Hisrant. He's a warrior from the Behimos Clan, and it's a mystery why he's here.zts8166e	According to Rudin Albisco's investigations, it all goes back to the traitor among the Blue Magicians.zts8167e	Should the Power of Protection of both factions become so powerful that it starts to affect the Central Barrier Tower, the tower's guardian will appear either to the east or the west of the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts8168e	We Blue Magicians have created a Magic Barrier so that the guardian can only attack from a certain direction.zts8169e	If you defeat him, the door to the Central Barrier Tower will open, leading you to the Seal Protector.zts8170e	Aurelius Roshu (Conversation NPC)zts8171e	Welcome, <pname>. I am Aurelius Roshu, leader of the Frozen Heart Citadel. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything.zts8172e	It isn't easy getting used to this cold. But I want you to know that we truly appreciate your help despite these difficulties.zts8173e	There will be many battles ahead. Take care!zts8174e	The Blue Magicians are very grateful and gladly accept your help. I wish you a pleasant stay in the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts8175e	Rudin Albisco (Conversation NPC)zts8176e	Hello <pname>, my name is Rudin Albisco. I'm one of the Great Wizard Aurelius Roshu's students.zts8177e	I'm conducting research into the great power that threatens us. I also give adventurers missions to help me with my investigations.zts8178e	I've heard much about you! Leika Passage is extremely pleased that you've decided to help us. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts8179e	Teleportation Tower (NosVille)zts8180e	Port Alveus (2000 Gold)zts8181e	Teleportation Tower (Koaren)zts8182e	Teleportation Tower (Port Alveus)zts8183e	A shell? That's a clam engraved with a powerful spell.zts8184e	Board Shipzts8186e	Exchange Mooncakeszts8187e	If you bring me 20 Red Mooncakes, I will give you the Red Magical Fairy.zts8188e	Exchange for the Red Magical Fairyzts8189e	I'll do it some other time.zts8190e	Halloween Eventzts8191e	The Halloween festival is here at last! But there's a problem... We don't have enough pumpkins for the party. I'd prepared some ready, but they've been stolen by the monsters.zts8192e	Everyone else is getting ready for the festivities and don't have any time to get them back. But maybe you could help me?zts8193e	Soraya, Eva and myself are organising the party. But please don't mention to them that the pumpkins went missing. I would be a laughing stock! Please bring them back.zts8194e	If you bring me 10 Pumpkins, I'll give you a Halloween Box containing mighty potions, protection scrolls or other handy items. Will you help me?zts8195e	I'll retrieve your Pumpkins.zts8196e	That's not enough. I'll get some more.zts8197e	Please, wait. Do you have time to talk with me? Have you seen any pumpkins lying around by any chance? Monsters stole our supply...zts8198e	Please get them back from the monsters, but don't say anything about it to Malcolm or Soraya. It's my first time organising a festival and I don't want to embarrass myself so soon.zts8199e	If you bring the pumpkins to me first, I'll exchange them for food. You'll be saving my shop from any embarrassment and also keeping my honour intact. Please help!zts8200e	Bring me 10 Pumpkins and I'll give you a Halloween Box containing a health potion or other items.zts8201e	Oh my god! The pumpkins are gone! We need them for the party... Maybe the monsters stole them!zts8202e	Have you collected any Pumpkins while hunting monsters?zts8203e	Malcolm, Eva and myself are organising the festival. If they find out about this, I'll never be able to live it down. And if Calvin hears about it, he'll never trust me with a job like this again! I can't afford to lose his trust. Never!zts8204e	Naturally I'll reward you for your help. If you bring me 10 Pumpkins, I will give a Halloween Box containing Cellons or other cute items. Will you help me?zts8242e	Which profession do you want to learn? Choose wisely! Once decided, you cannot change it.zts8243e	Swordsman. I want to be a master of melee combat.zts8244e	Archer. I want to be a quick shot.zts8245e	Mage. I want to dominate the battlefield with magical powers.zts8246e	Once you reach job level 20, you can choose between one of three classes.zts8247e	After choosing your class, you gain access to a variety of powerful skills. If you do not choose a class, you will find it hard to continue after level 20 as a regular Adventurer.zts8248e	After choosing a class, you can no longer use your Adventurer's equipment. You should therefore remove all your equipped gear before making your choice.zts8249e	Instead, we will give you equipment that you can use at your level. It isn't the greatest, but it will be useful to you on your adventures after choosing your new class.zts8250e	After choosing your class, you will automatically receive the Power of Protection.zts8251e	What is the Power of Protection?zts8252e	The Power of Protection is the energy of the angels or demons. Some adventures are only possible once you have this power.zts8253e	The Power of Protection will not change you in any way, it is more like a form of permission.zts8256e	Do you want to change your profession and receive the Power of Protection?zts8257e	Yes, I want to change my profession.zts8258e	No, I'll come back some other time.zts8261e	I understand.zts8398e	So long!zts8577e	The crossing is free and will take you to Port Alveus. Do you want to board the ship?zts8729e	Please hurry.zts8911e	Who's there?!zts9274e	Thank you so much!zts9424e	Why?zts9618e	What happened?zts9625e	I don't have the time.zts9719e	Thank you!zts9847e	Oh, so that's how it is.zts10164e	So that's how it is...zts10245e	Are you sure?zts10761e	What's that?zts11291e	What do you mean?zts11632e	Thank you very much.zts12195e	Who are you?zts12654e	Yes? What happened?zts12746e	Greetings. Is there a problem?zts12767e	Conversation with Santa Clauszts12768e	Merry Christmas! I am very busy this year, so I'm looking for someone who can lend me a hand. Would you like to help me?zts12769e	Help to get the Christmas presents ready.zts12770e	Hunt evil Rudolphs.zts12771e	Help with Daily Preparationszts12772e	End Dialoguezts12773e	In order to give the children their gifts, I need stockings. But some evil monsters have stolen all the children's stockings! Could you retrieve them from the monsters?zts12774e	If you bring me 10 Christmas Stockings, I'll give you a Little Gift Box containing a Cake or a Christmas Costume (1 Day).zts12775e	Exchange Christmas Stockingszts12776e	Try again next time.zts12777e	Rudolph has been acting very strange lately. He doesn't listen to what I tell him and he refuses to pull the sleigh. If it goes on like this, I'll never be able to bring the children their presents.zts12778e	I've heard some Ugly Rudolphs have appeared recently. I think they're having a bad influence on my Rudolph. Someone needs to deal with them and rescue my Rudolph from them.zts12779e	You can find the monsters by starting the Instant Combat. Please eliminate the monsters, especially Ugly Rudolphs and Wicked Snowmen. If you kill all the monsters in there, my Rudolph will return to normal.zts12780e	Please bring me Rudolph's Antlers as proof. If you bring me 3 Antlers, I'll give you a Big Gift Box containing a Cake, a Christmas Decoration or a Christmas Costume (7 Days).zts12781e	Exchange Reindeer Antlerszts12782e	There's still much that needs doing to prepare all the presents! Do you think you could help me?zts12783e	You need to do a little job for once a day, like hunting monsters to protect the children.zts12784e	You'll receive a Christmas Voucher for your help. Once you've collected 6 or 12 of them, you can exchange them for a gift.zts12785e	If you bring 6 Christmas vouchers, I will give you a big gift box including a cake, Christmas jewellery, or Santa costume(7days). If you bring 12 vouchers, I will give you a special gift box including Santa costume(30days).zts12786e	Accept Questzts12787e	Exchange Christmas Voucherszts12788e	Receive a Gift Box next time.zts12789e	You can get to the monsters via the Instant Combat. Hunt down Ugly Rudolphs and Wicked Snowmen. Once you've eliminated all the monsters, my Rudolph will go back to normal.zts12790e	Santa Claus Quest Final Dialoguezts12791e	Thank you for your help. As a reward for your efforts, let me give you a tasty cake, vouchers, and a firework.zts12792e	The island's magical forces are too strong at the moment, preventing you from travelling to Glacernon.zts12793e	The ship can only depart once the magical forces ebb. Would you like to come back later?zts12794e	The island is gripped by an icy cold and beset with powerful monsters. I would only recommend travellers venture to the island if they are at least level 30.zts12795e	You can sail to Glacernon once the island's magical forces have subsided.zts12796e	The ship departs every 5 minutes. If you board the ship before departure time, you will have to wait until the ship is ready to leave.zts12797e	The fare is 3,000 gold. Please check that you have enough gold. You must pay the fare before the ship sets sail.zts12798e	But don't worry, the first journey is free.zts12799e	The island's magical forces are subsiding, and you can now travel to Glacernon without danger. Do you want to board the ship?zts12800e	You can now take the ship to Glacernon!zts12801e	Oh, the ship departs every 5 minutes. However, if you embark before the departure time, you'll have to wait on board until the ship is ready to sail.zts12802e	New Year's Eventzts12803e	If you want to learn more about the Power of Protection, please go and visit Fabian Frost in Port Alveus. Alternatively, press F12 to read about it in the guide.zts12804e	The family created will receive a fresh Power of Protection. Family members will always fight together in the same faction, so they can go on adventures together.zts12805e	However, certain functions aren't quite finished yet, which is why certain family features and interfaces are currently unavailable.zts12806e	Happy New Year! Have you already made some resolutions for 2009?zts12807e	Excuse me, but could you help me please? I'm busy making some greetings cards for the New Year using magic letters, but I can't make any more because my letters have been stolen by some wicked creatures.zts12808e	Could you bring me any letters you loot when hunting monsters? I need the letters to spell 'New Year' or 'Happy New Year'.zts12809e	Where can I find the letters?zts12810e	Exchange 'Happy New Year'zts12811e	Exchange 'New Year'zts12812e	There are two types of letters. There are golden letters H, A, P and Y, and white letters N, E, W, Y, A and R.zts12813e	When you hunt down a Bull Bushtail, which occasionally appears in the fields, you can get one of the golden letters H, A, P, Y, or a Rice Cake Soup.zts12814e	The white letters N, E and W can be received from any creature, while the letters Y, A and R can only be looted from monsters in the Instant Combat.zts12815e	Okay, I understand.zts12816e	Bring me the golden letters to spell the word HAPPY and the white letters spelling the words NEW YEAR, and I will give you Happy New Year Golden Box.zts12817e	Open the box and you can get a traditional costume (30 days), a random item or a Bull Bushtail.zts12818e	I've collected all the letters for 'Happy New Year'!zts12819e	Goodbye.zts12820e	I will give you Happy New Year Box if you bring me all the white letters of the alphabet which spell the words NEW YEAR.zts12821e	Open the box and you can get a traditional costume (7 days), random items, a Lucky Charm or some Rice Cake Soup.zts12822e	I've collected the letters for 'New Year'!zts12823e	The ship departs every 5 minutes. You can board the ship early, but you will have to wait on the ship until the appointed departure time.zts12824e	Fabian Frostzts12825e	If you change your class or join a family, you will receive the Power of Protection.zts12826e	If you purchase an egg from me, you can get the Power of Protection or change your current one.zts12827e	Join a friend's family or use the egg I sell to change your faction.zts12828e	When you join a family, you will belong to that family's faction.zts12829e	So make sure you check which faction the family belongs to before joining them!zts12830e	When there are lots of players in Glacernon, both faction's Power of Protection gradually increases.zts12831e	The Power of Protection is increased when more players are present, but when only a few players are present, the Power of Protection cannot be maintained.zts12832e	Should the Power of Protection of both factions become so powerful that it starts to affect the Central Barrier Tower, the tower's guardian will appear either to the east or the west of the Frozen Heart Citadel.zts12833e	Only players who are members of a family can enter the raid. You can obtain various treasures from the raid by hunting the powerful monsters there.zts12834e	If you change your faction, your battle record and contribution points will be reset. So be careful!zts12835e	Also, if you purchase and use an egg, you can change your Power of Protection or receive a new one.zts12836e	Open the Happy New Year Golden Box to receive a very special item.zts12837e	When you open a Happy New Year Box, you can get a Lucky Charm or some Rice Cake Soup.zts12838e	When you found a family, you will lose your faction allegiance. Purchase an egg from Fabian Frost to select a new faction.zts14243e	You require a Grasslin Seal to confront the Grasslins. Bring me three lots of Rice, Chicken Drumsticks and Bamboo, plus 20,000 gold, and I'll give you a seal.zts14244e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Spirits of Aster Courtyardzts14245e	And? I think there's a spirit in the Underground Caves that's much more powerful than the one at the library.zts14246e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Attack on the Harbourzts14247e	Did you notice anything unusual on your way here?zts14248e	(Tom raises his hand and points towards the desert.)zts14249e	There it is, Mortaz Harbour. Unfortunately it's been partially destroyed by the monsters' attack. Funny thing is, not long ago, the monsters never bothered attacking the harbour.zts14250e	We can't stand around and do nothing! Go and deal with the monsters at the harbour so they can no longer attack it.zts14251e	And? Did anything happen?zts14252e	Ah, okay, so it's the prickly pears then. Thanks, we can certainly consider this the first successful step.zts14253e	You're not aware of prickly pears? They're something of a speciality in the Mortaz Desert. You've probably seen them being traded before, but you don't see them in the shops of late.zts14254e	You're right, it is odd. They say the lost bag of prickly pears is lying at the entrance to the harbour.zts14255e	Please slay some more monsters and gather more information. Maybe we can find out more.zts14256e	Have you brought any proof?zts14257e	Unknown creatures were hanging around near the monsters? I just don't understand it!zts14258e	It must have been those scoundrels: the Desert Robbers! I'm sure this is their doing. Take care of the Desert Robbers first and then find the evidence. If you find the prickly pears, bring them straight to me.zts14259e	You need to teach them a serious lesson!zts14260e	Were you able to find the Prickly Pears?zts14261e	I knew the Desert Robbers were behind the whole thing! Thanks for your help. Why don't you take a break now? You look exhausted.zts14262e	There aren't enough forces at Mortaz Desert Harbour to beat the Desert Robbers.zts14263e	That's why I need to ask for your help. If you leave here and head northwards, you'll find an outpost. That's Neil's Camp. Take this letter and deliver it to Hamid, who's hiding in the nearby area.zts14264e	He'll give you further instructions.zts14265e	And you are? I don't believe we've ever met, have we?zts14266e	Ah, so Harbour Guard Tom sent you! Then let me see the letter you've brought.zts14267e	(Hamid reads the letter carefully and nods.)zts14268e	As you already know, Mortaz Desert Harbour is constantly being attacked and besieged by Desert Robbers. We need to try to dissuade them from attacking the harbour again.zts14269e	Deal with the Desert Robbers around Neil's Camp first. I'll give you further instructions after that.zts14270e	How did it go? What's with the Desert Robbers?zts14271e	Excellent work! But we can't assume we've wiped out all of the attackers on the harbour. Harbour Guard Tom's words ring only too well in my ears.zts14272e	They say that hunters on the prowl for larger prey don't leave anything to chance or fortune. They always have a plan ready.zts14273e	While you were busy in Neil's Camp, I received good news. It's about Commander Neil... it seems he received an order a few days ago to storm the harbour.zts14274e	In order to stop this, you'll have to go to Neil's Camp and take out Commander Neil before he has chance to carry out his mission. After that, steal the written orders.zts14275e	But don't bring it back to me, but straight to Harbour Guard Tom.zts14276e	Have you got something for me?zts14277e	(Harbour Guard Tom reads the written orders and grins.)zts14278e	Thanks a lot! I'm going to reward you generously.zts14279e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Strange Happeningszts14280e	The Desert Robbers have been manipulating the creatures, using them to attack the harbour with them. We need to put a stop to that.zts14281e	Eliminate all the Desert Robber patrols you find around Neil's Camp. Afterwards go to Assistant Hamid and follow his instructions.zts14282e	It looks like Lighthouse Guard Chilton sent you. Please wait a moment. I have some more jobs for you.zts14283e	(Hamid rifles through his pockets looking for something in particular.)zts14284e	This is a report discovered by another adventurer. It contains important information on the Desert Robbers. If the contents are telling the truth... well, you're going to have to find that out yourself. Take it with you and prepare a similar report after you've taken care of the Desert Robbers.zts14285e	Have you brought the search party's report?zts14286e	Excellent! This is quite a detailed report! Now we can compare the information in the two reports.zts14287e	(Hamid reads the report with a serious look on his face.)zts14288e	Now we know how we need to proceed.zts14289e	Neil only set up his camp here to be able to block Mortaz Desert Harbour. We'll have to prepare a surprise attack and make sure we don't end up drawing the short straw. Get some reinforcements and deal with the Desert Robbers!zts14290e	What happened at Neil's Camp? Were you able to take them all out?zts14291e	We were able to delay the Desert Robbers' plans a bit, but the job isn't done yet. We still have a long road ahead of us.zts14292e	I have read through the report carefully and thought it over. I still need more information to get to the bottom of the Desert Robbers' plans. Track down Commander Neil in his camp and get me the information I need.zts14293e	Did you deal with Commander Neil? I need his quality search party report. Please hurry, time means lives.zts14294e	Give me the report!zts14295e	(Hamid excitedly reads through the second report and makes a very unsatisfied face.)zts14296e	We have to come up with a plan immediately to combat the Desert Robbers!zts14297e	We must inform all of the harbour's residents as soon as possible!zts14298e	Bring the information we've gathered over to Lighthouse Guard Chilton at once.zts14299e	We don't have much time! Please hurry!zts14300e	Have you got something for me?zts14301e	That must be the report I've been waiting for. It contains important information which I asked Hamid for before his departure. Thanks a lot!zts14302e	The Akamur Camp is an important crossroads between the harbour and Desert Eagle City. We cannot allow this connection to be broken.zts14303e	First, take this scout party report to Noah, the Akamur Merchant President. He can be found in their camp. If you bring him this report he will be very grateful to you.zts14304e	And you are? I don't think we've ever met.zts14305e	(Noah reads the report with a worried look.)zts14306e	This is terrible! We'll have to take the next opportunity that presents itself! Thank you for coming all the way here to bring me the report. It would be great if you would stay at our camp a little while longer.zts14307e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Defence of the Harbourzts14308e	I thought the monster attacks had been increasing over the last few days, but apparently it's the work of the Desert Robbers.zts14309e	A few days ago I received a letter from Assistant Hamid in which he laid out his plans. Go to him first. You'll find in somewhere near Neil's Camp. He'll give you further instructions.zts14310e	Ah, it appears you're here at Harbour Guard Tom's request. So, the letter was delivered as planned. Wonderful!zts14311e	Let me explain our situation to you first. We have to try to delay the Desert Robbers' attack on the harbour. That should buy us enough time to prepare a counter-attack.zts14312e	Find the Bag of Prickly Pears that the Desert Robbers stole from the harbour. Over there, I saw one of the spies from Neil's reconnaissance patrol, and he had the bag with him. We don't have much time!zts14313e	Have you brought the Prickly Pears?zts14314e	Are these really the Prickly Pears we've been looking for? (Hamid takes a fleeting glance in the bag.) Excellent work!zts14315e	(Hamid examines the Prickly Pears and smiles. He takes out a small medicine bottle and sprinkles a few drops of liquid onto one of them.)zts14316e	I'm putting a special little poison on these Prickly Pears. We have to pay them back for the loss of our trade goods.zts14317e	Right then, take these Prickly Pears and distribute them in Neil's Camp. On the double!zts14318e	And... how did it go? Were you able to see the shocked looks on the Desert Robbers' faces?zts14319e	Well done! These scoundrels will never know what hit them! Wait, I have another job for you.zts14320e	Now that all the inhabitants of Neil's Camp have lost their minds, you must steal the stack of orders. I want to manipulate them a little bit, and make sure their strategic moves break down into chaos.zts14321e	The Command List will probably be found at the commander's place in Neil's Camp.zts14322e	What about the pile of orders?zts14323e	So that's the Desert Robbers' Command List. It looks well organised.zts14324e	(Hamid takes the forged Command List prepared earlier out of his pocket.)zts14325e	Take this list and place it where the commander is staying in Neil's Camp. That should put a spanner in the works for a little while.zts14326e	Did you manage it? Any signs of the forgery having an impact?zts14327e	(Hamid laughs out loud.)zts14328e	They won't be mounting any attacks on the harbour for now.zts14329e	Thanks!zts14330e	Just think about what sort of orders they have now... No need to wonder when the rascals start doing weird things.zts14331e	Without your help we'd have never been able to defend the harbour from the Desert Robbers. I've written up all of the missions you've carried out in one report. Deliver it to Harbour Guard Tom.zts14332e	He will duly reward you for your efforts.zts14333e	What brings you here? Do you have something for me?zts14334e	(Harbour Guard Tom reads Hamid's report attentively.)zts14335e	That's a really satisfying conclusion to our struggle against Neil's Desert Robbers. I'll see to it that you receive your due rewards.zts14336e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Dumb but Valuable Assistantzts14337e	Something terrible has happened! One of my assistants has been kidnapped by the Desert Robbers.zts14338e	Shane is unreliable and can't be left alone, but as much as I'd like to fire him, I cannot just abandon him to his fate.zts14339e	Unfortunately, I can't give you much information about his disappearance. Start by going to Neil's Camp and looking for him there. I'm sure that's where he's being held!zts14340e	Unbelievable! What was Tom thinking, sending someone like you to rescue me? Does he want me to die or something?zts14341e	Sorry, I guess I was thinking out loud. Please don't leave me here. You're my only hope! The Desert Robbers kidnapped me and brought me here. They've bound me up in iron chains and sealed them with locks.zts14342e	If you're to unshackle me, you're going to need the keys. Neil's Key Master has them. Bring them here and set me free!zts14343e	Do you have the keys?zts14344e	Thanks. Now we can remove the chains.zts14345e	(You try the keys in the lock, but it doesn't fit.)zts14346e	Huh?! You can't get the locks open? Then how will I escape?zts14347e	The Desert Robbers' jailer must have the key to open these locks. He's probably gone to have a jar with the other guards.zts14348e	Please, take him out and bring me back the key. Hurry!zts14349e	Do you have the key? Where is it?zts14350e	(You unlock the locks.)zts14351e	We're in luck, it fits! Let's get out of here as quickly as possible!zts14352e	I'm too weak to escape from here alone and I need your help.zts14353e	I've no more energy to fight against these Desert Robbers. Please deal with them so I can out of here unharmed. It's not going to be easy to shake them off our tail.zts14354e	What happened to Shane? Is he in one piece?zts14355e	(Harbour Guard Tom breathes a sigh of relief.)zts14356e	Thank goodness! Hamid tells me that Shane is quite alright. That's a big weight off my chest! For this, I shall reward you generously.zts14357e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Low-Priced Trade Goodszts14358e	You've surely heard by now that the harbour was attacked a few days ago. The goods that we store in the harbour and export from here are extremely important and valuable.zts14359e	We can't afford to lose any of them. The low-priced trade goods we're looking for are scattered all over the harbour's surroundings. Please bring them back!zts14360e	Would you able to scrounge up the low-priced trade goods?zts14361e	Thanks a lot! I've already arranged for an appropriate reward. Most of the trade goods are the property of the Akamur Merchants.zts14362e	They have prepared this reward for you.zts14363e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Regular Trade Goodszts14364e	This request concerns the average trade goods. To find them, head to Neil's Camp. These are the goods which the Desert Robbers left behind in their stupor.zts14365e	I need you to gather them all up and then take them to Hamid near Neil's Camp.zts14366e	How can I help?zts14367e	You've found the Akamur Merchants' broken trade goods! I'll get the other adventurers to bring them back to the harbour.zts14368e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Valuable Trade Goodszts14369e	It looks like the Desert Robbers have made off with our missing trade goods.zts14370e	We need to find the stolen goods right away. They're somewhere in Neil's Camp. Find them and bring them to Harbour Guard Tom straight away.zts14371e	Do you have the valuable trade goods?zts14372e	Well done. Here's the reward from the Akamur Merchants. There are still a lot of people waiting to get their property back.zts14373e	Countless goods are still missing, but if adventurers like you help us so industriously, we'll have them all back in no time. I'm very grateful to you.zts14374e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Petty Theftzts14375e	Have you heard? Our harbour has been attacked by fearsome monsters! On their hunt for food, they've taken or destroyed countless trade goods. I've seen it with my own eyes! The harbour residents were powerless against their attacks.zts14376e	Please search for the Sea Sand Fish and bring the stolen goods back to our harbour.zts14377e	Whatever become of those low-priced trade goods?zts14378e	Excellent work! The residents of the harbour are very grateful. They'll be talking about your feats for a long time to come. Now we can return the goods back to their rightful owners.zts14379e	In the name of the Akamur Merchants, I shall reward you for your efforts.zts14380e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Regular Goods Theftzts14381e	It turns out that the Desert Robbers were responsible for the attack on our harbour. They have gotten their hands on a great deal of our valuable trade goods.zts14382e	They're transporting our goods to Neil's Camp. It will be too late to get them back if they arrive there. Stop them on the way and get the trade goods back!zts14383e	Once you've retrieved the average trade goods, take them to Hamid. You can find him near the entrance to Neil's Camp. He'll see to it that the goods are returned to us.zts14384e	What's up? Why are you looking me out?zts14385e	I've been expecting you. Lighthouse Guard Chilton informed me that you would bring me the goods that were stolen from the harbour. I'll see to it that they find their way back to their rightful owners.zts14386e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Theft of the Valuable Trade Goodszts14387e	The Desert Robbers have managed to bring some of the stolen goods back to Neil's Camp. Make your way over there and retrieve the valuable trade goods!zts14388e	After you've taken possession of the valuable trade goods, bring them directly to Lighthouse Guard Chilton. He will reward you handsomely for your courage.zts14389e	What's up?zts14390e	The stolen trade goods! What good fortune that you've managed to seize our valuable trade goods from the Desert Robbers! The merchants have been waiting impatiently for this. Thank you very much!zts14391e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Search for the Akamur Merchants' Stolen Trade Goodszts14392e	The trade route between the Akamur Camp and Desert Eagle City has been cut off. It's also no longer possible to get through to Mortaz Desert Harbour. All the roads are blocked, making trade impossible.zts14393e	We've got to act now and do something about this!zts14394e	I'd like to have you help with this mission. Go and talk to Hazel. She will give you further instructions.zts14395e	Good that you're here. We need all the help we can get to solve our little problem.zts14396e	As the leader of the Akamur Merchants Noah has already said, we are now confronted with an unprecedented emergency.zts14397e	The bad thing about this situation is that valuable trade goods have been stolen. It's gotten so bad that the goods cannot be delivered to our customers on time. We need to retrieve those goods at all costs.zts14398e	If I am to believe my informants, they are scattered across the Akamur Merchants' East and West Merchant Camps. I beg you, please bring them back.zts14399e	There's no time to lose. Please hurry!zts14400e	It's only one first step, but thank you very much for your efforts.zts14401e	There have been some suspicious incidents in the West Merchant Camp. I hope this doesn't herald more difficulties with the Desert Robbers, like it did at Mortaz Desert Harbour.zts14402e	It's possible that they stole the Akamur Merchants' goods.zts14403e	If that's the case, then we can't afford to sit on our hands. Please eliminate the Desert Robbers and return the trade goods.zts14404e	Have you retrieved the trade goods? We've no time to lose. Please hurry.zts14405e	It really was the Desert Robbers. We must hurry.zts14406e	I'll keep the trade goods you've already returned safe.zts14407e	I've received some useful information.zts14408e	They'll no doubt be bringing the trade goods to a hidden location. Word has it that this is near Keru's Camp. I think this is a good time for getting the trade goods of the Akamur Merchants back.zts14409e	You can reach the area around Keru's Camp be crossing the East Merchant Camp and then heading south. Please hurry!zts14410e	What happened? Were you able to find anything?zts14411e	That's an Akamur merchant flag.zts14412e	We always have flags like that in the chests we transport our goods in. If the goods are stolen, you'll find flags in the chests.zts14413e	This flag confirms our suspicions.zts14414e	It's obvious how we should proceed.zts14415e	Our trade goods have already been carried off to Keru's Camp. We'll have to attack immediately if we're to get them back. The Akamur Merchants are counting on your help.zts14416e	It would be best to get some friends to help you. It might get very difficult and dangerous for you alone. I beg you, please bring the Akamur Merchants' trade goods back here.zts14417e	How's it going with the trade goods? Do you need some more time?zts14418e	Take a little rest before you head out again. We need to find out whether they really were the Akamur Merchants' trade goods.zts14419e	After checking the trade goods, we noticed that some important items are missing.zts14420e	They were taken to Keru's Camp, but they haven't been transported on from there. We can probably assume with great surety that the missing trade goods are still in the camp somewhere.zts14421e	Please search for the missing trade goods. You'll recognise the chests by the symbol of the Akamur Merchants. Bring these back.zts14422e	Do you have them? Are the trade goods undamaged?zts14423e	Just a moment, please. I'll check the goods momentarily.zts14424e	There are some goods which don't belong to the Akamur Merchants. We'll transport them to Desert Eagle City anyway. The merchants will take responsibility for them, so don't give it any more thought.zts14425e	Please take this report on the events of the last few days to Noah. He will present you with a reward in the name of the Akamur Merchants.zts14426e	Did Hazel send you? Have you brought me something?zts14427e	(Noah reads Hazel's report and smiles with satisfaction.)zts14428e	Thank you for your troubles. You will not regret having helped us. Take this reward!zts14429e	I hope we can count on your help again.zts14430e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Akamur Trade Routezts14431e	We had just completed our trade route and were on the way back to Desert Eagle City.zts14432e	Shortly before we reached our destination, we decided to take a break and rest a bit. Suddenly, we were attacked by fearsome monsters, making it impossible to travel any further. We've been stranded here now for several days and cannot get back home!zts14433e	Our trade goods must be brought to Desert Eagle City right away. Please help us to eliminate the monsters who are lurking about the Akamur Camp, so that we can resume our journey.zts14434e	How did it go? Are the monsters gone?zts14435e	Very well done! Rest a bit before your next important mission.zts14436e	Now that the monsters between Mortaz Desert Harbour and the Akamur Camp have been eliminated, it's time to take out the monsters on the road between here and Desert Eagle City.zts14437e	Eliminate the monsters blocking the road to the West Merchant Camp. When you've slain enough monsters, come back to me for more instructions.zts14438e	You haven't eliminated enough monsters yet. It would still be too dangerous for us to transport our trade goods.zts14439e	That should be plenty.zts14440e	Reliable sources indicate that the monsters blocking the trade route between Mortaz Desert Harbour and the Akamur Camp are receiving their orders from Melki's Campzts14441e	In order to get to Melki's Camp, you'll have to go through the East Merchant Camp and then head due south.zts14442e	Please hurry! If the solution to this problem is delayed any longer it will get ever more difficult to make the trade routes safe again.zts14443e	How is the situation around Melki's Camp? Were you able to fight off the monsters trying to muster east of the Akamur Merchants' camp?zts14444e	Fine, now we can prepare the next step!zts14445e	After speaking to Noah, we've come to the conclusion that we need to restore security to Desert Eagle City, now that the blockade of the trade route has been broken.zts14446e	Since you've completed all the tasks we've given you so far, we believe you'll also be able to master this next task.zts14447e	Make your way over to Keru's Camp Area. Help us get our lives back to normal.zts14448e	Ever more monsters are coming here from Keru's Camp. We can't let up now.zts14449e	Thank you very much for your efforts, brave adventurer! With your help we've been able to restore security to the trade route between Mortaz Desert Harbour and Desert Eagle City. We're going to take further measures to make sure that nothing threatens this security in the future.zts14450e	It seems that the trade routes have been secured for the time being.zts14451e	I've prepared a report about your work. Please bring this to Noah, so that he can present you with an appropriate reward.zts14452e	We shall never forget what you have done for the Akamur Merchants!zts14453e	What's new? Why are you here?zts14454e	Now we can begin to transport the important trade goods to Desert Eagle City. Despite your help, it wasn't easy. Thanks to you, we can now bring our goods to our customers and regain their trust in us. In the name of all the Akamur Merchants, I shall reward you handsomely!zts14455e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and Negotiations with the Desert Robberszts14456e	We're going to need a peaceful solution if we're to get this situation fully under control. In my opinion, we need to open negotiations with the Desert Robbers. You probably think this a little cowardly of me, but I see no other way to achieving an amicable solution.zts14457e	I'm preparing a plan for the negotiations. Bring these to Hazel so that you can talk to her about the details.zts14458e	Do you have something to tell me?zts14459e	(Hazel reads Noah's plan and tears it to shreds.)zts14460e	We cannot allow ourselves to forget that these are dangerous thieves! We shouldn't allow negotiations like this. Unfortunately there's nothing I can do about it, if that's what Noah wants. If the negotiations with these Desert Robbers don't go according to plan, we'll have to put them under pressure using other means right away.zts14461e	We're going to have to find a way to make contact with the Desert Robbers first, before we can bring them to the negotiating table.zts14462e	Reliable sources tell me that Mursha, representative for the Desert Robbers, is staying at Keru's Camp.zts14463e	Here, I've written him a message. Go to Keru's Camp, look for Representative Mursha and present him with the message.zts14464e	(Hazel smiles.)zts14465e	Just remember to be on your guard! The Desert Robbers are a dangerous bunch. It's possible they won't be willing to enter negotiations and simply attack you instead.zts14466e	What are you doing here? Are you an agent of the Akamur Merchants?zts14467e	(You present Mursha with the message.)zts14468e	What the?! Are you trying to make fun of us?zts14469e	Guards! Seize this Akamur Merchant spy and lock him up!zts14470e	(Mursha calls for the guards.)zts14471e	What the devil are you guards doing? Are you deaf?zts14472e	How?! Are those assassins' masks? How were you able to defeat them? (Mursha looks frightened.)zts14473e	(Mursha tries to look calm.)zts14474e	Guards! Are you just going to stand there? Seize him, I said!zts14475e	And you call yourselves Desert Robbers?zts14476e	I won't give up so easily.zts14477e	(Mursha takes a step backwards.) The emblems of our Desert Robbers! But that's not possible!zts14478e	Ha, you weakling! You don't stand a chance against Commander Keru! You'd beat you with one arm tied behind his back!zts14479e	Commander Keru is very strong. You're not powerful enough to stand against him.zts14480e	(When Mursha sees the seal he kneels before you immediately.)zts14481e	That's it, there's no hope left! We have lost. I surrender!zts14482e	This is a secret message from our powerful leader Ibrahim. Bring it to the Akamur Merchants immediately.zts14483e	(You take the message and think about who you should give it to in the Akamur Camp.)zts14484e	How did it go with the Desert Robbers' representative? Were you able to find out anything?zts14485e	A secret message from Ibrahim, leader of the Desert Robbers? Maybe it contains some important information for us.zts14486e	(Hazel reads the secret message and tears it apart with rage.)zts14487e	This is pure provocation! They won't engage in negotiations, they're just making fools out of the lot of us! That really makes me mad.zts14488e	This message confirms what I already expected. Go to Noah now and tell him that we have to prepare ourselves for a face-off with the Desert Robbers.zts14489e	How did the negotiations with the Desert Robbers go? Did they accept my proposal?zts14490e	So there's no hope of finding a peaceful solution. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything less, but it is still a great disappointment.zts14491e	Thank you very much for your troubles. The Akamur Merchants shall reward you handsomely for your brave deeds.zts14492e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Liberation of the Merchantszts14493e	The second command list!zts14494e	The Desert Robbers' leader Ibrahim wants to press ahead with the fight against the Akamur Merchants.zts14495e	If we kidnap the Akamur Merchants' important people, steal their trade goods, and disrupt their trade routes, that will make our leader very happy.zts14496e	One of the Akamur Merchants' assistants has been successfully kidnapped. Make sure he is brought to our dungeon as soon as possible.Mursha.zts14497e	Is there something important? I'm busy right now trying to keep track of the damage caused by the Desert Robbers.zts14498e	That is truly not good news.zts14499e	(Hazel puts on a serious face.)zts14500e	Do I look unperturbed? I'm not. There is much I have to think about. I may look calm as a cucumber, but that's not how it is.zts14501e	I would like this incident resolved quietly. Please don't let Noah find out about this.zts14502e	We need to think up a plan to free the Desert Robbers' prisoners. It's hard to say how many Akamur Merchants have been captured, but we know with certainty that they are being held captive in Melki's Camp. To make their escape possible, we're going to have to take out as many Desert Robbers as we can.zts14503e	Now get going to Melki's Camp!zts14504e	Who's there? Are we going to be executed? Please don't! I still have so many plans for my life...zts14505e	Have you been sent to rescue me?zts14506e	If you've made it all the way to me, that means you've eliminated all the Desert Robbers, right? Then untie me quickly!zts14507e	We're going to need a key. The jailer who has the key must be somewhere around Melki's Camp. Get it and set me free!zts14508e	The jailer's key! Did you get it? No other key can open the lock. Be quick, hurry!zts14509e	Thanks! Now I can escape!zts14510e	I'm just a simple merchant. I never learned how to defend myself from the Desert Robbers.zts14511e	You'll have to clear the way for me to get out of here and back to the Akamur Camp. If you take care of the robbers in Melki's Camp, then I can help the other merchants escape undetected.zts14512e	Afterwards, report to Hazel that I was able to escape.zts14513e	Well, what happened? Were the captives able to escape?zts14514e	I've just received the message. Thanks, you did a great job!zts14515e	Fortunately the news arrived just after an important meeting here with Noah.zts14516e	The meeting went down without any further problems. You will be given credit for your services.zts14517e	Noah wants to see you with a report on recent events. Take this report and go find him.zts14518e	Don't you have something to hand over to me?zts14519e	So you're the hero who freed my people. Thank you so much! The situation isn't particularly favourable for the Akamur Merchants at the moment.zts14520e	The Desert Robbers' provocations and attacks are getting more and more intense. We're going to have to muster up enough strength to put up a resistance.zts14521e	We'll reward you generously for your help so far.zts14522e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Road to Melki's Campzts14523e	The goal of this plan is to render Melki's Camp harmless. Even though our forces are not especially large, we'll have a chance at success if we can cut off the connections between Melki's Camp and remaining enemy forces.zts14524e	Take a look at the map. The road from the Akamur Camp to Melki's Camp runs near the eastern part of the merchant camp. At the moment, monsters are blocking this area. This road will have to be secured if we're to launch an assault on Melki's Camp. Go now and deal with the monsters in the eastern part of the merchant camp.zts14525e	Were you successful in eliminating the monsters?zts14526e	I think now is a good time to put our next plan into action.zts14527e	Our next target is Melki's Camp Area. It's an area that we will certainly have to cross on the way to Melki's Camp. Unfortunately there's no alternative!zts14528e	The Desert Robbers will put up some stiff resistance. We'll be forced to take on the creatures in Melki's Camp Area and the Desert Robbers simultaneously.zts14529e	Whether or not our plan succeeds depends entirely on you and your skills.zts14530e	Is everything running according to plan? Is the blocked road still insecure?zts14531e	Nothing else stands in the way of an attack on Melki's Camp.zts14532e	Now the path to Melki's Camp is clear and we can prepare our attack.zts14533e	Our plan will be difficult for you to accomplish alone. Feel free to get a trusted friend with you on your journey. Now go to Melki's Camp and take out the Desert Robbers there.zts14534e	Have you eliminated all resistance in Melki's Camp? What has become of Commander Melki?zts14535e	We've emerged victorious in the battle against Melki and his Desert Robbers. And we have you to thank for everything! With this victory we can continue to work hard towards securing our trade routes.zts14536e	In this war against the Desert Robbers, we've always been able to rely on your abilities.zts14537e	If more adventurers come to help us, we will achieve even more victories in the struggle against the Desert Robbers in the future.zts14538e	Here's the report I've made about the latest events. Take it to Noah immediately. He's waiting anxiously to hear news of our victory.zts14539e	How did it go? Did you manage to neutralise Melki's Camp? Tell me about it.zts14540e	Finally, the Akamur Merchants can breathe easily again. We have you to thank.zts14541e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Road to Keru's Campzts14542e	We're currently planning a surprise attack on Keru's Camp. However, we shouldn't rush it until we've been able to prepare thoroughly.zts14543e	We'll have to go through West Merchant Camp to reach Keru's Camp. There are countless creatures roaming around there. We must get rid of them before we can make the journey. Head over there now and hunt down the monsters.zts14544e	You'll have to take care of them quickly. We can't afford any big delays.zts14545e	The attack on Keru's Camp is only a distraction that will help us solve two problems at the same time. It will clear the path to Desert Eagle City and we'll be free to send our trade goods there.zts14546e	According to my report, the elimination of the monsters has given the Desert Robbers the chance to spread out.zts14547e	If that is so, we'll have to neutralise the monsters and Desert Robbers in Keru's Camp Area so we can make a concerted attack on the camp.zts14548e	Please go to Keru's Camp as quickly as possible. You'll have to cross West Merchant Camp in order to get there.zts14549e	I'm somewhat afraid that the Desert Robbers might launch a counter-attack. Why haven't you left yet?zts14550e	I'm anxious about how the battle against the Desert Robbers will play out. The total annihilation of the Desert Robbers in the Akamur Camp would mean safety on our trade routes.zts14551e	Now let's carry out our plan.zts14552e	Now we'll attack Keru's Camp directly. We have to eliminate the Desert Robbers in Keru's Camp.zts14553e	Find some trustworthy companions and head over there with them.zts14554e	You'll have to hurry so that no one suspects anything.zts14555e	The battle against Keru was a resounding victory!zts14556e	Take this report of the battle against Commander Keru in Keru's Camp to President Noah.zts14557e	He's waiting for you now. Ever since the struggle against the Desert Robbers began, he's been very tense.zts14558e	What news from Keru's Camp? Has it been eradicated? Come on, out with it!zts14559e	Thank goodness! Now we can also supply Desert Eagle City with our trade goods.zts14560e	Thanks to you, we have one less thing to worry about. The Akamur Merchants value your assistance, and we will reward you greatly.zts14561e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Desert Robbers' Intentionszts14562e	In the last few days, the Desert Robbers' pillaging has increased dramatically.zts14563e	It's becoming a serious problem. I'm genuinely very afraid in such situations, but as I am the leader of the Akamur Merchants, I must remain strong and not let my fear show.zts14564e	We Akamur Merchants really need your help. Please talk to Semia, our representative, first.zts14565e	I have composed a letter to Noah. It contains important information on the Desert Robbers. We will strive to find out even more about them.zts14566e	While waiting for you, I've been trying to come up with a way out of this situation. I think we have to launch a simultaneous attack from the Akamur Camp and Desert Eagle City.zts14567e	We should concentrate on Keru's Camp first. It lies to the south of Desert Eagle City. Your task is to go to this camp and obtain valuable information from Commander Keru.zts14568e	How did it go? Did you find out anything useful?zts14569e	Good, they left information behind in Keru's Camp.zts14570e	According to the information you've retrieved, the Desert Robbers want to cut Desert Eagle City off from the outside world. Garton's Camp has been set up for this purpose. One of our guards, Putran, has been sent there.zts14571e	Go to Garton's Camp Area and look for Guard Putran. He has received further instructions for you.zts14572e	Are you the adventurer everyone's been talking about? I knew it must be you!zts14573e	(Guard Putran points out the way to Garton's Camp.)zts14574e	This is one of the Desert Robbers' outposts, from which they plan to attack the Desert Eagle City. To keep the city safe, we're going to have to smash Garton's Camp. From now on we're going to have to watch the Desert Robbers' every movement.zts14575e	How should we go about dealing with the Desert Robbers?zts14576e	I don't think we'll really manage to gather very much information, but at least we can make a start.zts14577e	Let's muster up all of our courage and attack Garton's Camp. We have to be able to see what they're up to. First we need to take out a few Desert Robbers and then spy on the remaining ones.zts14578e	And? Were they behaving suspiciously?zts14579e	(Putran makes a disappointed face when you tell him that you saw nothing peculiar.)zts14580e	If I watch them long enough, I'm bound to notice something.zts14581e	Until now I haven't been able to observe anything particular about Garton's Camp.zts14582e	(Putran grins as if he's just had a brilliant idea.)zts14583e	You know, it's just possible that Commander Garton has some important information for us. Can you find out if that's true?zts14584e	Were you able to get any information? Anything that could be of use to us?zts14585e	Here's the report. It will tell us what the Desert Robbers have planned. We'll keep their schemes in mind when making our own future plans. Our goal is to eradicate them, since there's no way for us to avoid them without great difficulty.zts14586e	I have read the reports that you brought me, but unfortunately I don't understand them. They surely concern something important.zts14587e	We need to inform the Akamur Merchants of the current situation over here. Go to the Akamur Quarter in Desert Eagle City and bring the reports to Semia.zts14588e	Do you have something to tell me?zts14589e	This is a secret report from the Desert Robbers that was designed only for internal use. It's identical to the report you brought to us before. We're going to have to decode this if we're to discover what the Desert Robbers are planning.zts14590e	I've found out that there are some people with close contacts to the Desert Robbers.zts14591e	One of them lives in the Chaos Zone near Desert Eagle City. Since we don't know what the Desert Robbers are planning, it would be to our advantage to find out as much as we can.zts14592e	Go to him right away!zts14593e	(The drunken Xavier looks at you with a glazed look in his eyes.)zts14594e	You again! Did you at least bring me something to drink?zts14595e	The Desert Robbers are concocting a pointless plan. They're searching for some Akamur trade goods which they brought here. What exactly they're looking for is not clear. I'm not sure this information will be helpful to you and the Akamur Merchants. I've summarised the exact contents of the reports for you. Take it to the Akamur Merchants.zts14596e	How did it go? What's in the document? Come on, spit it out!zts14597e	I'll read it this instant, just wait a moment.zts14598e	Xavier is talking nonsense! This information is useless to us. According to his report, their schemes aren't directed against the Akamur Merchants, they're merely looking for certain trade goods. If we just keep watching events a little longer, I'm sure we'll find out what they're after.zts14599e	Take this reward.zts14600e	I've summarised the latest events in this report. Take it to Nephi. She will inform you about our further plans and take care of your reward.zts14601e	What happened? Were you able to complete your mission?zts14602e	This report means bad news for the Akamur Merchants. You carried out your tasks well. You will receive an appropriate reward for your achievements.zts14603e	Thank you very much!zts14604e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Last Negotiationszts14605e	You've collected some really useful information. He appears to have a special connection to the Desert Robbers. His name is Velmon and he's a butcher in the Chaos Zone. It's not important what sort of person he used to be, as long as he is able to open up negotiations with the Desert Robbers for us. He says it is moot to argue about the past. The money for the negotiations has already been set aside. Take it to Velmon.zts14606e	Hmm... it's not as easy as Semia thinks. It will take a long time, and I'm not sure how great my connections to the Desert Robbers are at the moment. I don't know how much help I would be.zts14607e	(Velmon looks concerned.)zts14608e	I have no other choice but to help the Akamur Merchants. Of course, that's going to cost you a fair bit.zts14609e	Back when I was still a Desert Robber, I had some friends. Fortunately, I was able to maintain my friendship with one person after we left the Desert Robbers. I'll introduce you to him.zts14610e	So, here is the list of demands. Go and show it to him.zts14611e	Who are you? Leave this place immediately if it's got nothing to do with the Desert Robbers.zts14612e	Are you the adventurer butcher Velmon sent? If that's the case, we can talk freely.zts14613e	(You here a strange noise nearby.)zts14614e	Did you hear that?! Oh no! Someone's been listening in on our conversation! Get out there right now and eliminate all the Desert Robbers lingering nearby! If anyone finds out that you came looking for me, things are going to get really difficult.zts14615e	How did it go? Were you able to find him?zts14616e	Now we can talk freely without having to worry.zts14617e	You must prove to me that I can completely trust you. They say that the Desert Robbers are keeping a suspicious potion at their camp, and I need it badly. Bring it to me, and I'll be able to trust you.zts14618e	Well? Were you able to find it?zts14619e	It appears you really are trustworthy!zts14620e	I'm sorry, but the negotiations with the Desert Robbers have been cut off. Now I need to see to it that I get away from here. Make your mind up whether you're going to accept my request. I can give you some really useful information...zts14621e	I've decided to leave the Desert Robbers. The only thing standing in my way are the robbers in the area. I've been the leader of this gang here for longer than I can remember, but they aren't the robbers I grew up with. They've changed.zts14622e	Help me to get out of here by taking out the robbers in the area. When you come back, I'll tell you everything else you want to know.zts14623e	Have you dealt with them?zts14624e	I'm really amazed. You're even better than I thought.zts14625e	I don't think it would do much good to tell you personally, so take this secret message to the people who sent you. After you set off, I'm going to head to the Chaos Zone as well, to see my old friend Velmon.zts14626e	How did the negotiations go? Were they successful?zts14627e	That's a shame. But since the prospects didn't look so good anyway, I was already prepared for it. However, this letter demonstrates to me your great skills. I think we'll be able to move ahead with the elimination of the Desert Robbers more quickly in the future.zts14628e	I've written a report about the negotiations. Take it to Nephi, and she will take care of your reward.zts14629e	What happened? Do you have good news? Let me take a deep breath.zts14630e	I did hold some hope, but there's clearly nothing we can do about it. Even my big brother Noah won't be able to do much. Thank you anyway. Please keep working for us, there's still so much to do.zts14631e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword - Know Your Enemy Like Yourselfzts14632e	Noah from the Akamur Camp sent this letter. I don't think it's meant for me, but for Semia. She'll know what to do next.zts14633e	The letter has never been opened. You say it's from Noah? Just a moment, please.zts14634e	Noah got back from a trade expedition half a year ago, but because of the Desert Robbers, he cannot travel any further. I can't forgive the Desert Robbers for that.zts14635e	In the letter its says that the Akamur Merchants need to react strongly to the incidents involving the Desert Robbers. My opinion is no different. But there has to be an effective conclusion to it all. I'm going to forge a new plan over the coming days.zts14636e	First take this letter and go to the Chaos Zone. There you'll come across a stern-looking man they call Velmon. Find out about the Desert Robbers from him.zts14637e	What is it? Are you the reinforcements for the Chaos Zone guards?zts14638e	Did the Akamur Merchants send you? They've been sending a lot of people here lately.zts14639e	Are the Akamur Merchants trying to collect information on the Desert Robbers?zts14640e	Each Desert Robber commander possesses an outline of his own camp. Of course, they're not just lying about waiting to be found, but they're somewhere inside the camps. That should be enough information for you to be able to find them.zts14641e	If you don't eliminate Keru and his Desert Robbers soon, he'll be able to take the plan somewhere else. You have to hurry!zts14642e	There might be something in the chest...zts14643e	You can find a part of the plan you've been looking for inside the chest.zts14644e	Keru's Camp is clearly visible on the plan. The names of the Desert Robbers are also listed. We have to take the plan to Velmon and find the other pieces.zts14645e	Were you able to find anything?zts14646e	Since Commander Keru's name is on it, it looks like it's the right plan.zts14647e	The Akamur Merchants seem to be planning a major attack on the Desert Robbers. The residents of the Chaos Zone have also been having a lot of problems with the Desert Robbers recently. Go to Garton's Camp. You'll find additional useful information for the Akamur Merchants there. First you should take out the Desert Robbers and Garton, then look for the hidden plan.zts14648e	It looks like what you're looking for is in there.zts14649e	You've found the plan from Garton's Camp!zts14650e	It contains information about the Desert Robbers belonging to Garton's Camp. Some of the words are barely legible, but that shouldn't be a problem for Velmon.zts14651e	Was there any useful information in Garton's Camp?zts14652e	That looks like the plan from Garton's Camp. I'll check and see if it contains any important information, and then let you know.zts14653e	The words are hard to make out. We might be dealing with some coded information. Take these plans to Xavier. Maybe he can help you.zts14654e	(Xavier looks at you with glassy eyes.)zts14655e	If you're only here to bother me, I suggest you rather just shove off. If not, well then, let me see what you've got in your hands.zts14656e	(Xavier looks at the plans and tries to put them in the correct order.)zts14657e	Hmm... looks like the Desert Robbers plan to destroy everything that stands in their way.zts14658e	There was also a password among the coded information. It's a very simple one, probably not used for anything important.zts14659e	I'll write it down for you so you don't forget it. Take it to whoever sent you here. Next time get them to send some rum along with you!zts14660e	Were you able to get any useful information?zts14661e	We know now what's going on in Keru and Garton's Camps. We have to think about how we can beat them! What's this?zts14662e	(Semia discovers the password decoded by Xavier.)zts14663e	What is it supposed to mean? Never mind, we can figure that out later.zts14664e	Thank you very much! I've already prepared your reward.zts14665e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Annihilation of the Desert Robberszts14666e	We have to launch a major offensive against the Desert Robbers. The Akamur Merchants have unanimously decided that this is what we must do.zts14667e	Bring these orders to Semia. She's going to be leading this campaign.zts14668e	I've been waiting for you. Have you brought the orders?zts14669e	The Desert Robbers' counter-attack will first concentrate on Desert Eagle City. We have to keep in mind that our focus is not on eliminating the Desert Robbers, but on restoring the trade routes for the Akamur Merchants.zts14670e	I'm going to tell you about our plan to launch a major offensive against the Desert Robber camp. They've set up a hide-out to the north-east of Akamur Camp. Head over there immediately with some trusted comrades and eradicate the Desert Robbers. Then you need to enter their headquarters, where Commanders Shoran and Shay are stationed. Eliminate them!zts14671e	How did it go in the camp? Have you dealt them a serious enough blow that they will never recover from?zts14672e	You were really able to defeat the commanders? Then we've gained the upper hand in this battle.zts14673e	This is the first attack on the Desert Robbers under my leadership. I've prepared a detailed report on the events. Take it to Nephi. She will also present you with your reward.zts14674e	How did it go? Was no one injured in the battle against the Desert Robbers?zts14675e	These skirmishes with the Desert Robbers are becoming more and more dangerous. I hope it hasn't already cost you too much of your strength. Wait a moment.zts14676e	(Nephi is totally convinced of you.)zts14677e	The Akamur Merchants would like to give you credit for your deeds. Take this reward!zts14678e	I've done this many times before, but I'm still nervous. You fought bravely! Thank you very much!zts14679e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Search for the Valuable Trade Goodszts14680e	Because of the Desert Robbers, we've lost the confidence of our customers. In order to undo this, we're going to have to retrieve the stolen relics. Go to Semia in the Akamur Camp for more detailed instructions.zts14681e	Do you have something to tell me? Don't worry, you can tell me anything.zts14682e	The place where the stolen relics are being kept has been marked on this map of the Akamur Camp. We have no choice, we must get them back.zts14683e	Are you ready? I'm going to tell you what we intend to do, so listen up! The stolen relics that you are to bring to the Aster Temple are in Keru's Camp. Look for a chest, and inside you'll find the relics. You should be able to recognise them by the emblem of the Akamur Merchants. Please bring them back!zts14684e	Have you brought them?zts14685e	What good fortune! These are very important relics. Wait a moment, I'll try to find out more about them.zts14686e	(Semia opens up a scroll and appears to look for something on it.)zts14687e	These relics were stolen from Aster Temple. Afterwards they were dispersed in several different robber camps. The Akamur Merchants were tasked with finding them a long time ago. We need to find the remaining relics. The Aster Temple is waiting.zts14688e	There must be more relics in Garton's Camp. Go there and look for the chest containing them.zts14689e	How did it go? Did you find them?zts14690e	Fortunately the relic is intact. Wait a moment, I need to find out where the next stolen relic is to be found.zts14691e	Now we have to find the last relics. I have received information indicating that they have been brought to the Desert Robber Camp. They are supplying the other robber camps. This will be a very dangerous mission, so be on your guard! Make sure you're well prepared for your task.zts14692e	Have you found the final relic?zts14693e	Thank goodness you were able to retrieve it. Thank you very much!zts14694e	Bring this relic to High Priest Eladin in Aster Temple. He has long been hankering for it. We Akamur Merchants thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Adventurer, that we've been able to accomplish what we wanted to. You may collect your reward at Aster Temple.zts14695e	I've heard that the relic has been returned to the Aster Temple... Are you the adventurer responsible for its recovery?zts14696e	The priests of Aster Temple would like to express our gratitude to you and the Akamur Merchants. If you have time, we'd like you to stay here for a little while and help us.zts14697e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Merchant Prisonerzts14698e	Whoever holds this scroll in his hands:zts14699e	My name is Sharif and I belong to the Akamur Merchants. I am being held prisoner by the Desert Robbers in their camp and I need help. Please free me!zts14700e	Who are you? Are you one of the Desert Robbers' new recruits? You're probably not the person who read my note, are you? Please spare me... I regret having to plead... but please don't kill me...zts14701e	You're one of the adventurers who helped the Akamur Merchants? Thank heavens you found my scroll. Please help me to break free!zts14702e	As I'm still alive, I should return to Desert Eagle City. I need to inform everyone immediately that I was kidnapped. But first you need to get me out of here! Please take out the nearby Desert Robbers and bring me the key to unlock these chains.zts14703e	What happened? Do you have the key?zts14704e	Finally, I can leave this dreadful place. The last few days I was imprisoned here were terrifying.zts14705e	Hurry! Time is running out! Soon I won't be able to escape!zts14706e	Give me some more time by taking out the Desert Robbers in the area. I'll seek out Semia in Desert Eagle City immediately and tell her about the kidnapping. If you come by later, she will surely reward you for freeing me.zts14707e	What's the matter? Do you have something to tell me?zts14708e	The Akamur Merchant Sharif was here and he told me about your brave deeds. We are like a big family who support each other even in difficult situations. You saved that merchant's life. We will always be grateful to you for that. Here, take this reward!zts14709e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Curious Reliczts14710e	It looks like part of a very ancient relic. It's clearly been broken into several pieces, which lie scattered in the area. Take it with you and bring it to the Akamur Merchants.zts14711e	Have you brought me something? Perhaps I can help you, at least to the boundaries of my knowledge...zts14712e	It appears to be a relic that was ordered by Aster Temple.zts14713e	Take the bag containing the relic to Nephi. As you can see, I'm already busy with something else at the moment. Nephi will reward you for your troubles.zts14714e	You seem to be carrying something with you. What is it? Let me see.zts14715e	It appears to be a relic that was ordered by Aster Temple.zts14716e	(Nephi reads a scroll.)zts14717e	Ah, yes, here it is. Thank you. I hope we can count on your help in the future as well.zts14718e	The Aster Temple has cancelled all activities outside of the building for now. To those outside, this seems like a peaceful place, but danger looms. It's lurking directly beneath us!zts14719e	(High Priest Eladin points at the ground.)zts14720e	I beg you, please help us investigate the incidents in the Aster Temple. Priestess Vera can give you more detailed information. Go and speak with her.zts14721e	I've been waiting for you. Please rest while I explain everything to you.zts14722e	A short time ago there was a huge explosion in the temple.zts14723e	Unfortunately we haven't been able to investigate the cause of this explosion yet, as the spirits of the dead are keeping us back. The best thing would be to get rid of these spirits as quickly as possible. We are doing everything in our power to prevent the spirits from escaping the temple.zts14724e	Go into the temple, where you'll find Aster Courtyard. This place is crawling with spirits, so be careful!zts14725e	What was in the library? Did you find anything odd?zts14726e	They're the spirits of former monks at this temple. They served the Sun God and possessed power over fire. That's why they were called the Red Magicians. Now they can rest in peace.zts14727e	Go back to the Aster Courtyard and investigate the back of the hall.zts14728e	There are also spirits there who must be defeated so that they can be put to rest. There will probably be more tasks like this in the future.zts14729e	Very strange things are happening here, which is why I can't really tell you anything definite about the Aster Temple. The priest and I are deeply saddened by the explosion.zts14730e	The prayer hall can be found in the centre of the temple. Everything has been laid to waste there. Investigate this place and free the spirits from their misery.zts14731e	You'll have to go along the Aster Temple corridor to get to the Aster Centre. Don't get lost!zts14732e	Did anything happen in the prayer hall?zts14733e	It seems you've overlooked something. But there must be a clue. Are you going about this the wrong way maybe?zts14734e	Now the investigation of the Aster Temple is almost complete. Only the Centre Sanctum remains. Traces of the explosion should be visible somewhere, but you haven't been able to find anything certain, have you? I think there will be clues to find at the Centre Sanctum.zts14735e	We need to give this place a thorough examination, if only for the sake of those Aster Temple priests who sacrificed themselves. Head to the Centre Sanctum underground and eliminate the spirits haunting the place.zts14736e	Couldn't you find out anything there either? Please tell me exactly what you saw.zts14737e	(Priestess Vera examines the ruined relic.)zts14738e	This is a relic that was kept sealed away deep inside the temple. It's been completely destroyed by the explosion.zts14739e	(Priestess Vera hands you a report she has prepared.)zts14740e	Present this report to High Priest Eladin. I am going to have to investigate more here. As a survivor of this catastrophe, it's my duty to find out what happened here.zts14741e	Were the investigations underneath Aster Temple successful?zts14742e	The Seal of the Relics has been destroyed. This is very disturbing. I have read the report thoroughly and would like to thank you for your help. Please take this as a reward for your efforts.zts14743e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Chaos of Aster Templezts14744e	There's something regarding my investigations of the explosion in Aster Temple that you may still be able to help me with.zts14745e	I would like you to defeat the remaining spirits in the temple and collect their essence. If I can concentrate it, then I can use it to lead the spirits to their own world.zts14746e	The spirits are at the entrance of the temple. Bring me their essence!zts14747e	How was it? How much spirit essence were you able to collect?zts14748e	I can feel the spirit essence's energy.zts14749e	Something's wrong with the spirit essence. There's something strange about it. I'm saying you've brought me the wrong essence. Maybe there just isn't enough.zts14750e	Get me more spirit essence so I can investigate further. This time I need the essence of the Lamentation Leader from Aster Courtyard.zts14751e	How was it? Was there anything odd in the underground caves? I hope it doesn't sound too strange to ask you if something odd happened where the spirits are making trouble...zts14752e	The spirit essence energy keeps getting stronger. I have my suspicions as to why this is happening.zts14753e	The spirits of the dead priests have been under some strange influence since the explosion. I suspect that an evil creature appeared during the explosion, and that this creature is responsible for all of this. But I can't know for sure until I have investigated further.zts14754e	Please help me to explore this further. Also I'd like you to bring me more spirit essence, if you can.zts14755e	Were you able to find anything out?zts14756e	It feels like a dark power is trying to spread inside the temple. I doubt I'll be able to concentrate the spirit essence. What am I going to do?zts14757e	I need more spirit essence so I can keep studying in Aster Temple. You're going to a dangerous place this time. I hope the investigations are as successful as they were last time.zts14758e	The next place I need you to get spirit essence from is Aster Temple. It's possible that's where everything started. Defeat the spirits there and bring me their essence.zts14759e	Leave as soon as you are ready.zts14760e	What was at the Centre Sanctum? Were you able to find anything?zts14761e	The spirit essence you've brought seem to contain strong dark power. The power is enormous and incomparable to the other essence. The Aster Centre must have been where the explosion happened.zts14762e	How unfortunate. I'll have to consider what we should do now.zts14763e	There was an ancient, evil creature trapped behind a seal in the centre of the Aster Temple. The explosion destroyed the seal and the creature was freed. My next task is to find out what kind of creature we're dealing with.zts14764e	This bag contains the spirit essences you gathered recently. High Priest Eladin will take care of concentrating them for me, as my powers are too weak. I'll work on the less-powerful essences.zts14765e	Thank you for your help. I am in your debt.zts14766e	So this is the spirit essence. I know what to do with them.zts14767e	(High Priest Eladin and the spirit essences begin to glow brightly.)zts14768e	Do you see that? That's the souls of the dead who are now going back to their world in peace.zts14769e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword - May the Spirits Rest in Peacezts14770e	We ordered some goods from the Akamur Merchants a while ago, but unfortunately they still haven't arrived. As of yet we have received no word from them. The order is important, and we need some of the goods immediately. Can you go to the Akamur Quarter and check if they ever received our order?zts14771e	What's the matter?zts14772e	The Aster Temple order? I'll look right away!zts14773e	Unfortunately the goods on this list still haven't arrived. They're probably some of the ones stolen by the Desert Robbers. But we're in the process of getting them again. It shouldn't be much longer now.zts14774e	If it's very urgent, go take the Aster Temple order list to Semia.zts14775e	Is it very urgent? Only I'm quite busy...zts14776e	I am working on obtaining the goods the Aster Temple ordered, but it might take a little longer.zts14777e	I know the temple's order down to the smallest detail. You don't need to bring me a list.zts14778e	The stolen goods can be found at Garton's Camp.zts14779e	Once you're at the camp, look for a chest with the Akamur Merchants' emblem on it. It must be there.zts14780e	I'm afraid I can't give you any more information. Now go and search for the stolen goods.zts14781e	Did you bring the right one?zts14782e	Just a second, I'm going to check the order. You are amazingly competent - are you sure you don't want to work for the Akamur Merchants?zts14783e	Return to Aster Temple with these goods. Tell High Priest Eladin that the Akamur Merchants always do their best to satisfy their customers.zts14784e	Have the Akamur Merchants received the goods we ordered?zts14785e	The incense sticks! I've been waiting for these. We still need a few things that weren't on the list. Nothing you can do about that. Thank you very much!zts14786e	Please wait a moment. I'd like to ask another favour of you.zts14787e	(High Priest Eladin lights an incense stick.)zts14788e	Take this to the temple. There you'll find Priestess Nora. She's passed away, but her spirit is still there. Tell her that I am sorry for not protecting her.zts14789e	One day, two days, three days...zts14790e	Priestess Nora has a strange way of counting the days - she only counts up to 30 and then starts again from the top.zts14791e	I don't know how high I've counted. That must surely be 30 days...zts14792e	A soothing fragrance is streaming out of the incense stick you've lit. It is brightening my gloomy mood. Totally different to before. I don't know who I am or what I'm doing here. It seems I was part of an unfortunate accident.zts14793e	Can you light incense for my friends as well?zts14794e	They must be in the Aster Temple somewhere.zts14795e	And? Were my friends happy too?zts14796e	Even if they didn't respond, I'm sure it brought them happiness.zts14797e	I'm beginning to remember myself. There was a loud explosion while I was looking for a way out of the temple. When I came to my senses, I no longer had a sense of time.zts14798e	(Priestess Nora looks listless.)zts14799e	Something terrible happened inside Aster Temple. My friend was going to go and investigate something there. Please bring him some incense.zts14800e	How did it go? Is my friend okay?zts14801e	I can sense my friend's fragrance on you. Thank you very much.zts14802e	My memories are slowly coming back.zts14803e	We were here inside the temple, giving someone a tour. We were recounting the legends of Aster Temple. Suddenly, something happened and the cleric ran towards the Aster Centre. I can't remember any more at the moment.zts14804e	Go to Aster Centre and find out what happened to the cleric. Take an incense stick with you.zts14805e	What happened? Is he okay?zts14806e	So he's dead?zts14807e	(Priestess Nora bows her head.)zts14808e	That's okay. It makes me sad, but it's not like I can change anything. Thanks to your incense sticks, my memories are becoming clearer and clearer. We need to find out if this place is still safe for the other priests.zts14809e	Go to Aster Centre and look for the treasure hunter. That's where the explosion took place. If it's not safe there, light another incense stick.zts14810e	How was it at the Centre Sanctum?zts14811e	It's like a nightmare. No one is nearby. I have this feeling like I need to wake up to make everything like it was before.zts14812e	Now I can remember everything. I'm dead and I haven't been able to realise it this whole time.zts14813e	(You briefly hear quiet sobbing.)zts14814e	I don't have much time. We must inform the priests of this incident. I have gathered all my strength and composed this letter. You must give it to him. Also, please tell him that he is in no way responsible.zts14815e	(Priestess Nora's body slowly fades away.)zts14816e	What is it? Do you have something to tell me? It looks like you've brought something.zts14817e	A letter from Priestess Nora? It will take some time for me to decipher the letter. In the meantime, have a rest.zts14818e	Unfortunately I cannot tell you what's written in this private letter. When Priestess Nora brought the visitor to Aster Temple, there was a terrible accident.zts14819e	Since the accident, High Priest Eladin has been plagued by intense feelings of guilt.zts14820e	Bring the deciphered letter to High Priest Eladin. Perhaps it will help to relieve him of his guilty feelings.zts14821e	Did you light some incense sticks for Priestess Nora?zts14822e	Every day I think about what would have happened if it had been me who'd gone to Aster Temple and not her. She would still be alive and I wouldn't have all this guilt. I suppose it's time I let it go.zts14823e	Thanks to your help, she's been able to go to the Sun God. May God's blessing be with you!zts14824e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Relic of Ideaszts14825e	You can see antique characters on the relics. They seem to be made of clay. Judging by the emblem, they are one of the treasures of Aster Temple. Maybe High Priest Eladin knows something about the relics.zts14826e	Do you have something for me? If so, then let me look at it more closely.zts14827e	These are relics of Grenigas, the fire god. One moment, I will just look up some more information about that.zts14828e	This is a piece of the relic of Grenigas, the fire god. You found it in Aster Temple, didn't you? Ever since the relic was broken, great chaos has prevailed here.zts14829e	I need to find a solution to the problem, and I need someone to take over some of my tasks. Go inside Aster Temple and collect the pieces of the relic of the god Grenigas. In the meantime, I will try to find out how we can put the relic back together.zts14830e	After you've collected the relic pieces, bring them to Priestess Vera.zts14831e	I've heard that you're looking for the relic pieces. Have you been able to find any yet?zts14832e	I'll begin to reassemble the relic immediately!zts14833e	I need the missing pieces in order to reassemble the relic completely. They must be somewhere inside Aster Temple. Go there and look for the rest of the relic pieces.zts14834e	Did you find any relic pieces in the underground caves?zts14835e	Now I can continue reassembling the relic. There haven't been any difficulties yet.zts14836e	The reassembly of the relic is proceeding smoothly. It's not enough to just put the pieces together; we need to transfer a magic force onto the relics as well. I'm still looking for a magic book that will reveal to me how this works. But first, I still need the remaining relic pieces from the temple.zts14837e	Are you making any progress in the search for the relic pieces?zts14838e	I think we've nearly finished with this.zts14839e	There's only one more piece needed to finish reassembling the relic. You will probably be able to find it in Aster Centre. Be especially careful this timezts14840e	Have you brought the relic piece?zts14841e	The relic is almost completely reassembled.zts14842e	(Grenigas' relic begins to glow.)zts14843e	The relic is completely reassembled. Bring this report to High Priest Eladin. I have a bad feeling about all this. Something terrible is in store for us.zts14844e	How are things going with Grenigas' relic?zts14845e	We still can't do much with Grenigas' relics, but some day they will be of great help to us. Until that day comes, we shall keep them safe here.zts14846e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Disappearance of the Investigatorzts14847e	For some time now, we haven't received any news from the treasure hunter we sent to Rashid Temple. The Treasure Hunter Camp is responsible for the safety of all its employees.zts14848e	Unfortunately we don't have enough people to begin a rescue operation. Can you help us with this issue?zts14849e	Go to Serena and speak with her about the missing treasure hunter. She knows where he was staying last and might have more information to help with rescuing him.zts14850e	So, this is about the missing treasure hunter that needs rescuing?zts14851e	We're really very busy. The Burning Sword, the problems at Aster Temple, the Desert Robbers... we're stretched to our limit at Treasure Hunter Camp.zts14852e	Do you think you could maybe help us this one time? According to our information, the report prepared by the explorers has been stolen by the Desert Robbers and taken to Garton's Camp.zts14853e	Please recover the Rashid Temple report for us.zts14854e	Have you found it?zts14855e	It looks like they were doing some investigations in Rashid Temple.zts14856e	We need to find out what the treasure hunters were exploring. However, the Desert Robbers have stolen another part of the report on the temple. They were supposed to bring it to the Temple Path.zts14857e	Go there and subdue the Desert Robbers. Find the report and take it to Rashid Temple. There you'll find some treasure hunters who need your help. You can bring the report over to us after you've helped them.zts14858e	Get going!zts14859e	Please help us.zts14860e	Someone has finally come to rescue us. I need to rest for a moment, I'm too weak.zts14861e	We are treasure hunters who were sent here to conduct research on the temple. Check out the area around the temple.zts14862e	(Michol points in the direction of the temple.)zts14863e	That is Rashid Temple. The creatures that are currently at the Temple Site came from there. Please keep the monsters at bay until we find a way to stop them appearing.zts14864e	How did it go? Have the monsters stopped attacking?zts14865e	There are less attacks for now at least. Thank you!zts14866e	Before we can leave we need to finish exploring the temple. We'll need your help to continue our research, as we're quite weak already. We had to leave our documents behind when we fled from the monsters. They contain important information.zts14867e	What about the tablets? They're very important.zts14868e	Be careful with them. They're valuable relics that contain important information about our history.zts14869e	With help from you adventurers, we will need to bring the injured treasure hunters back to Desert Eagle City so that they can be attended to. We should collect all the research documents and bring them with us.zts14870e	This bag contains the gathered documents and a detailed report about what happened. Bring them to Serena at the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts14871e	Are the missing explorers okay? What happened? Please tell me.zts14872e	That's amazing. I'm going to send more adventurers to rescue my people at the temple site.zts14873e	Now that we've discovered the temple site, we'll be exploring it further. Our research will bring us prestige, and we should be proud of it. Michol's report contains important information about your deeds. We are very grateful for your help.zts14874e	My final request is to please bring this to Riana.zts14875e	What's the matter? If you're bored here, perhaps it's best if you go somewhere else.zts14876e	So, you found the missing treasure hunter. Please tell me what happened.zts14877e	If Serena's already taken care of it, then I don't need any further explanation.zts14878e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and Exploring the Temple Sitezts14879e	Thanks to your help, we can plan many more investigations. Research on the temple is of great importance to the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts14880e	I'll set about organising these documents. In the meantime, you should begin your investigations. We've uncovered some strange ruins. Go there and tell me what you find.zts14881e	And? Did you find anything out?zts14882e	The sand monsters were created with the help of magic. We'll have to consider what we should do now.zts14883e	We've found more ruins to the north of the temple site. We haven't been able to get inside the temple since we arrived because this one is in very bad condition. So we haven't been able to gather any complete relics.zts14884e	Have a good look around and deal with any monsters you come across.zts14885e	Are the investigations running smoothly?zts14886e	You look exhausted. Have a rest before you continue.zts14887e	Are the investigations running smoothly?zts14888e	Have I told you about Rashid Temple before? That's where the monsters are coming from.zts14889e	(Michol points to the damaged temple.)zts14890e	Getting rid of the monsters near the temple will allow us to investigate the place in safety.zts14891e	Deal with the creatures near Rashid Temple.zts14892e	Is the investigation finished?zts14893e	Our investigations are getting more complicated, I'm afraid.zts14894e	Some of the treasure hunters are wounded. They lost their reports as they fled from huge monsters. The monsters are apparently near Rashid Temple. Please defeat them and bring us back the reports.zts14895e	How did it go? Do you have the reports?zts14896e	Good. Now we have the majority of our documents back.zts14897e	The documents also contain detailed information about the sand monsters. The descriptions must be part of the many documents concerning the temple.zts14898e	Bring the documents to Serena in the Treasure Hunter Camp. She'll be able to use them to decide if we should send more treasure hunters to us.zts14899e	You'll receive rewards for your efforts from her.zts14900e	I'm really very busy. I have so many documents to work on that I have no time left for anything else. And then you come here bringing me more of them!zts14901e	I must do my best for the hard-working treasure hunters.zts14902e	I've reorganized the treasure hunters' documents. If I'd left them how Michol gave them to me, Riana wouldn't have read them. It wouldn't have made any sense to give them to her.zts14903e	Riana will give you your reward. She doesn't do much work, but then again she's the one responsible for the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts14904e	How can I help you?zts14905e	The report is well organised.zts14906e	I prefer working outside so I don't like hanging about in the Treasure Hunter Camp for too long. However, I broke my promise to Serena and bought some relics, so I'm obliged to stay here.zts14907e	Here is your reward. The Treasure Hunter Camp doesn't have much in the way of treasure at the moment. But I hope you will take this symbol of our gratitude, all the same.zts14908e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the True Nature of the Temple Sitezts14909e	This time I'm asking you to find an important relic. It's a tablet containing important information about the fire god Grenigas.zts14910e	The relic is made up of several stone tablets. First head north of the well and have a look around. The other treasure hunters suspect that one of the tablets may be there.zts14911e	Were the stone tablets where we thought they'd be?zts14912e	The tablet is written in an ancient language... It appears to be an original tablet. Thank you very much for your help!zts14913e	To be honest, I have to confess that I'm not at all fluent in the ancient language written on the tablet. I'm merely responsible for the excavations. My knowledge of the language really only stretches as far as recognising the shape of the letters.zts14914e	Our top priority is to collect these artefacts, so let's start looking for the next tablet. We'll send the ones we've already collected to the Treasure Hunter Camp to be examined.zts14915e	Please go and explore the area Northwest of the well now. If you find something then bring it straight to me.zts14916e	Have you brought me a stone tablet?zts14917e	Fantastic! I'm going to keep the tablets here for now.zts14918e	You'll find the last tablet near Rashid Temple. It looks so very similar to Aster Temple. I wonder if they're connected somehow?zts14919e	Almost finished examining the tablet. Let's keep doing our best!zts14920e	Did you find any tablets in Rashid Temple? In any case, the sand monsters didn't have the chance to destroy them.zts14921e	Have we really collected every tablet? Have you seen any other ones?zts14922e	That's strange. Even though we searched virtually everywhere in the Temple Site, there's still a stone tablet missing. But I think there are other monsters out apart from the ones made of sand.zts14923e	It's only a hunch, but I think these monsters must be in possession of the last stone tablet. Hurry, because we can only find out what's written on the tablets once we have all of them.zts14924e	What about the tablet? Did you find it?zts14925e	Well done, now we can finish our research on the tablets.zts14926e	Take the tablets we found to the Treasure Hunter Camp. I've already asked Serena to do a more thorough examination of the tablets. Maybe she can give you some information about the artefacts we've already sent there.zts14927e	There were a few incidents, but I think we were able to gather up the tablets without any major losses. Thank you for your help! I hope you have a pleasant journey to Desert Eagle City.zts14928e	You've apparently got the stone tablet with you.zts14929e	I can already tell you quite a lot about the tablets. Why not have a little rest.zts14930e	The tablets recount the legend of the fire god Grenigas.zts14931e	It's a mythical story, but unfortunately I can't find anything about the temple site in it.zts14932e	I'm summarized the contents of the tablets in this report. Please bring it to Riana.zts14933e	Do you have the report? Can I see it quickly?zts14934e	The Legend of the fire god Grenigas... this is of great scientific value. I think this means we'll be able to sell these artefacts at a high price. That would help improve the financial situation of our camp a little.zts14935e	This time we can afford to reward you a little more handsomely.zts14936e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Guardian of Rashid Templezts14937e	Rashid Temple is one of the best preserved temples in existence. Exploring it is therfore of great importance. Unfortunately it's not safe because of the countless monsters there.zts14938e	Please deal with the monsters for us, so we can continue our research. Go to Rashid Temple and fight the creatures there. Begin in the temple courtyard.zts14939e	Did you investigate the library as well?zts14940e	Were the monsters inside Rashid Temple also made of sand?zts14941e	I was in Rashid Temple once a long time ago. There's a place deep inside it called Rashid Courtyard. It was there that we examined some relics. Back then the monsters you've described were not there yet. You should begin your investigations there.zts14942e	The next place that needs investigating is at the back of Rashid Courtyard. Please get rid of the creatures there.zts14943e	Have the monsters in the underground caves been totally removed?zts14944e	It seems Rashid Courtyard has been purged to a reasonable extent.zts14945e	I suspect the creatures in Rashid Temple are guarding something. What I need you to do is prove my theory.zts14946e	We have to continue exploring, regardless of any problems that come up. We should focus on the centre of the temple next.zts14947e	Please go to Aster Centre and eliminate as many monsters as you can so I can send the treasure hunters there. Only then can we continue our research in peace.zts14948e	How are you? Are you all right? Tell me what happened in the prayer hall.zts14949e	I'm very grateful! But we're not finished exploring the temple yet.zts14950e	After you got rid of so many monsters in the centre, I sent a reconnaissance patrol out to the neighbouring area to gather some information. It's very dangerous there, so be careful.zts14951e	There are dangerous monsters there who are jeopardising our research. So there's a lot of work for you to do out there.zts14952e	The monsters you need to defeat are in the Rashid Centre.zts14953e	How did it go with those dangerous monsters? Were you able to defeat them?zts14954e	It's a tricky situation. Too many strange things are happening in Rashid Temple. I'd like to thank you for assisting us with our research.zts14955e	Thanks to your hard work Rashid Temple is secure and we can continue our research. This is a step forward in the right direction.zts14956e	Bring this report to Serena at the Treasure Hunter Camp. I've written you a commendation in my report, so this time you should receive a special reward.zts14957e	It's been a long journey. Aren't you exhausted?zts14958e	Please rest until I've finished reading the latest report.zts14959e	The sand monsters are truly frightening. If only we knew where they come from. Are they guarding something in Rashid Temple?zts14960e	The report for Riana is ready. Please deliver it to her. Of course she'll probably ask you to describe some of the things you've experienced to her yourself.zts14961e	She'll probably be so fascinated that she'll want to accompany you on your next adventures.zts14962e	Just leave the report here.zts14963e	What was it like out there, in real life? Please tell me all about it! If I weren't stuck here in the Treasure Hunter Camp, I'd join you right away and explore like the others.zts14964e	I'll take into account the danger you put yourself in for the treasure hunters, and reward you accordingly.zts14965e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Relic of Rashid Templezts14966e	There are several investigations to be carried out at Rashid Temple.zts14967e	It mostly involves searching for lost relics or studying the mysterious creatures living inside.zts14968e	This time we'll be looking for relics by searching Rashid Temple one area at a time. First, go to the courtyard and get me the relics from the monsters living there.zts14969e	Were you able to find any relics in the library?zts14970e	Excellent work! I'll keep them safe here for now.zts14971e	Rashid Temple is very similar to Aster Temple. That's where I trained to be a treasure hunter. However, no one knows where these temples come from.zts14972e	But enough of that! Back to the topic at hand. You need to head off to the next area in Rashid Temple. Defeat the monsters at the back of the courtyard and gather the relic pieces.zts14973e	Were you able to get the relics from the underground caves?zts14974e	You've found the relic pieces! Thank you!zts14975e	Some of the relics are in better condition than I anticipated.zts14976e	The monsters have most of the relic pieces. They seem to be attacking so aggressively because they are protecting the relic pieces. But we can't let that stop our research.zts14977e	Once you've regained your strength, bring me the relic pieces from the monsters in Rashid Centre.zts14978e	How is collecting the relic pieces from the Prayer Hall going?zts14979e	Very good! Our investigations will be complete much quicker than I had anticipated.zts14980e	Now there's only one place left from which we need to collect relic pieces... Rashid Centre. It's very dangerous there, so be cautious.zts14981e	We have to continue exploring, regardless of any problems that come up. Keep collecting relic pieces in the centre of the temple. As soon as we've finished investigating we'll be able to breathe again.zts14982e	Do you have the relic pieces?zts14983e	Now that the relic is complete, our investigation is finished. The treasure hunters at the Treasure Hunter Camp will make a thorough analysis of the relics.zts14984e	This bag contains all of the relic pieces collected in the temple.zts14985e	Please take it to the Treasure Hunter Camp. As usual, you can get your reward from there. But after that you should have a rest - you've worked very hard.zts14986e	You've done such a good job! Have a good trip!zts14987e	Have you just come from Rashid Temple?zts14988e	I've been expecting you. The relic pieces are in very good condition. The Rashid Temple relics need careful examination as they provide us with a key to understanding the ancients and their civilization.zts14989e	They're different from the relics we've found before. They contain important information for us treasure hunters.zts14990e	The treasure hunters have already analysed the relics. The report is very well organised.zts14991e	Whether that's a good or a bad sign is for Riana to decide.zts14992e	Bring Riana this report on the relic pieces.zts14993e	What? Another report already?zts14994e	The reports have been piling up on my desk a lot lately. I'm starting to lose sight of the big picture!zts14995e	I'm tired and should really take a break, but I still have to read all these reports. Before I forget, take this reward with the treasure hunters' gratitude.zts14996e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Secret of Rashid Templezts14997e	We've found a great many relics inside Rashid Temple. The temple is the ideal starting point for our investigations. Unfortunately, the monsters prowling about inside the temple are giving us more and more problems.zts14998e	It's even possible that the creatures have destroyed some of the temple's relics. Please go and find them and bring them back here.zts14999e	Begin your search at the front of Rashid Courtyard.zts15000e	Do you have any relics on you?zts15001e	Thank you very much! The treasure hunters in the Treasure Hunter Camp are responsible for reassembling the broken tablets.zts15002e	There are fewer treasure hunters in the Treasure Hunter Camp than you'd think. Most people there are adventurers, like yourself.zts15003e	We've handed out the tasks to multiple groups, so we should be making much quicker progress now. The first group is responsible for eliminating the monsters, the second for finding the relics, and the third for transporting them to the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts15004e	This time you'll need to go and collect the relics in Rashid Courtyard so that we can get them ready to be transported.zts15005e	Are you making much progress?zts15006e	They're in good condition.zts15007e	The centre of Rashid Temple shouldn't present much danger anymore. It's the next place we have to investigate.zts15008e	Sometimes we don't have enough brave adventurers to get rid of the monsters, which makes our research very difficult. I don't think that should be a problem this time. But be careful anyway!zts15009e	And? Do you have any relics with you?zts15010e	We're lucky everything has gone so well!zts15011e	The last thing we need is the broken tablet from the back of Rashid Centre.zts15012e	I have received information that vicious monsters are prowling about there. Of course, it's not safe for the treasure hunters if there are monsters around, but they shouldn't present you with much of a challenge. That's why we need your help for this last investigation.zts15013e	We cannot allow our research to be affected by such things. Go to Rashid Centre now.zts15014e	Good, I'm glad you're back safe.zts15015e	You found my knapsack! I lost it when the monsters started making trouble. I will never forget this!zts15016e	I remember exactly what happened. I had been sent here with a mysterious traveller by the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts15017e	To begin with I was happy not to have to travel alone and I didn't feel like they got in the way of my research. But once we arrived here, the traveller stole one of the relics and ran off. I didn't see them again after that. It was a very valuable relic. That's why it's so important to take the relics safely to the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts15018e	Take this knapsack to Serena in the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts15019e	Are you having any success exploring Rashid Temple?zts15020e	Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could discover all the relics' secrets!zts15021e	It will take a little more time to thoroughly examine the relics. The story of this mysterious traveller is interesting. Without his help, we wouldn't have found the temple site. His information was very advantageous to us.zts15022e	But it still annoys me that he stole one of the fire god relics. You don't need to concern yourself with that, though, now you've finished this.zts15023e	Take this report to Riana. It may not look like it, but she'll find it interesting.zts15024e	What's the matter? I'm busy, very busy! So if you need to tell me something, make it quick!zts15025e	These reports just keep piling up! But your report looks interesting. Just put it down here. The treasure hunters are very grateful for your help.zts15026e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and a Man Named Xavierzts15027e	Would you like to make yourself useful in the Chaos Zone? Don't you think it's pointless?zts15028e	If you're not too busy, do me a favour. I'm going to give you a very important letter to bring to Velmon in the Chaos Zone. The letter says that he has to finally settle his drinking debts. He's an old friend of mine, so he'll do what I ask him right away.zts15029e	Who are you? Are you assisting the Chaos Zone patrol?zts15030e	So Xavier sent you?zts15031e	Xavier used to be a very ambitious person. But after being kicked out of our organisation, it seems his ambition has somewhat waned. After getting himself drunk every day, he's no longer willing to perform work of any kind. I do hope he finds his lust for life again.zts15032e	I recently learned a few magic spells from a travelling sorcerer. It should help reawaken a love for life. I would like to try them out on Xavier.zts15033e	For this spell, I'm going to need a few things. What you could get for me is a mysterious ingredient called Sand Spirit Essence.zts15034e	I think you can get it easily from the monsters in the Chaos Environment. Can you manage that?zts15035e	It is said that every living thing in Mortaz Desert carries this essence within it, but the essence of the monsters is supposed to be especially valuable.zts15036e	Have you brought the sand spirit essence?zts15037e	Of course, I can't say with any certainty if this really is Sand Spirit Essence. But since you've taken the effort to bring it to me, I'll use it as an ingredient for the spells.zts15038e	Could you also bring me some Wind Spirit Essence? Like the Sand Spirit Essence, it's something that drives every living thing. You should have a pretty high chance of finding it in the Chaos Environment.zts15039e	However, you should be able to find a lot of Wind Spirit Essence in the Lost Desert. Since I'm not particularly well versed in magic, I usually ask the adventurers who pass by here whether they have information for me.zts15040e	Now make your way to the Lost Desert and bring me back the Wind Spirit Essence.zts15041e	The wind spirit essence... Did you find it yet?zts15042e	So that's the Wind Spirit Essence... I think this should be enough for the spell.zts15043e	That should be all of the ingredients. There's only one more thing I need. We need to mix the ingredients with some rum so that Xavier won't notice.zts15044e	Not long ago I ordered some expensive Port Alveus rum from the Akamur Merchants. We could use it for this.zts15045e	Unfortunately, there's just one little problem: the Desert Robbers have stolen it. It's probably in Garton's Camp. There's supposedly some Fairy Dust there as well. You might as well bring them both with you.zts15046e	Since our patrol doesn't have the manpower to send to Garton's Camp, I'm going to have to ask you to show your full dedication once more.zts15047e	Did you search Garton's Camp thoroughly? If the Akamur Merchants' are to be believed, it really should be at his camp.zts15048e	That's Xavier's favourite rum.zts15049e	I've mixed together the Sand and Wind Fairy Essences and added a sprinkling of Fairy Dust to it. I'll leave the stirring up to you.zts15050e	When you're finished stirring it, go to High Priest Eladin at Aster Temple. He'll be able to complete the spell. Put the mixture in this container and go. There are a few other things in there I'd like to send to Eladin. But please don't go rummaging about in them.zts15051e	My old friend Velmon needs my help and sent you here. Did he give you something for me?zts15052e	Do the contents of this container have something to do with you?zts15053e	(High Priest Eladin takes the rum from the container and mumbles something to himself.)zts15054e	It's a very special charm. The rum is for Xavier in the Chaos Zone, isn't it? I hope that this makes the darkness in his heart disappear. But whether or not his attitude changes is up to him.zts15055e	Take the rum to Semia in the Akamur Quarter. She'll wrap up the rum nicely, as per Velmon's orders.zts15056e	Welcome to the Akamur Merchants' headquarters.zts15057e	So this is the rum. Is it enough to embellish it with the Akamur Merchants Emblem??zts15058e	Now take the rum to Xavier in the Chaos Zone. Hopefully it will heal him of his depression.zts15059e	I see this favour as a first step of sorts towards cementing ties with the Chaos Zone. We need to be friendly with one another so we can all live peacefully in Desert Eagle City.zts15060e	Now go to the Chaos Zone.zts15061e	Why did that take so long?zts15062e	That's just what I need right now! Oh, how I've longed for some rum! If it comes from Port Alveus, it must have been expensive.zts15063e	It's delicious! Simply heavenly!zts15064e	(Xavier seems to be in the best of moods, he begins to sing, before suddenly collapsing.) It would be best to report this to Velmon.zts15065e	How's Xavier doing?zts15066e	Thanks a lot. I'm sure he'll feel a lot better when he wakes up.zts15067e	This reward isn't from the patrol, but from my own pocket. I know it's probably less than you were expecting, but I hope you accept it anyway. It's still something special.zts15068e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Letter to the Desert Robber Leaderzts15069e	This letter is incomplete. It's missing some sections that we will need to be able to read it.zts15070e	The missing pieces of the letter are without a doubt in the hands of the Desert Robbers in Keru's Camp.zts15071e	The robbers at Garton's Camp might also have some of the missing pieces.zts15072e	After you've collected all the letter fragments, bring them to Semia in the Akamur Quarter. She'll be able to give you more information.zts15073e	Is there anything I can help you with?zts15074e	(Semia puts together the letter fragments.) It's a letter to the Leader of the Desert Robbers. How did you get this letter?zts15075e	It looks like it's a secret Desert Robbers letter. But something is strange about it.zts15076e	I'll give you the task of investigating this letter. There is someone who knows the Desert Robbers well. His name is Velmon, and you'll find him in the Chaos Zone.zts15077e	There's something else you should know. This mission is strictly confidential. Your official task will be to go to the Lost Desert and hunt monsters. Once you've defeated the creatures, you'll be able to go to the Chaos Zone unnoticed and ask Velmon about the Desert Robbers' letter.zts15078e	What's the matter? What brings you here?zts15079e	Hm... I think I might know who wrote this letter.zts15080e	I also know who this letter is written to. But I can't just tell you like that.zts15081e	It would mean betraying this person's trust. Until I know whether they would want to meet you, I'm not telling you their name. Only the people living in the Chaos Zone know them.zts15082e	If you really want me to tell you, you'll have to prove to the people living in the Chaos Zone that you're trustworthy.zts15083e	I can give you a task right away. Get rid of the monsters in the Chaos Zone.zts15084e	Is it going to take much longer?zts15085e	Very good! You'd make a good patrol member with those skills. Are you interested in that? I know you're an adventurer, and that's what you're best at.zts15086e	But hear me out a moment. I'm going to tell you a little about myself.zts15087e	Before coming here, I was a Desert Robber. My life wasn't bad. Justice and freedom were the most important things to me. Then one day, a mysterious traveller made a proposition to the Desert Robbers. What he said was ridiculous, and that's why my leader and I declined. But because of that we were thrown out of our group. Unfortunately, I can't tell you any more.zts15088e	Over there you'll find the former Desert Robber Leader. His name is Xavier. Bring him this rum and ask him about this letter.zts15089e	What? Is this something to do with me? If not, I'd rather you left me in peace.zts15090e	Oh! Is that my favourite rum I spy?zts15091e	So, what's this about? Do you need my help?zts15092e	Oh yeah, this letter is for me. When I was leader of the Desert Robbers, secret messages were always encrypted in this way.zts15093e	Would you like to know what it says?zts15094e	Well, since you brought me my favourite rum, I'll tell you what the letter says. Someone called Kamil is waiting ever so patiently for me to return, even though I was thrown out of the Desert Robbers. They want to overthrow the current leader, Ibrahim.zts15095e	But I really don't have any interest in their schemes.zts15096e	What did he say? Is something going on with the Desert Robbers?zts15097e	I can imagine what he said about the letter.zts15098e	Did the Akamur Merchants send you here? To gather information about Xavier? I can tell when you're hiding something from me. Please don't tell the Akamur Merchants about Xavier's true identity. If they found out, relations with Desert Eagle City would drastically deteriorate.zts15099e	We are very grateful for your efforts in trying to keep the peace in the Chaos Zone. Please take this as a reward.zts15100e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Ways of the Desert Robberszts15101e	I'm afraid I don't have much to tell you about the Desert Robbers. I'm just a drunken old man.zts15102e	If you want to know about the Desert Robbers, go talk to Velmon in the Chaos Zone. He'll be able to tell you more. I'll give you a letter for you to give to him, so he knows to tell you everything you want to know.zts15103e	And next time you come back here, bring me something to drink! I'm out of rum and I don't have the money to buy myself more.zts15104e	What is it? Is that letter you're carrying for me?zts15105e	That's Xavier's handwriting. What reason do you have for coming here?zts15106e	I'm afraid I can't pay for the alcohol that Xavier's asking for. I'm completely stretched with my current responsibilities as it is. At the moment I can hardly pay the Chaos Zone guards. You could do a little work for me if you want to help me get out of this awkward situation.zts15107e	Currently, dangerous monsters are threatening the Chaos Zone. It's only a matter of time before they penetrate our defences. Please get rid of the monsters and give us some much needed peace.zts15108e	Are you having any success with your mission to defeat the monsters?zts15109e	You really are talented!zts15110e	It looks like the Desert Robbers were responsible for the monsters that attacked the Chaos Zone. So I have an urgent assignment for you. Will you help us?zts15111e	Go to the Desert Robber Camp and speak to Rushaldin immediately. He knows all about this and will give you further instructions. I'm going to give you a letter for him.zts15112e	Who sent you?zts15113e	Did Velmon send you? Then I can breathe again.zts15114e	You seem to be talented. I like adventurers like you - you're always a great help to me. What would you like to know about the Desert Robbers? I'm just a warrior, but I know someone who might be able to help you.zts15115e	(You hear noises from something unknown nearby.)zts15116e	Oh no! Someone's been listening to our conversation! If the leader finds out about it, I'll be in deep trouble. And you're no longer safe here either.zts15117e	Go, take out the nearby robbers!zts15118e	Have you gotten rid of whoever was listening in on us?zts15119e	Since the alarm hasn't been raised, you must've got the eavesdropper.zts15120e	Let's continue the story. I know who you're looking for. His name is Kamil. He's been imprisoned in Aster Temple for a while now. He used to be one of Ibrahim's followers, but one day he tried to overthrow him. This is why he was locked up.zts15121e	Kamil is imprisoned in the Robber Courtyard. Be careful, the robbers have positioned really well trained guards there. So if you value you life, make sure you're well prepared.zts15122e	Who's there? Did Velmon send you here to help me? What did the leader say? Can you get me out of here?zts15123e	Oh. So you weren't sent by our leader?zts15124e	That's okay... The resistance isn't going to break that easily. We'll find a new way. We won't rest until we've reached our goal.zts15125e	I'll give you some information on the Desert Robbers, but I want you to provide some support for the resistance. The guards around the Aster Temple here are really leader Ibrahim's men. They need to be cleared out of the way so the people in our resistance can carry out their plans.zts15126e	Once you've completed this task, I'll tell you what we're going to do next.zts15127e	Is everything all right? You look unharmed.zts15128e	I'm surprised how easily you've completed this task. And completing it without a scratch as well.zts15129e	We Desert Robbers have a saying: Deeds are louder than words. We always strive to put this into practice. Now that you have helped us, we are comrades. You've successfully eliminated the guards.zts15130e	Next you should take out Shoran and Shay, since they're important commanders. Their removal would put us at a great advantage. If you have any problems carrying out your mission, ask some friends for help.zts15131e	How did it go? Have you defeated Commanders Shoran and Shay? They're really strong and are counted among Ibrahim's most loyal followers.zts15132e	You abilities never cease to amaze me! Thanks to you, the Seal of the Desert Robbers is safely ours once more.zts15133e	The seal must be brought back to its rightful owner.zts15134e	We hope our former leader will return to us once we bring him this seal. Only then can the Desert Robbers take the right path once more. The problem is I don't know where our leader is. Some say he's in the Chaos Zone.zts15135e	Bring the seal to Velmon - he'll know where to find our leader and will give it to him.zts15136e	What's the matter? Isn't that the Seal of the Desert Robbers? How is it that you have it?zts15137e	You bringing me the seal, it's a sign. I always trusted Kamil, but I would like to tell him that his deeds are not very well thought out.zts15138e	But it's still my duty to report Kamil's intentions to the former leader.zts15139e	Take the seal to Xavier, and you'll want to take this expensive rum too. He's sitting over there, drunk on the ground.zts15140e	The Seal of the Desert Robbers belongs to him.zts15141e	What's the matter? Didn't I tell you I need a rest?! Leave me alone!zts15142e	This is very expensive rum. The best rum I've ever tasted. And it's for me? Haha! Thank you! What else have you brought me?zts15143e	(Xavier takes the seal and throws it far away.)zts15144e	None of this makes any sense! I still have enough rum, so take this back!zts15145e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Time for Defencezts15146e	The Akamur Merchants are responsible for the administration and security of Desert Eagle City. Nevertheless, the residents of the Chaos Zone have to take care of themselves.zts15147e	But right now we don't have enough personnel to guarantee security or proper administration. That's why I'd like to ask you to help us. Since we're receiving a certain amount of support from the Akamur Merchants, we can also reward you appropriately.zts15148e	Please defeat the creatures in the Lost Desert and in the Chaos Zone.zts15149e	How's it going? Are you making much progress?zts15150e	It's the duty of the patrol to provide security for the residents of the Chaos Zone.zts15151e	You've carried out your task successfully. You should be proud of yourself.zts15152e	We've learned that our security problems have to do with the Desert Robbers. I've decided I can't let them get away with this. That's why we, the Chaos Zone Patrol, have decided together with the Akamur Merchants to attack the Desert Robbers.zts15153e	What you need to do is the following: head south of the Akamur Camp to Keru's Camp and attack it. You need to eliminate the Desert Robbers, but most importantly, take out Commander Keru himself.zts15154e	What happened at Keru's Camp? They must be rendered harmless so they can never endanger the Chaos Zone again.zts15155e	A very satisfying accomplishment. However our security troubles aren't behind us yet.zts15156e	Our next destination is Garton's Camp. I hope you're aware that we cannot currently deal with the area around Mortaz Desert Harbour.zts15157e	We think that defeating the Desert Robbers is the only important thing. They are a danger to the Chaos Zone.zts15158e	Same as before, but this time you're going to attack Garton's Camp. Garton is a rather powerful commander, so make sure you're on your guard.zts15159e	And the robbers in Garton's Camp are not easy to fight, but I'm sure you already know that.zts15160e	The way we see it, this attack was the best solution.zts15161e	But it's not like we haven't tried the diplomatic way. While you were gone, we tried to resolve the issue by peaceful means, but their response wasn't exactly as we would have liked.zts15162e	I will never forget what you have done for us. The residents of the Chaos Zone will always hold you in high regard.zts15163e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Desert Robber Schismzts15164e	(Some parts of this entry have been ripped out. One part is still legible.)zts15165e	Entry #23:zts15166e	The Desert Robbers have occupied Aster Temple. Surprisingly, they seem to have good relations with the Akamur Merchants. I have to find a way to put an end to this friendship. We also need to ensure that adventurers keep their distance from that place in the future.zts15167e	Show it to Kamil, maybe he can make something of it.zts15168e	What's the matter? What do you have there?zts15169e	It's the diary of a traveller. This is the first time I've seen anything like it.zts15170e	The traveller that owned this diary, was obviously the cause for the conflict between the Desert Robbers and the Akamur Merchants.zts15171e	We Desert Robbers use Fairy Dust to rid ourselves of bad thoughts and emotions. That keeps us from doing evil deeds. Most Desert Robbers have some fairy dust on them. Please check if the robbers are still using it and collect some. You'll need a special bag to gather the fairy dust. You can find that bag around here somewhere. After that, get going and collect the dust.zts15172e	Were you able to find the fairy dust? Do they really still use it?zts15173e	So does that mean the Desert Robber Camp doesn't guard their fairy dust supply?zts15174e	I never expected that, how startling! This means that this Traveller had more to hide than we previously assumed.zts15175e	We should start with our next investigation at once. I really would like to help you with it, but I'm simply not in a state to do so at the moment. I'm very sorry, but do you think you can carry out this investigation for me?zts15176e	The guards in the former Aster Temple are much more loyal to Ibrahim than the rest of the Desert Robbers. We have to find out the reason for this first of all. Just what is it that makes them so loyal? Perhaps they've been given something which is causing this?zts15177e	Go now with some reliable companions and take out the Desert Robber guards so that we can find out what they're carrying. If it's something like the bag used to store Fairy Dust, bring it to us if possible.zts15178e	Were you able to find anything? If my suspicions are correct, then something terrible's about to happen.zts15179e	You found this with the Desert Robbers? Perhaps we can use this to cause a little unrest in the ranks of the Desert Robbers.zts15180e	Some Desert Robbers say they cannot stand to take any more orders from our leader Ibrahim.zts15181e	One of them is representative Rushaldin, a good friend of Velmon's. Please bring the evidence you've collected to him in the Desert Robber Camp. He'll know what we have to do next.zts15182e	Get going! Rushaldin is expecting you!zts15183e	Are you the one who got in contact with Kamil?zts15184e	I've already received many reports about you and your deeds. Rest a bit and I'll think about what we should do next.zts15185e	The Desert Robbers are under some magical influence, just as Kamil and I suspected. They aren't in control of their actions anymore!zts15186e	The traveller is responsible for the Desert Robbers' problems. He's working with Ibrahim and pulling strings in the background. We're going to have to make a new plan.zts15187e	But that'll have to wait. I'm currently very busy.zts15188e	Go now to the Chaos Zone and bring all of this evidence to Velmon.zts15189e	Oh, it's you. What brings you here?zts15190e	Apparently Rushaldin knows how we should proceed.zts15191e	I'm good friends with Rushaldin. We were once comrades in the Desert Robbers, before I was thrown out of the group. I wish he'd leave them as well.zts15192e	But the time hasn't come for that yet. We have to find whoever's responsible for this before the Desert Robbers get any stronger.zts15193e	Bring this letter from Rushaldin to Xavier in the Chaos Zone. He definitely needs to know about this.zts15194e	I need alcohol. Got anything to drink?zts15195e	(Xavier reads the letter and makes a face.)zts15196e	Bah... This doesn't look very good. Now, let me just give you a token of my gratitude for coming here and reporting this to me...zts15197e	This is some of the money I received from the Akamur Merchants. Thank you. We're still going to need your help.zts15198e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword - Every Effect Has a Causezts15199e	Since I've been captured here, I don't know what things are like with the Desert Robbers on the inside, nor do I know what they're planning. It seems that they think I won't be able to cause any trouble as long as they don't give me any information.zts15200e	That's why I'm asking you to do some investigating for me.zts15201e	It's not a big deal. Take out the robbers at the exit of the Desert Robber Camp and report to me on the prevailing atmosphere there. I think it'd be a good idea to search the tents in the south-west.zts15202e	How did it go? Or have you not even left yet?zts15203e	Very good! As long as they're occupied dealing with the Akamur Merchants' trade goods, we can carry out our investigations undisturbed. We're going to need to prepare for a real battle soon.zts15204e	The next operation has something to do with the Desert Robbers' resistance movement.zts15205e	Of course we've made careful preparations for this. Now go to the tents in the south-east of the Desert Robber Camp and search them. I'm afraid you won't be able to avoid taking out a few robbers this time either.zts15206e	Do you really think the Desert Robbers are that easy to beat? We need all the help we can get.zts15207e	Do you have a request of me? Or is there something you want to say to me?zts15208e	Good. The investigations will continue of course, but we'll have to be patient.zts15209e	This time we should investigate the area near the entrance to the Desert Robber Camp. I'm curious how they'll react.zts15210e	If they aren't too dense, they'll probably be rather surprised. Please continue with the investigations whatever happens. I'm sure they're up to no good.zts15211e	I think it'd be a good idea if we were to examine the location where they keep their prisoners. At the same time, we should have a look through Representative Rushaldin's tent.zts15212e	Did you find anything unusual there?zts15213e	The situation is worse than I thought. It's going to be difficult to take this any further. However, our efforts haven't been without some use.zts15214e	While you were out investigating, some other adventurers came by here and shared some important information with me.zts15215e	The Desert Robbers are using a certain medicine found somewhere in the Desert Robber Camp. Your task is to find this medicine and examine it.zts15216e	You'd better hurry! It's possible they've already caught on to us.zts15217e	Did you find what you were looking for?zts15218e	Let's think about this calmly. What could these medicine bottles be used for?zts15219e	I'd like to run a few tests on this strange medicine. It's important that we know its effects.zts15220e	Take this medicine bottle to the Desert Robber Camp and use it on a sleeping Desert Robber.zts15221e	Let me know immediately if anything strange happens.zts15222e	How was it? Did you notice anything?zts15223e	Are you serious? They just attacked anyone who approached them?zts15224e	We have to tell Velmon about the Desert Robbers' situation. We still don't even know who's responsible for this.zts15225e	There's only one person who could help us with their Desert Robber contacts. Bring this report to Rushaldin at the Desert Robber Camp.zts15226e	What happened? Why are you so out of breath?zts15227e	This is very disturbing. I'd like to the Desert Robbers' situation to improve, but the report seems to say our efforts are in vain.zts15228e	Hm... I think I may have a solution. But I don't think we can put this plan into effect right away. Bring this letter to Velmon in the Chaos Zone. We need his advice. Please hurry!zts15229e	I assume you've brought something for me.zts15230e	Strange things are happening in the ranks of the Desert Robbers. But I cannot afford to spend my time on their problems right now - my duties to the Chaos Zone come first.zts15231e	I'm in contact with the Akamur Merchants of Desert Eagle City. We're making plans to deal with the threat of the Desert Robbers.zts15232e	I understand what Rushaldin has in mind. Bring this letter over to Xavier.zts15233e	He was always a moral pillar for us Desert Robbers. I think he should know about this.zts15234e	(Velmon points to Xavier, sitting drunk in the sand.)zts15235e	I don't know what kind of story you're about to tell me, but if it's nothing relaxing, please tell me some other time.zts15236e	What do you expect a drunkard like me to do about it?zts15237e	The people that used to follow me have cast me out. What makes you think they'd care about me now? Leave me alone! I'm of no use anymore...zts15238e	Take this and scram!zts15239e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Rescue of the Desert Robberszts15240e	The contents of this bottle look strange. Maybe this a clue to the strange behaviour of the Desert Robbers and their assaults on the Akamur Merchants. Kamil in the Desert Robber Courtyard will know more about this.zts15241e	Am I right in thinking you've got something to show me?zts15242e	This is the clue we've long been looking for.zts15243e	You probably have a lot of questions about this. This prooves that the Desert Robbers have been manipulated by the traveller. The robbers who took this poison have become aggressive and carry out the leader's orders blindly.zts15244e	This is absolutely disgusting. This has destroyed our dreams, and lost us our leader. We have to find a way to reverse the effect of this poison. No one is safe here anymore.zts15245e	Take this bottle of poison to Rushaldin in the Desert Robber Camp.zts15246e	I used to be very influential with the Desert Robbers. This allowed me to see that something just wasn't right.zts15247e	I've always regretted staying here. Especially since Velmon and the leader were thrown out... But the Desert Robbers are very dear to me. Someone has to be here to take care of them.zts15248e	But now it's clear to me that I need to go about this differently. Bring this poison bottle and this letter to Velmon in the Chaos Zone. Maybe he knows how the effects can be reversed.zts15249e	I've heard that Velmon is in charge of training new guards in the Chaos Zone.zts15250e	What is it? Would you like to join the patrol?zts15251e	In recent times, fewer and fewer people have been coming here to join the patrol. This is no doubt Representative Rushaldin's doing.zts15252e	If I understand this letter correctly, the Desert Robbers are under the influence of a poison that makes them act strangely. We have to find a way to help them.zts15253e	Unfortunately I cannot neglect my work here in the Chaos Zone. So I'm going to need your help.zts15254e	This matter is of utmost importance. We need to make sure Xavier knows about this. He'll know what to do.zts15255e	Why are so many damned people after me lately?zts15256e	Oof, I'm not quite sober yet. Speak a little slower for me.zts15257e	I'm sure you're wondering why you keep being sent to a drunkard like me, eh?zts15258e	Well there's no point telling you really. Let's try and find a solution for now.zts15259e	I'm sure it would please Rushaldin if we could make an antidote out of this poison. So let's go and find someone who might be able to do that. Bring this medicine bottle to High Priest Eladin in Aster Temple. He'll be able to use it to brew up an antidote.zts15260e	May the Sun God's blessing be upon you... What's wrong?zts15261e	Even our peaceful temple here has been affected by the Desert Robbers, but I won't deny them my help in their hour of need, all the same.zts15262e	As High Priest of Aster Temple, it is my duty to give aid to those that ask for it. And of course, having known Xavier for a long time, if I can do anything to help him, I will.zts15263e	The poison bottle is an enchanted item. I shall need several ingredients to reverse the effects of the poison. We put in an order with the Akamur Merchants, but the ingredients have yet to arrive at Aster Temple. Go to Semia in the Akamur Quarter and ask her what's happening with our order.zts15264e	What brings you here? Has the order not arrived yet?zts15265e	Aster Temple, Aster Temple... I'll go and have a look.zts15266e	The temple ordered some special essences. It seems like they've been stolen by the Desert Robbers. We already sent some adventurers to retrieve these items, but they haven't returned yet. If you're really in a hurry, perhaps go and search for the lost goods yourself.zts15267e	The items you are looking for were spotted in Keru's Camp and Garton's Camp.zts15268e	Do you have the magical ingredients with you?zts15269e	As this is an urgent matter I shall start working on the antidote right away.zts15270e	Do you mean Rushaldin? I seem to recall he was one of the Desert Robbers. I'm not certain he'll be able to get the problem under control.zts15271e	Sometimes when facing such solid resistance, one is forced to give up. Bring him this antidote. I can only hope it has the desired effect.zts15272e	Tell him that High Priest Eladin sends his blessing.zts15273e	So you're back. Do you have an antidote?zts15274e	I hope this antidote will help us get the Desert Robbers back on the right track.zts15275e	Go to the Desert Robber camp and use the antidote on the sleeping Desert Robbers.zts15276e	This is a very important task. Let's test this antidote as quickly as we can, then hopefully we can get the Desert Robbers back on the right track.zts15277e	How did it go? Did the robber come back to their senses?zts15278e	It worked!zts15279e	Let's hope we're just as successful with the other robbers. We have to stay realistic. We'll know we've won once everyone is free from this poison.zts15280e	In order to see if the antidote really does work, we should get started by trying it out on the sleeping robbers in the Desert Robber Camp.zts15281e	Not ready yet? We don't have much time!zts15282e	It worked again!zts15283e	There's nothing wrong with being careful. We need to be very careful if we're going to see this through to the end. If it works this time as well, we can start putting our plan into motion.zts15284e	This is really very important. Leave as soon as you are ready.zts15285e	How did it go? Did it work?zts15286e	That should be good enough for us to begin with our plan.zts15287e	While you were doing that, I was thinking about what we should do next. I have never been sure whether I should leave the Desert Robbers or not. But I think would never forgive myself if I did. I'll have to do something from within the ranks.zts15288e	Bring this to Kamil in the Robber Courtyard. The time has come to work together.zts15289e	What's representative Rushaldin's opinion of all this?zts15290e	Finally! This is what I've been waiting for.zts15291e	Rushaldin might think it's a good idea the make a new band of Desert Robbers. But we're not going to get very far without our old leader. If we had his help, then perhaps we could convince the other Desert Robbers.zts15292e	I've made up a list of the other Desert Robbers who share our views. Please bring it to Velmon in the Chaos Zone. He'll know where to find our former leader.zts15293e	The Desert Robbers and I thank you for your help.zts15294e	We've been seeing each other a lot lately. What's brought you here this time?zts15295e	Naturally I respect their opinions, but I don't ever want to go back to the Desert Robber Camp. I'm happy with my new life here in the Chaos Zone.zts15296e	I used to be one of them, but that time has long since passed.zts15297e	Since my exile from the Desert Robbers, I have built a new life for myself here in the Chaos Zone. Now this is where I call home, and the other people here have accepted me. Xavier lives here as well and people respect him.zts15298e	Xavier needs to know what's going on with the Desert Robbers. Bring this list to him.zts15299e	Why have so many people been looking for me lately for no good reason?zts15300e	This list is nothing to do with me. What am I supposed to do with a list? I don't have a big enough influence on the Desert Robbers. What's past is past.zts15301e	But, I suppose you deserve a reward for taking the trouble to bring me this list. Here, this is for you.zts15302e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Leader of the Desert Robberszts15303e	We have to reform the Desert Robbers. To do that we'll need to convince our old leader to come back. We need his help to bring the Desert Robbers back on the right track.zts15304e	It's going to be difficult to track him down with the knowledge we currently have. We should search through every one of the Desert Robbers' camps and gather information. I'm sure Ibrahim will be looking for our former leader too, which we can make use of. Go now and defeat the commanders in each camp.zts15305e	How did fighting the commanders go? Did you get any information that will help us?zts15306e	So, it seems our former leader is located in the Chaos Zone... This information brings us a step forward.zts15307e	But I still feel like we're missing some important things. I find it unlikely that these are all of the commanders' orders.zts15308e	Which must mean that Commanders Shoran and Shay in the Desert Robber Camp have more of the information we're looking for. Defeat them and take the missing orders.zts15309e	What were you able to get from Commanders Shoran and Shay?zts15310e	There's something about the Chaos Zone in these orders. Let me have a closer look at this.zts15311e	They're planning to attack where the former leader is staying. We must protect him at all costs. The orders also indicate that they want to manipulate the local monsters and use them in the attack.zts15312e	If they find our leader in the Chaos Zone, he'd be in a lot of danger. We need to warn him, quickly. Rushaldin mentioned recently that a close friend of his lives there.zts15313e	Take this information to Rushaldin. Our former leader needs to be informed.zts15314e	What leads you to Rushaldin? Did Kamil send you?zts15315e	Honestly, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to send you to Velmon, but since you've helped Kamil, I ought to trust you in this matter.zts15316e	Fine. Please go to Velmon in the Chaos Zone and tell him what you've found out.zts15317e	He'll be able to tell you more about our former leader.zts15318e	Did Rushaldin send you to me?zts15319e	Let's be honest with one another. The former leader of the Desert Robbers is not far away.zts15320e	But he's no longer the person Kamil remembers. He's sunk into self-pity and depression. It makes me sad to see him that way, but if he'd like to see it with his own eyes, I won't stop him.zts15321e	He's sitting over there in the sand.zts15322e	Why do so many people want something from me lately?zts15323e	Listen to yourself! I can't do anything! Now leave me alone! Go away!zts15324e	Are you enjoying seeing how miserable I am?zts15325e	Take this and go already! I can't do anything else for you.zts15326e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Return of the Stolen Goodszts15327e	I've been a merchant here for decades. In all my time, I've never seen the Desert Robbers in such a position of power before. There's nothing the Akamur Merchants can do to stop them messing with the goods travelling out of the desert.zts15328e	So I'll be waiting here. Adventurers have been sent instead. They told me that if I don't want to wait any more, I should just take off. That just doesn't make sense! What was the point of making me pay all these fees?zts15329e	I can't wait much longer. The Akamur Merchants told me about the following places: Keru's and Garton's Camps, the Desert Robber Camp, and Aster Temple.zts15330e	How can you just sit there? Every moment is an eternity for me.zts15331e	Thank you very much. Now I can finally breathe again. I'll find an appropriate reward you for your efforts. You're actually getting more from me as a reward than I paid for the Akamur Merchants' fees.zts15332e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Petty Theftzts15333e	There's a rumour going round that you've been doing very well in your fights against the Desert Robbers. Maybe you could help me get my goods back?zts15334e	My goods are worth a lot and so they need to be handled with care. I've received information that they can be found in Keru's and Garton's Camps, and the Desert Robber Camp and Courtyard. Please, I have a wife and kids to feed. You need to help me!zts15335e	We have no time to rest.zts15336e	You're finally back! I thought I was bankrupt for sure. Here, this is for you. It's not very much, but I'd like you to take this.zts15337e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword and the Terror of the Chaos Zonezts15338e	I've heard that my goods have been spotted in the Chaos Zone. The Akamur Merchants claim to know where the Desert Robbers have taken my items.zts15339e	The Chaos Zone... Is it possible that the locals have made a deal with the Desert Robbers, and that's why all these thefts keep happening?zts15340e	One of the gifts found in the Chaos Zone was an alarm clock that I was going to give to my wife. You have to get it back for me. Also, please make those responsible for all this aware of my displeasure. There's someone called Velmon. But he looks so dangerous, so I've been too afraid to tell him myself.zts15341e	Of course, I'll make sure you're properly rewarded. You've got to make sure he knows.zts15342e	Do you think a resident of the Chaos Zone has stolen the items from the merchant? I think you've been misinformed.zts15343e	That is unbelievable! The people here are poor, but they are civilized, law-abiding folk. I think there must be another explanation. Wouldn't it make more sense if all this was a Desert Robber trick to try and destabilize our relations with Desert Eagle City?zts15344e	I know one of the Desert Robbers. He's known as representative Rushaldin - he's an old friend of mine. He can certainly give you more information, but to reach him you'll have to take out some of the Desert Robbers.zts15345e	Did Velmon send you?zts15346e	Velmon has always held friendship in great value. If he sent you, then I'm sure I have nothing to hide.zts15347e	Relations between the people of the Chaos Zone and the Desert Robbers? There's no such thing.zts15348e	Ibrahim doesn't trust anybody, so I don't think he'd be capable of that. But whether or not he's got a big plan in the works is another matter entirely.zts15349e	I know someone who might know more about it. There's a young thief who rebelled against Ibrahim. His name is Kamil. He's being held prisoner in the Robber Courtyard.zts15350e	Since you can't get me out of here anyway, my thoughts of leaving here have quietened. It's just the way life is sometimes. Your life's also not so different from mine.zts15351e	Interesting. If that's true, then I have something I can tell you as well.zts15352e	I know a little bit about the Chaos Zone. That's where the former leader is supposed to be hiding, right? I may be a prisoner here, but I still have my informants.zts15353e	The Desert Robbers' plan regarding the Chaos Zone is that they want to try to provoke disputes with the Desert Eagle City. Commander Shoran has a part in it, and I saw him a few days ago looking rather pleased with himself, carrying an alarm clock in his hands. He'll be somewhere around here underneath the former Aster Temple. You won't have any trouble finding him - he's always got the alarm clock on him.zts15354e	Do you think you can defeat Commander Shoran? He's a very tough opponent!zts15355e	I didn't expect a weakling such as you could defeat him.zts15356e	I'm actually surprised. I wouldn't have thought your skills were good enough.zts15357e	I've written a letter for Velmon. Bring it to him in the Chaos Zone, along with this alarm clock.zts15358e	Wasn't it my information that caused you to find this alarm clock? You've gotta give me some recognition for that, right? Well, go back to the Chaos Zone now anyway.zts15359e	How did it go? Did find any proof that will help us bring an end to this whole affair?zts15360e	Aha... So there really was a plot to cause a row between the Chaos Zone and Desert Eagle City.zts15361e	Unfortunately I can't tell you what's in Kamil's letter. I hope you understand.zts15362e	Now bring this alarm clock to Delmon Milow in Desert Eagle City.zts15363e	Tell me exactly what you found out there.zts15364e	What about my alarm clock and my goods? Do you have them?zts15365e	Thank goodness. It's really quite frightening that the Desert Robbers have made such awful plans for the Chaos Zone.zts15366e	Well, it makes me very happy that you were able to find the alarm clock. Now my wife might be a bit happier with me.zts15367e	As a reward I'm going to give you the money that I was originally going to give to the Akamur Merchants.zts15368e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword - Main Questzts15369e	It's really you! You're the adventurer [Pname] from NosCamp, aren't you?zts15370e	You're here at just the right time. Something terrible has happened.zts15371e	The Akamur Merchants have just officially asked us for our help.zts15372e	You probably don't know much about the Akamur Merchants. The Akamur Merchants are a government-run trading company, based in the Mortaz Desert south of Port Alveus. We've benefited from building a trade agreement between them and NosCamp. Unfortunately they're in a bit of a tricky situation at the moment.zts15373e	Whatever it is that's pushed them to ask for help via the official channels, it is our duty to help them. If we want to continue to have a good working relationship, we'll have to work together to overcome this.zts15374e	Please talk to the Akamur Merchants representative and offer them our help as soon as you can. You'll definitely be able to find them at the harbour. Probably best to take the official request with you.zts15375e	You must be the adventurer that NosCamp told us they'd be sending.zts15376e	It's nice to meet you. I'm the representative of the Akamur Merchants, Jin Hamadin. I take it you've been sent to stand with us during this difficult time. I see you have the request with you. So you are in fact the NosCamp representative.zts15377e	Good. Well, since this is the first time you'll be working for us, allow me to briefly explain the situation to you. After completing our previous business trip, we were on our way back to Desert Eagle City, where we're based. However, we were attacked and robbed along the way. I was sent here by Noah in order to resolve this problem. Unfortunately there's nothing the Akamur Merchants can do about this issue at the moment. That's why we sent for help.zts15378e	We've come up with a plan which we can put into motion once you arrive in the Mortaz Desert. You'll find out what you have to do next as soon as you get there. Take this letter and give it to Harbour Guard Tom.zts15379e	Are you the adventurer from NosCamp? Let me just tell you this: this place doesn't care how famous you are. Here, the only thing that counts is whether you can survive. So I wouldn't put too much stock into your name or your reputation around here. Besides, that might make it difficult for us to work together. Let's move on to the task at hand.zts15380e	Mortaz Desert Harbour has been overrun with monsters for a while now. This letter says you need to get in touch with President Noah right away. In fact, you were supposed to be taking him some wares as well, but unfortunately they were all stolen shortly before you arrived here. I'm afraid you'll have to go and find the goods first.zts15381e	They're quite valuable items. Once you've found them, bring them directly to President Noah in Akamur Camp.zts15382e	That's your first task.zts15383e	You must be the NosCamp adventurer that Jin Hamadin said he was sending.zts15384e	It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Noah, president of the Akamur Merchants. I'm also the one that had you sent here to us.zts15385e	You have no need to be nervous, though. I've already received a letter introducing you, so I'm well aware of your extensive skills. It's not necessary for you to introduce yourself to me.zts15386e	Now, let's get straight to the matter at hand. Currently, we cannot return to Desert Eagle City because of those scoundrels, the Desert Robbers. We're trying to reach an agreement with the Desert Robbers and would appreciate it if you would take over negotiations for us. Once I've finished some other tasks here, I shall write a letter for you to bring to Nephi in Desert Eagle City.zts15387e	So President Noah sent you, did he? I understand quite well what he's trying to do. We have many problems here, but the Desert Robbers take the cake. Unfortunately we don't know enough about them to know what it is they want. That's why we need your help. You have to find out what the Desert Robbers intentions are.zts15388e	If you manage to come back from this assignment in one piece, we'll have another mission for you. It's about some torn-up notes the other adventurers discovered.zts15389e	Once you're finished with this task, collect the torn up notes and bring them to High Priest Eladin at Aster Temple.zts15390e	These appear to be scraps of a traveller's diary.zts15391e	Aster Temple is currently facing a significant threat. The source of this danger can be found in the traveller's diary you found scraps of. The traveller was visiting the temple and wanted to take a closer look at things. Normally we try our hardest to give visitors to the temple what they need, but the traveller wanted to go into the Underground Caves. Shortly after entering there was a huge explosion. That's why the holy central area is currently out of bounds.zts15392e	If you could investigate the underground areas of Aster Temple for us, you would be doing us a great service. Subsequently I shall give you a letter for Nephi in Akamur Quarter.zts15393e	You're probably going to be spending a lot of your time finding out what this ominous traveller has been up to. I think all the problems plaguing the Mortaz Desert Region have something to do with this mysterious traveller.zts15394e	Aster Temple has officially requested that we conduct an investigation of this traveller. We Akamur Merchants have also collected quite a bit of information ourselves.zts15395e	We have discovered that this mysterious traveller has a central role in everything that's happening in Mortaz Desert. That's why the Akamur Merchants wanted to make an investigation into this mysterious traveller. Even the Treasure Hunter Camp got wind of this.zts15396e	Go to the Treasure Hunter Camp and begin investigating the traveller right away. Take these worker's wages with you as well. I've heard the people at the Treasure Hunter Camp are having financial troubles.zts15397e	So if Nephi is working in the Akamur Quarter now, she must have been promoted. I had no idea.zts15398e	But anyway, that's besides the point. The Akamur Merchants want information on that mysterious traveller, right?zts15399e	He visited us as well. He said something about investigating the temples. To be honest this traveller caused a lot of damage.zts15400e	We did manage to find Rashid Temple using his help, but several of our explorers went missing in the process...zts15401e	But since the Akamur Merchants have paid our wages, it's only fair that we help them out too. This letter says we're willing to help out with the investigations. Bring it to Michol at Rashid Temple. He'll assist you with your investigation.zts15402e	It's a special letter from Riana which says she's going to give us her help.zts15403e	Good. We haven't had much success with our investigations so far. Perhaps it's best if we solve our problems step by step.zts15404e	I'm Michol. I'm in better condition than all the other treasure hunters, so they put me in charge. Most of us were wounded during the traveller's exploration of the temple, so we've had to take a break from investigating for now.zts15405e	The situation is unbearable. However, I think it might be to your advantage to take over our investigations.zts15406e	You take over our investigations, and if you find anything useful, report it to Riana at the Treasure Hunter Camp. I'm sure you'll find something that will get us another step closer to understanding what the traveller was looking for. It's just a hunch, but I really do think we're going to find something.zts15407e	We collected a lot of information while you were away that we think will be useful to you. I think we've come up with some useful stuff. Apparently, the adventurers who were investigating the Desert Robbers in the area found out that the traveller and the Desert Robbers wanted to attack the Akamur Merchants. But if you'd like to investigate for yourself, there's a whole bunch more useful information to be collected.zts15408e	According to this, the former leader of the Desert Robbers was banished from the group after the traveller came into the picture. A person called Xavier is supposedly this former leader. He's apparently staying in the Chaos Zone. Go and help him with things and see if you can find out the truth. You know the deal... You scratch my back...zts15409e	This is nothing to do with me any more. I might have been a Desert Robber at one time, but that's all in the past. This means nothing to me anymore.zts15410e	You're looking for information on the mysterious traveller? He asked me to do something. It was to steal something that the Akamur Merchants were transporting. He wanted it so badly. I could see his eyes, but his face was covered by his cloak. There was such a look of menace in his eyes.zts15411e	I refused his request and was banished from the Desert Robbers soon after. That's all I know about the traveller.zts15412e	If you want to know more about the Desert Robber Camp, you'll need to go deep inside Aster Temple. Look for Kamil. I'm not their leader anymore, but he'll talk to you if you give him this seal.zts15413e	I'd like you to leave now if that's all.zts15414e	It's all the traveller's fault. Curse him! The strength of our group has shattered because of him.zts15415e	We have to find a new solution. During their investigations of the traveller, the adventurers were able to find out a few things. If you want this info, help get our band of Desert Robbers back to its former glory. We used to be so honourable.zts15416e	Some sort of drug has caused many Desert Robbers to become wildly aggressive. If you help us with this problem, I'll give you the information you want. I'll also make sure that Velmon in the Chaos Zone provides you with any additional information you want. So go to him once you're finished here.zts15417e	Kamil seems to be planning something really big. But I think it would be better for us if the Desert Robbers leave the Chaos Zone in peace.zts15418e	You've already gotten the information you want from Kamil. He really revealed a lot to you, didn't he? He thinks he's found the traveller's diary. This traveller was looking for a particular treasure, and then somehow got his hands on all the treasures in the area. Now he's interested in the Burning Sword, but the diary doesn't say why.zts15419e	I'm going to introduce you to Inspector Serge, who is the one researching the Burning Sword, to help you in your investigations. Would that be of use to you?zts15420e	Act 5 - The Burning Sword - Talking to NPCszts15421e	I'm Jin Hamadin, a representative of the Akamur Merchants. Things are difficult for the Akamur Merchants at the moment, because the Mortaz Desert is where we do most of our business.zts15422e	Could you go to Mortaz Desert and sort things out for us?zts15423e	Guarding a lighthouse isn't really all that difficult. You just have to have a lot of energy and be able to stay alert. Guard duty is a round-the-clock job!zts15424e	Where have all those silly explorers gone?zts15425e	Have you seen those idiots anywhere by any chance?zts15426e	Welcome to the Akamur Camp! All brave adventurers are welcome here. Why don't you rest in our camp a while. Is there anything you need?zts15427e	Have you had any trouble with the Desert Robbers lately?zts15428e	Are you one of those who can help us? Or rather someone we could do without?zts15429e	Come on, tell me!zts15430e	Can you see the Burning Sword in the distance? That's the name of the Volcano that you see in the north. I've come here to the Akamur Camp to investigate it.zts15431e	We haven't managed to find much out so far.zts15432e	May the Sun God's blessing be upon you. Just tell me what's the matter. Maybe I can solve your problem...zts15433e	I'm a priest of the Aster Temple, and assistant to High Priest Eladin.zts15434e	Is there anything else I can help you with?zts15435e	This isn't how I imagined life as a treasure hunter... Mountains of paperwork, everywhere you look! And I'm supposed to work through all of these documents today. Dreadful, isn't it?zts15436e	I came here to work outdoors, not to wade through mounds of documents.zts15437e	The more I talk about it, the less I want to do it. But since I'm the leader around here, there's not much I can do about it.zts15438e	Riana is still struggling with those documents. She doesn't even realise that I've already consolidated them, so she's actually dealing with far fewer than there would have been. I'm the one who's really got it hard. I regret ever having left the Akamur Merchants...zts15439e	I came here with Riana to take care of her, to make sure she didn't do anything stupid.zts15440e	My name is Nephi and I'm in charge of the Akamur Quarter. I have a brother as well as a sister. My brother has gone on a trade journey and is not back yet. Meanwhile my sister has left this place, leaving me behind as the only one to protect this place. I have to stay here and wait for my brother to return... that's my duty.zts15441e	I'm Representative Semia of the Akamur Quarter. President Noah asked me to come here and assist Nephi. I take care of most of the paperwork here, but Nephi is ultimately in charge around here. You shouldn't forget that.zts15442e	What do you need? Business isn't great at the moment, probably because of the Desert Robbers. The Akamur Merchants should be back from their trade journey soon, but a lot of orders have come in already.zts15443e	The Desert Robbers have really been on their game lately... I find it rather intimidating... I think they must have a plan for the Chaos Zone. One time I gave one of the young rascals a piece of my mind because he was being very rude. But then he tried to start a fight with me. I don't like having these violent people in the Chaos Zone.zts15444e	How can I help you?zts15445e	It's the patrol sent out to keep the Chaos Zone safe. They do their best to protect those from Desert Eagle City.zts15446e	This is the end of the Desert Robbers. The leader Ibrahim has gone mad, and we have to bring back our former leader. But I'm not strong enough to do it myself. Please help me!zts15447e	The Temple Site and the interior of the Forgotten Temple are swarming with terrifying creatures!zts15448e	This traveller has got us into this mess. He led us to this dangerous place. But now we're in these dire straits, we need your help!zts15449e	The Chaos Zone is a good place. No one cares what I do here. No one bothers me.zts15450e	Even if I decide to just get drunk all day, the people here bring me food regardless!zts15451e	It's a lot different than before, when villains made the whole area around here unsafe. I'm very happy with my life here.zts15452e	The situation in the Chaos Zone isn't great at the moment.zts15453e	A lot of people are wondering lately whether the Desert Robbers have joined forces with the Desert Eagle City and are working out a plan to attack us. Even the Burning Sword there is in danger.zts15454e	That's how the situation in the Chaos Zone looks right now.zts15455e	I would like the Chaos Zone to become an independently administered region. In Desert Eagle City there are guards backed by the Akamur Merchants, but they are not responsible for restoring the safety of this place.zts15456e	So the young people here have decided to form a security force of their own. It's difficult, but their hard work is bearing fruit.zts15457e	Even trade has become a bit of an adventure. But at least the adventure keeps us in good spirits. Life has never been easy for me anyway.zts15458e	So why shouldn't I continue the adventure? I know how to earn some real money - would you like to join me?zts15459e	I've been sent here to conduct an investigation. I want to find out how far the effects of the Burning Sword on the Chaos Zone go.zts15460e	Hopefully I'll be able to find a solution to all the problems we'll soon be having. Of course we can't solve all the problems at once, but maybe we can prevent the worst of them.zts15461e	People think they're safe, but that's just wishful thinking.zts15462e	So do you want to help me with the investigation?zts15463e	The Desert Robbers have got their fingers in all kinds of pies.zts15464e	Since we've had to survive in this harsh wasteland, we've had to become quite tough. But the most difficult thing of all was the banishment of our former leader.zts15465e	That was one of the moments in my life that I regret the most. I wish I could turn back time, but what's done is done.zts15466e	Please give me a little time. I'm an Akamur Merchant. If you give me enough time to explain what an important person I am, then you're bound to rescue me.zts15467e	Please don't leave me here alone. I can't stay here with these monsters any longer.zts15468e	Now that idiot Shane has left me in a right pickle. It's a stupid situation. If he doesn't come to his post, I'll have to deal with all his work at the harbour.zts15469e	As you can imagine, the work here isn't exactly easy. You'd better find him for me before I end up working myself to death.zts15470e	What exactly again were we just talking about?zts15471e	The merchants in the Akamur Quarter are not very nice people. I just can't get along with them. I can't believe that there's a better merchant here than me. That just can't be.zts15472e	You have to save me! Please!zts15473e	I don't like adventurers like you. You're like vermin. All you do is keep us from doing our work.zts15474e	Our new leader Ibrahim thinks that everything will soon change for the better. But the others aren't going to be able to satisfy him.zts15475e	Would you like to know something about the mission he gave me? All the camps operate independently of one another. You could say that I'm acting as Ibrahim's eyes on the ground, and I've come to observe the camps.zts15476e	While you're here talking to me, there are probably already countless elite units on their way to help me.zts15477e	One, two, three... Just how long has it been since I arrived here? I don't know any more.zts15478e	But who are you exactly? And why are you talking to me?zts15479e	It's so cold! Don't you have anything to warm me up? I can't stand the cold.zts15480e	Could you perhaps look the other way for a moment?zts15481e	Those greedy Desert Robbers have been setting up their camps, threatening us Akamur Merchants, as well as the Desert Eagle City itself.zts15482e	They've been possessed by evil forces, that's why we must destroy them. It doesn't matter what they want. Even if it's not in the best interests of the Akamur Merchants, they are still beasts who must be wiped out.zts15483e	Will you stand by me?zts15484e	I just want to be a mage! It suits me, doesn't it?zts15485e	Harbour Guard Tom (Quest)zts15486e	Level 72 - Attack on the Harbourzts15487e	Level 72 - Defending the Harbour 6zts15488e	Level 73 - A Dumb but Important Assistantzts15489e	Level 73 - Lost Trade Goods: Part 1zts15490e	Level 74 - Lost Trade Goods: Part 2zts15491e	Level 75 - Lost Trade Goods: Part 3zts15492e	Hamid (Quest)zts15493e	Level 72 - Strange Happeningszts15494e	Level 72 - Defending the Harbourzts15495e	Level 74 - Stolen Trade Goods: Part 2zts15496e	Level 75 - Stolen Trade Goods: Part 3zts15497e	Now that idiot Shane is causing problems for me.

Why is that?zts15654e	If you can't use the Wing of Return, how can you get back to the village?zts15655e	Where does the Wing of Return (Desert) take you?zts15656e	Since the Mortaz Desert is currently under the influence of the Burning Sword, you won't be able to use some of the magic items that you were otherwise able to use in NosVille.zts15657e	Up to now it hasn't been possible to use the Wing of Return, and a few other magic items also don't work quite right sometimes. It's an unfortunate situation.zts15658e	In order to solve this problem, the priests of the Aster Temple have blessed the Wing of Return (Desert).zts15659e	You can use the Wing of Return (Desert) in the desert.zts15660e	The Wing of Return (Desert) will take you back to Mortaz Desert Harbour when used. However, if you prefer, you can also set one of the teleportation towers in the Akamur Camp or Desert Eagle City as your point of return.zts15661e	I'm only telling you this because I think you might find it useful. But if you take the ship back to Port Alveus, you won't be able to use the Wing of Return (Desert) any more.zts15662e	Can you use the Amulet of Return in the Mortaz Desert?zts15663e	When I used the Amulet of Return, it didn't seem to have any effect.zts15664e	That can't be! Unlike the Wing of Return, you can use the Amulet of Return just the same as before.zts15665e	You cannot return to NosVille from the Mortaz Desert.zts15666e	Remember that you cannot share a point of return with someone else if you are at different locations.zts15667e	Teleportation Tower (Act 5 - Harbour)zts15668e	Akamur Camp (5,000 Gold)zts15669e	Desert Eagle City (10,000 Gold)zts15670e	Teleportation Tower (Act 5 - Akamur Camp)zts15671e	Mortaz Desert Harbour (0 Gold)zts15672e	Teleportation Tower (Act 5 - Desert Eagle City)zts15673e	Act 5 - Merchantzts15674e	Act 5 - Tinkererzts15675e	Out there in the desert, aggressive creatures have been attacking our cacti and destroying our crops.zts15676e	They've already wiped out a great deal of our prickly pears, and there aren't many left. We can't take this sitting down! Please go to the Port Surroundings and deal with the monsters devouring our crops.zts15677e	What is that? A prickly pear with teeth marks? So the foxes are responsible for destroying our crops.zts15678e	The prickly pears are a Mortaz Desert Harbour speciality. Recently, a bag full of prickly pears was stolen, but it's allegedly still here in the harbour somewhere. Eliminate some more creatures and find out more information about it.zts15679e	I'm sure it was them! Everything is the Desert Robbers' fault! Go north to Neil's Camp Area. You'll find Neil's patrol there. Take them out and search for the bag of prickly pears. That is proof of their guilt!zts15680e	The Akamur Merchant Patrol has no choice but to attempt to defend the harbour. Unfortunately we don't have enough guards. It's a bad situation for the harbour residents. I need to ask you for a little help. Please eliminate the Desert Robbers!zts15681e	If you go north from the Port Surroundings, you'll find a place called Neil's Camp. Take this letter and give it to Hamid, who's hiding along the way to the camp. He'll give you further instructions.zts15682e	Did Harbour Guard Tom send you? Please show me the letter you've brought.zts15683e	Well done! Unfortunately not all of the Desert Robbers threatening Mortaz Desert Harbour have been removed. I'm reminded of what Harbour Guard Tom told me a short time ago.zts15684e	When a predator hunts its prey, it doesn't simply rely on luck, it makes a plan. What I mean by that is that the Desert Robbers clearly have a plan which they're following.zts15685e	I've got good news! While you were out hunting down Neil's Elite Bombers, I received word about Commander Neil. Some days ago he seems to have received orders to attack the harbour and leave it in ruins. Go to Neil's Camp immediately, steal the order to attack and then deliver it to Harbour Guard Tom.zts15686e	(Harbour Guard Tom reads the written orders and grins.)zts15687e	Hamid needs your help in Neil's Camp Area. He is Harbour Guard Tom's assistant and was ordered to support any adventurers sent there and provide them with important information. Go to him, he'll tell you the rest.zts15688e	The Akamur Camp is the halfway point between the harbour and Desert Eagle City.zts15689e	The place must be protected from the creatures at all costs. Bring the report to Noah, who's staying at Akamur Camp. He'll be very grateful! Leave the harbour and head west to reach the camp.zts15690e	The Desert Robbers will never know what hit them! Wait, I have a job for you.zts15691e	Since Neil's Desert Robbers have lost their senses, it's time we stole the command list. We'll replace it with a forgery and create complete chaos.zts15692e	We have to find the key! Maybe Neil's Jailer has the right key to fit the lock and get it open.zts15693e	He's somewhere very close by. Take him out and get his key. Hurry!zts15694e	I'd like you to first search the Port Surroundings for the trade goods.zts15695e	This time we're dealing with the damaged trade goods. You'll have to go to Neil's Camp Area to find them. In the chaos of the attack, the Desert Robbers weren't able to keep an eye on them. Please find them and bring them to Hamid.zts15696e	We still haven't found many of the goods, and our customers are waiting for their orders. Take this reward as a token of our thanks.zts15697e	As Noah already mentioned, we're stuck in a bit of a crisis, and there's no remedy in sight.zts15698e	Reliable sources report that goods have been disappearing from the East and West Merchant Camps. Please get them back!zts15699e	There's something strange going on in Keru's Camp Area, south of the West Merchant Camp. We believe they have the trade goods that were stolen from the Akamur Merchants. Eliminate the Desert Robbers and get the goods back.zts15700e	They're taking the Akamur Merchants' trade goods to a secret location in Keru's Camp Area. Get our merchants' goods back!zts15701e	Defeat the Storm Sand Predators in Melki's Camp Area and in the East Merchant Camp. With your help we'll soon be able to continue our trade journeys.zts15702e	Did the Desert Robbers really think we'd do nothing about this? There's much we have to think about.zts15703e	The goal of this plan is to render Melki's Camp harmless. Even though our forces are not especially large, we'll have a chance at success if we can cut off the connections between Melki's Camp and remaining enemy forces.zts15704e	Take a look at your map. The quickest way to get from the Akamur Camp to Melki's Camp is the trade route that leads through the eastern merchant camp. However, the merchant camp is currently under siege by creatures. If we want to carry out our planned attack on Melki's Camp, this route is going to have to be secured. Eliminate the monsters blocking our path!zts15705e	Our goal is to attack Keru's Camp and eliminate the threat it poses. First, take care of the Desert Robbers roving about the camp and then defeat Commander Keru.zts15706e	If you have trouble handling this job on your own, take a few allies with you from Keru's Camp.zts15707e	The Desert Robbers have been launching more and more attacks lately. This is becoming a big problem. I'm very worried about this, but as the leader of the Akamur Merchants I have to show courage and strength.zts15708e	In the name of the Akamur Merchants, I have to ask you for a favour. Go to my assistant Semia and she'll give you further details.zts15709e	Garton's Camp is responsible for the blockade of Desert Eagle City. For the safety of the city, this camp must be annihilated. I need information from the patrol so that we can plan an attack.zts15710e	That is very interesting information!zts15711e	This is really great news! We've found someone who keeps up good relations with the Desert Robbers. His name is Velmon. It's not important what he may have done in the past. We only need him so that we can enter into negotiations with the Desert Robbers. I've already made all the preparations. Bring this to Velmon in the Chaos Zone.zts15712e	I've written down what you should say to him. You'll find him in the Desert Robber Camp, to the north of the Akamur Camp.zts15713e	Do you have a message from my friend Velmon? Wait a moment, let me read it, and then we can talk.zts15714e	Sadly, the problems with the Desert Robbers can't be fixed so easily. It's going to take quite a while. They're going to continue their attacks on the Akamur Merchants. If you want to continue to meet without being discovered, I suggest you eliminate Shay's and Shoran's Robbers.zts15715e	Take this letter to the person who sent you here. I'm afraid that some of the problems with the Desert Robbers are unavoidable.zts15716e	That's a shame. I had already suspected that the chances of success were pretty slim. This letter tells me of your abilities. We can use them to find a solution by other means.zts15717e	Noah set out on a trade journey half a year ago and still hasn't returned home. It's the Desert Robber's fault! In his letter it says that the Akamur Merchants will have to defend themselves against the Desert Robbers. I share this view, and in the last few days I've developed a few strategies.zts15718e	First, bring this letter to Velmon in the Chaos Zone.zts15719e	Is that another letter from the Akamur Merchants? They've been sending lots of adventurers here lately.zts15720e	Each Desert Robber commander possesses an outline of his own camp. Of course, they're not just lying about waiting to be found, but they're somewhere inside the camps. This information should be enough for you to find those outlines, shouldn't it?zts15721e	We must now eliminate the leader of the escort troops. Commanders Shoran and Shay can be found at the Robber Centre, deep inside Aster Temple. Be careful!zts15722e	Well done! Now I'm going to prepare our next operation.zts15723e	Our first target in the fight against the robbers is the Desert Robber Camp. First deal with the patrol in the Robber Camp Area and then eliminate the transport units inside the camp.zts15724e	You should get some help for your next task. Shoran and Shay's escort troops are stationed in the Robber Courtyard. We have to defeat them immediately! The entrance to this den of thieves is through the Desert Robber Camp.zts15725e	That was no easy task for sure. Thank you! I shall prepare the next operation right away.zts15726e	Bring the relics from Aster Temple to High Priest Eladin. He's expecting them. The Akamur Merchants would like to express their gratitude to the adventurer to whom they owe the success of this venture. Aster Temple will present you with your reward. If you head north from Desert Eagle City, you'll soon come across the temple.zts15727e	I have to return to Desert Eagle City as soon as possible to report my kidnapping to the Akamur Merchants. But first you'll have to free me from my shackles. Take out the Desert Robbers nearby and find the key. Bring it back here quickly and unlock my chains.zts15728e	We need two keys to unlock the chains. From here, I saw the key master giving one of the keys to the jailer. Please get both keys!zts15729e	Great work! Now the path is clear for my escape. We just need the keys.zts15730e	You seem to have overlooked something. But there must be some sort of hint. Are you going about this the wrong way maybe?zts15731e	Most of the temple has been freed of spirits. There's only a small part of the Aster Centre still to go. We'll need to drive the spirits from there as well before we can start investigating.zts15732e	Now we can start looking for clues and try to find out what caused this explosion.zts15733e	Now that the spirits have been given peace, we can begin with our investigations. We haven't been able to find any clues so far. Begin your search in the Aster Centre.zts15734e	Maybe you can find some clues about the explosion there.zts15735e	In memory of the priests that died in the explosion at Aster Temple, we must make sure to research very thoroughly. Then they'll finally rest in peace.zts15736e	Who are you? Have we met?zts15737e	We've collected all the pieces, but somehow it still seems incomplete. We have to get to the bottom of this...zts15738e	We're still missing the document with all the notes on the relics. Maybe one of the spirits haunting the Aster Centre has it on them.zts15739e	I'm currently very busy. What is it?zts15740e	The Treasure Hunter Camp is in a really awkward position right now.zts15741e	(Serena looks at Riana angrily.)zts15742e	Someone hasn't been paying attention to our expenses. It's hard to hire and pay people when most of the money's being spent on relics.zts15743e	I've taken over most of the treasure hunters' work myself.zts15744e	But let's get back to the topic at hand. I need your help with something.zts15745e	Some of the treasure hunters suspect that the report is in the area around Garton's Camp. Apparently the Desert Robbers have brought it there.zts15746e	To be honest, I don't know very much at all about ancient languages. I'm responsible for these excavations, and I only recognise a little bit of this script.zts15747e	One of the tablets is missing. We've searched the whole region though, haven't we? Is it possible that monsters took one of the tablets? I'm afraid the relic is worthless without the last tablet, which we need to decipher the tablets. Deal with the monsters near the temple and get the tablet so we can finish our investigations.zts15748e	The monsters had the tablet? With this we can finally complete our investigations.zts15749e	Thank you for acquiring the fractured tablet for us. I've got another request, but please have some rest first.zts15750e	A while ago, when I was exploring Rashid Temple, monsters came and I was suddenly forced to flee. I lost the bag I had with me. It's possible that the creatures in Rashid Centre have it. Go there and retrieve it for me!zts15751e	Xavier sent you with a letter for me?zts15752e	Xavier was once a very ambitious person. But since we were kicked out of the group, he hasn't been doing well at all.zts15753e	He gets drunk day after day, and now he's got no desire to do anything else. I want to change that.zts15754e	However, I still need a few ingredients for the magic to work. The first thing I need is some sand essence.zts15755e	You can get it from the monsters in the Chaos Zone. Can you help me with this?zts15756e	Unfortunately I can't tell whether it's sand essence or not. So I guess I'll just have to trust that you've brought me the right ingredient.zts15757e	Could you get me some wind essence next? You should be able to get it from monsters, just like with the sand essence.zts15758e	But you won't be able to find wind essence in the Chaos Zone.zts15759e	You should be able to find wind essence in the Lost Desert. Since I don't have much of a hand for magic, I am forced to rely on the aid of adventurers in such matters.zts15760e	Go to the Lost Desert and get me some wind essence.zts15761e	Is that the wind essence? I think that'll be enough for the magic.zts15762e	However, there is still one problem. The Desert Robbers from Garton's Camp have stolen it, along with some other goods.zts15763e	The wind and sand essence mixture is ready. I've mixed them into the rum, together with the fairy dust. I'll let you stir it.zts15764e	When you've mixed it enough, bring it to High Priest Eladin in Aster Temple. He'll complete the magic.zts15765e	Take him this container as well. It has something in it that I've been meaning to send him for a while. I must ask you not to open it, however.zts15766e	Great job! When Xavier comes to, he should feel much better.zts15767e	This reward is not from the Chaos Zone Guards, but from my own pocket. I know this is probably less than you expected, but I hope you'll understand and take it anyway.zts15768e	Oh bother! I've overlooked something. I'm so sorry! I need one final ingredient. I need some fairy dust. You can find it at Garton's Camp.zts15769e	Unfortunately I can't send my guards to Garton's Camp to get the fairy dust, so I'm asking you to do this as a favour. Please do your best for this last little step!zts15770e	You got the fairy dust? Very good, now I have all the ingredients I need.zts15771e	So Velmon sent you, did he? Have a rest and I'll think about what we should do next.zts15772e	Fortunately, none escaped.zts15773e	I'm going to give you the information on the Desert Robbers, but you're going to have to help us with our plans in return.zts15774e	Guards serving the leader Ibrahim have been stationed in Robber Courtyard. We have to defeat them!zts15775e	The Akamur Merchants are responsible for the administration and security of Desert Eagle City. Despite this, the inhabitants of the Chaos Zone are having to fend for themselves.zts15776e	Unfortunately, we don't have enough troops at the moment to guarantee safety. Please help us with this.zts15777e	We'll be able to reward you pretty handsomely, as the Akamur Merchants are our financiers.zts15778e	We've found out that it's been difficult to make peace because of the problems with the Desert Robbers. I cannot forgive them for that.zts15779e	That's why we want to work together with the Akamur Merchants - to eliminate the Desert Robbers.zts15780e	First go to Keru's Camp area, to the south-west of Akamur Camp, and wipe out the scouting party there.zts15781e	Thank you very much. Let's prepare to attack the Desert Robbers directly.zts15782e	Just like before, but this time go to Garton's Camp Area and attack the patrol there.zts15783e	Of course we tried to talk things through with them.zts15784e	While you were away, we tried to find a peaceful resolution. But they have simply rebuffed our efforts.zts15785e	Begin by attacking the Desert Robbers at Garton's Camp. Please keep in mind that Commander Garton will not be an easy opponent.zts15786e	Thank you very much! Now we can prepare for the attack on Garton's Camp.zts15787e	(Some pages have been ripped out of this diary.)zts15788e	The Desert Robbers have occupied Aster Temple. Surprisingly, they seem to have good relations with the Akamur Merchants.zts15789e	We need to find a way to destroy this friendship. We should also keep adventurers away from this place.zts15790e	(Picks up the traveller's diary and skims through it.)zts15791e	The Traveller's Diary. This is the first time I've seen this.zts15792e	The Desert Robbers use magical fairy dust to rid themselves of bad thoughts and emotions. They can use it to keep their more evil instincts under control. Most robbers will have some fairy dust on them.zts15793e	However, to gather it you will need a special bag that can be found here in the Rashid Courtyard. Go and get the bag.zts15794e	It cannot be stopped. The traveller who wrote this diary seems to be cleverer than we thought.zts15795e	This isn't the first time I found the Desert Robbers' loyalty to Leader Ibrahim strange. We have to find out why this is happening. Go to the Robber Courtyard and Robber Centre and see whether you can find out if anything dodgy is going on.zts15796e	That's the bag I told you to get.zts15797e	You will need all three types of fairy dust in order to get the desired effect. Wind Fairy Dust, Fire Fairy Dust and Sand Fairy Dust can all be found in the Desert Robber Camp. Take this bag and collect some dust. Please hurry!zts15798e	Because I was captured and brought here, I no longer know what things are like within the ranks of Desert Robbers.zts15799e	They haven't done anything to me. Apparently they think I won't be able to cause any trouble from in here.zts15800e	Don't worry, it's an easy mission. Go to the Desert Robber Camp and eliminate Shoran's troops. Then give me a report on the Desert Robbers' status.zts15801e	Good luck!zts15802e	We're going to have to be thoroughly prepared. This time, investigate Shay's forces in the Desert Robber Camp. You won't be able to avoid eliminating them.zts15803e	I'm curious to know how the Desert Robbers will react when you attack. Please continue your investigations. I wonder if they're up to something mischievous.zts15804e	Rushaldin sent this for me?zts15805e	Did Kamil send you to me?zts15806e	Now, go to Velmon in the Chaos Zone and tell him what you and Kamil found out.zts15807e	What does Rushaldin have to report?zts15808e	Kamil can probably only remember our leader as he once was. But the man he once knew is not here today. He's sunk into self-pity and depression. It makes me sad to see him that way.zts15809e	If he'd like to see it with his own eyes, I won't stop him. He's sitting over there in the sand.zts15810e	Oh, hello! What do you want to know?zts15811e	Kamil might know more about this matter. He'll be in the Robber Courtyard.zts15812e	The only reason the Desert Robbers are moving into the Chaos Zone is to try and destabilise relations with Desert Eagle City. This is the work of Commander Shoran.zts15813e	Also, a while ago I saw him holding an alarm clock - he seemed very pleased with himself. Commander Shoran is somewhere here in the Robber Centre. He has that alarm clock. Well find him.zts15814e	Dialogue Testzts15815e	Please wait a moment. I want to try and guess your profession. You're a [PCLASS: Adventurer, Swordsman, Archer, Mage]!

It would be nice if you could bring me these ingredients.zts15822e	In return, I'll read the tarot cards for you.zts15823e	Fortune-Teller Nuki's Request (Daily) - Middlezts15824e	Ah, so you have indeed brought me what I asked for. Then allow me to lay out the cards for you.zts15825e	Fortune-Teller Nuki's Request (Daily) - Endzts15826e	I will need a few ingredients before the tarot cards can be read.zts15827e	Supply Officer Jamal will probably have some, but he's not selling it for coin, he'll want to trade for something else. So go and get me some of the Robber Gang's Copper Coins.zts15828e	I need to prepare something, but I still need some hot leather.zts15829e	I would be very grateful to you if you could bring me some hot leather.zts15830e	In return, I'll read the tarot cards for you.zts15831e	I'm currently preparing an aid for fortune-telling, but I still need some ingredients before I can complete it.zts15832e	Do you think you can bring me some hot lumps of metal?zts15833e	It would be nice if you could bring me the ingredients I need.zts15834e	Since I still don't have all the ingredients, the tarot cards cannot be read for you.zts15835e	Noah wants to see the report on the liberation of the captured merchant. He'd like you to deliver it personally. Go to him right away!zts15836e	If I'm to believe the reports of the Akamur Merchants, then the Desert Robbers are responsible for the monster attacks on our trade routes.zts15837e	To be honest, I don't know very much at all about ancient languages. I'm responsible for these excavations, and I only recognise a little bit of this script.zts15838e	Exchange Certificates of Attendancezts15839e	Would you like to exchange your Certificates of Attendance for an item?zts15840e	You can get different items, depending on the number of Certificates of Attendance you have!zts15841e	Yes, I'd like to exchange them.zts15842e	No, I'd rather trade them later.zts15843e	You require a Grasslin Seal to confront the Grasslins. Bring me three lots of Rice, Chicken Drumsticks and Bamboo, plus 20,000 gold, and I'll give you a seal.zts15844e	To be honest, I don't know a thing about the ancient script.

Then they yell 'Trick or Treat!' to get bags of sweets.zts15913e	During this time of year, escaped spirits walk among the living, going from door to door and demanding bags of sweets. But since they don't play any pranks on others, Halloween goes by quite peacefully.zts15914e	During Halloween, you should only ask each person for sweets once, otherwise if you keep asking, the spirits will copy you. You should also dress up as a monster, otherwise some residents might not give you anything.zts15915e	If you collect a lot of bags and bring them to me, I'll reward you for being such a good example for the spirits.zts15916e	Okay, I understand.zts15917e	In every village, an NPC with a shop will give you something.

I am a priestess.zts16155e	I am looking into the current situation in the Region of the Burning Sword. All of this started when someone stole the fire god relics from the temples around the Mortaz Desert Harbour. This mountain is shaking.zts16197e	Hey, you've arrived just at the right time.zts16212e	We need to search for more relics. Could you go to Michol at the Temple Site and ask if he has found any more?zts16213e	Hello. Priestess Serizad has sent you here to ask me about the current state of my investigations?zts16216e	I have discovered an unstable Time-Space deep in the catacombs of the temple. It's making it very difficult to investigate this place.zts16217e	We'll need to investigate this area a bit more thoroughly before we can discuss everything with Serizad. Will you help me do this?zts16227e	Oh. This pattern looks like the one we found on the fire god's relic.zts16229e	I have analysed the relic, but I am not knowledgeable enough to come to any definite conclusions.zts16230e	Here is a copy of my research. It would be nice if you could take it to Serizad for me.zts16231e	I'll stay here and keep looking for more relics. Maybe I can find out more about them. I'd appreciate it if you could come by often and help me out a bit.zts16262e	The intermediary seal has been destroyed...zts16269e	I think that the two seals have something to do with the monstrous power that was released when the intermediary seal was destroyed. You're best off asking High Priest Eladin.zts16271e	Those are the raid seals of Kertos and Valakus.zts16274e	But now that the intermediary seal has been destroyed, they have both reawoken.zts16277e	Take these raid seals and search for some brave adventurers to help you defeat these two monsters. Be sure to tell Serizad about it too.zts16278e	(You tell Priestess Serizad what you found out.)zts16282e	I'm going to look for some people that can help us. But if you could look for some brave fighters as well, I'd be very grateful.zts16288e	Go and talk to Priestess Serizad!zts16303e	Thanks to you we have been able to avoid a terrible catastrophe. We will never forget you, brave adventurer!zts16304e	Collect even more Ice Flowers!

I lost my ship and my entire crew in one swoop. Arrghh!zts16345e	Ahoy landlubber! Get revenge on my enemy Captain Pete O'Peng and infiltrate the pirate ship! Oh... and can you bring me a bottle of lime juice? I'm gasping for a drink of the stuff, because I've got a touch of scurvy, that old sailor's disease.zts16346e	Accept request.zts16347e	Disguise as Buccaneer (only possible once)zts16348e	Exchange for Pirate Sealzts16350e	What is the Pirate SP?zts16351e	Before you infiltrate the pirate ship, you'd best disguise yourself as a buccaneer. That way you can take them scurvy sea dogs by surprise!zts16352e	Here is the Pirate SP so you can infiltrate the crew. Remember, landlubber, that you can only use it during the event.zts16353e	Aye aye, sir!zts16354e	Bring me 10 Mariner's Symbols and 10 Treasure Map Fragments for the pirate island, and I'll give you the Pirate Seal in exchange. Come on, get a move on, I don't have all day!zts16355e	You can start the Pirate Raid with the aid of the Pirate Seal.zts16356e	I'll only swap them for a Pirate Seal!zts16359e	Gamble for the Pirate SPzts16360e	You can use that to transform into a pirate!zts16361e	You might be able to loot the Pirate SP from a raid box! Or maybe not! Hahaha!zts16362e	Captain Jack Panon's Daily Requestzts16363e	Off you go now, landlubber, open the gates to hell for Captain Pete O'Peng!!!zts16364e	Hahaha! Well done, landlubber!zts16365e	Go and send Pirate Jackpen to hell!zts16366e	Go and send Pirate Kangpen to hell!zts16367e	Come on, hurry up! Scurvy is making me very thirsty. It's an old seafaring sickness, y'know. Now go already!zts16368e	You're very trustworthy! I didn't expect this from you, landlubber!zts16369e	Bring me the scarves of the pirates we're hunting. Off you go!zts16370e	Hahaha! Well done, landlubber!zts16371e	Gamble for the Pirate SPzts16372e	Do you want to try your luck? Why not gamble for the Pirate SP and give me one part of the Pirate SP and 5,000 Gold?zts16373e	If Lady Luck is smiling, you'll loot a Pirate SP or another item. Are you brave enough to try it?zts16374e	Do you want to try your luck?

Unfortunately we don't have these ingredients at the moment. Do you have any?zts16391e	Yeah, I have the ingredients. Please produce it.zts16392e	End Dialoguezts16393e	Production is difficult as the trade route is blocked. There just aren't enough ingredients.zts16394e	The Desert Robber has taken the rest of the ingredients for himself and is selling them at higher prices.zts16395e	Valoren the Desert Robberzts16396e	Hmm? You want to know if I have any Salt? But of course! I can't sell it to you cheaply though, it's a very rare commodity.zts16397e	If you're not interested in buying any, you should fetch your own.zts16398e	Transaction: Salt for 50,000 Goldzts16399e	I am not interested in buying it for that kind of price.zts16400e	In the Time-Space I was unable to find any significant clues, but the sand that the monster lost could be one. Or is this simply another trick from that mysterious guy in the coat?zts16401e	I sense some magical energy emanating from this glittering sand.zts16402e	(Suddenly a strong wind blows the sand from your hand. It creatures a strange pattern on the floor.)zts16403e	Wow, the ground itself is glowing! Does the glittering sand have something to do with this phenomenon?zts16404e	I think I'll be able to find out more if I can get hold of more of this sand and spread it around. I'm pretty sure I saw more of this glowing sand on the way into the catacombs. I'll take another look there.zts16405e	I think these might be the remains of defeated monsters. I'd better take them to Michol.zts16406e	I thought that you had given up, seeing as you were gone for so long. Now you've brought important clues with you. Thank you. With them you are helping me greatly with my work.zts16407e	(You tell Serizad of your encounter with the Mysterious Traveller.)zts16408e	You saw him? Could that be an omen for future events?zts16409e	*Boooooooom!*zts16410e	... I feel a strange vibration.zts16411e	I think that the strange vibration just now came from the underground of the Burning Sword. It could be that there is a problem with the intermediary seal. For your safety, I'll cast a protective spell on you.zts16412e	The spirit of Katol burns in the eternal flames... Bless this person!zts16413e	(A red aura surrounds you.)zts16414e	Oh, that feels somewhat peculiar...zts16415e	Right, hopefully the Seal Protector won't attack you now. Hopefully...zts16416e	He seems to have disappeared again. I can't see him.zts16417e	We're going to need more adventurers to defeat Kertos and Valakus. I'll look for help myself, but it'd be great if you could round up a party yourself.zts16418e	It's important that you defeat all the monsters, however I've heard from the adventurer John that the entrance to the Time-Space has opened. It is located deep within the Burning Sword region and is perhaps also the location where the final seal can be found.zts16419e	I suspect that this Time-Space entrance was so well hidden as a final protection for the interior seal. Perhaps this wouldn't have opened if the other two seals hadn't been destroyed.zts16420e	I have asked for some help, but by the time the soldiers arrive it will be too late. Now that the Time-Space entrance is visible, the mysterious traveller can destroy this last seal as well. Please get to the Time-Space as soon as possible!zts16421e	The seal remains intact.zts16422e	You were able to successfully protect the seal. We are infinitely grateful to you.zts16423e	(You show Priestess Serizad the items.)zts16424e	The mysterious traveller lost this? This is the first time that I've seen this. However I can feel a certain type of energy... it might be something to do with the traveller's origins! But I don't know any more than that.zts16425e	Fire god Grenigas couldn't be fully resurrected, because the inner seal remained intact. He is still very weak. At the moment it would be easy for us to gather our power and beat him down.zts16426e	To get to Grenigas, you need Kertos and Valakus' raid seals. If you bring me these seals, I will produce a seal for you so you can enter the Grenigas raid.zts16427e	Tell Hazel about it.zts16428e	Time-Space 1 - Rashid Temple Catacombszts16429e	Aaaaaaaaaaarghhhhh!zts16430e	Arg! You! You dare scare me! I'll get you back for that!zts16431e	Bah! Michol is right, there are monsters showing up everywhere. This investigation won't be easy.zts16432e	(It seems very suspicious to me that all these monsters are already dead.)zts16433e	There are just more and more dead monsters...zts16434e	Pff, I don't like it. As if I were the plonker here! Let's get started!zts16435e	He easily defeated these monsters, and then ran off! Apparently he was in a rush as he didn't cut all of them down. Who is this guy?zts16436e	...zts16437e	Huh? Who's there? Did you defeat all the monsters?zts16438e	Hey, I'm talking to you! The guy in the black coat is running away! I've got a bad feeling about this. I'll follow him...zts16439e	Argh! I can't see him. Just how fast is this guy?! I'll get him eventually.zts16440e	..zts16441e	I've finally found you! Who are you?zts16442e	How annoying. I'm not going to waste my time on someone like you!zts16443e	(The Mysterious Traveller says something unintelligible, and then monsters suddenly appear everywhere. Then he simply disappears.)zts16444e	Oi, you there! Wait a second! He summoned the monsters and then disappeared into thin air.zts16445e	This guy can summon monsters?! Maybe he has something to do with recent events. I'd best hurry up before he manages to get away.zts16446e	I have found him, that suspicious guy in the coat. He's not getting away from me this time...zts16447e	You survived that wave of monsters? You're better than I thought.zts16448e	You aren't from a Desert Robber Camp and you're not one of the Akamur Merchants... Who are you?!zts16449e	I don't have the slightest interest in revealing my identity to you. Just die!zts16450e	Pardon me? You rude man! I won't let you get away.zts16451e	You're annoying!zts16452e	We aren't finished with one another. Wait!zts16453e	Sorry, little adventurer, but I don't have time today. I can't waste my time on a loser like you. But I've left you a little surprise at the exit. Bye bye!zts16454e	(The Mysterious Traveller disappears in a cloud of dust.)zts16455e	Drat! He got away again...zts16456e	Damn it!zts16457e	Huh? Spirits? That's the big surprise? He's giving me the run-around here. Alright fine, now it's getting serious!zts16458e	Bah! I finally managed to defeat these creatures. That coat guy dropped something. Best take it with me.zts16459e	Time-Space 2 - Intermediary seal of the Burning Swordzts16460e	Could that be the protector that Serizad spoke of? Hopefully Serizad's magic will protect me and it won't attack me. Hehe, I feel pretty safe. Bring it on, monsters!zts16461e	The protector is actually leaving me alone. Serizad's protective magic seems to be working.zts16462e	This place is defended by the protectors of the seal. This place is teeming with them!zts16463e	Oops! This protector is different to the others. It seems to be guarding the intermediary seal.zts16464e	Kkkkkkrrrrhh!zts16465e	I don't fully understand the situation, but once started, a fight must be ended. Charge!zts16466e	I feel strange. Perhaps the effects of Serizad's magic is fading? Strange. I'll keep going.zts16467e	The seal protectors are fighting the monsters. They have been a great help, but I should be a little more careful this time.zts16468e	This protector was normal again. Which hopefully means the protective magic is still working... I wonder what was wrong with the other protecters? Could it be another trick of the mysterious guy in the robe?zts16469e	Ach, you again?! I knew it! What did you do to the seal protector?zts16470e	Hehe, I don't see a reason to explain the details to you. I just needed to keep the seal protector out of my way!zts16471e	Did you summon him? Hmph, look at you. I have not yet forgotten our last encounter. Let's fight, here and now!zts16472e	While I'd love the opportunity to keep you company, I'm afraid I just don't have the time. So long.zts16473e	(The Mysterious Traveller destroys the lever and disappears.)zts16474e	Grr, that guy is good at running off. I'm not going to give up though, I'll show him!zts16475e	The lever is broken and I cannot follow him further. I'll look for another way.zts16476e	Maybe the exit will open if I use the lever in the corner over there? It might be a trap, though.zts16477e	Drat! So it was a trap. This guy is constantly leaving me in difficult situations. I'll have to return the favour. Looks like I opened the exit somehow anyway, so I guess I'll head on in.zts16478e	Urgh, all of these monsters were summoned! Just you wait! I will find you!zts16479e	Freeze! I'm not letting you get away again!zts16480e	Your persistence is impressive. After all, not many would manage to follow me to the secret location of the intermediary seal.zts16481e	Excuse me? The intermediary seal location? Are you saying you're here to destroy the valuable seal?zts16482e	What the? Didn't you know that? Have you been toddling along behind me this entire time? Aren't you the genius...zts16483e	Very well, at least now I have a good reason for taking you out. I won't let you destroy the intermediary seal!zts16484e	We'll see if you are right. For a start, you can try and survive this wave of monsters I'm about to summon! Muahaha!zts16485e	(The Mysterious Traveller has summoned monsters and then disappeared.)zts16486e	Hey stop, you coward! You summon these dumb monsters and then just clear off? It's so stupid! I've no time for it!zts16487e	(As you finally defeat all the monsters, you hear a gigantic explosion.)zts16488e	Oh no! The intermediary seal! Quick!zts16489e	The intermediary seal... is destroyed.zts16490e	Ooooooh... I think I'm going to cry.zts16491e	I couldn't protect the intermediary seal from you. I'll never forgive you for that. Attack me!zts16492e	How ridiculous. You really think you can fight me? I could destroy you here and now, but I'm going to give you one more chance.zts16493e	Give me a chance?! Pff.zts16494e	Yes. I'm going to destroy the final seal. Just try and stop me, if you can... hahaha! I look forward to it!zts16495e	(The Mysterious Traveller disappears in a cloud of dust.)zts16496e	Argh, talk about humiliation! I won't forget that! I will protect the last seal with everything I have.zts16497e	Time-Space 3 - Interior Seal of the Burning Swordzts16498e	This is where the last seal is. That guy in the robe will be turning up here soon.  I need to be the one to find the seal first.zts16499e	If I can distract the protector, then I should be able to get through with no problems.zts16500e	That is a summoned seal protector! That means that guy has already been here. He's going to cause trouble! I need to hurry.zts16501e	I guess he worked out that I would follow him and summoned monsters in his wake. There's no time. Bring it!zts16502e	This place is like a labyrinth. I'll need to concentrate or I might get lost. I've just got to be faster than the mysterious traveller.zts16503e	Phew, finally! I've found the seal. It's not damaged.zts16504e	(Suddenly the Mysterious Traveller appears at the other side of the corridor.)zts16505e	Wow! You managed to get here quicker than me! I shall treasure that! You rookie!zts16506e	What are you on about? I'm not interested whether you respect me or not. Besides, I'm no rookie!zts16507e	Hahaha! You say that you are no rookie! And yet you seem to've already forgotten the mistake you made last time.zts16508e	No, of course not. Your words just make me want to protect the seal at all costs! Even with my life!zts16509e	Hehe, I'm starting to like you a little. But before I can complete my task, I'll have to destroy you, I'm afraid. Of course, if you would be so gracious as to give me the seal, I'll let you walk away. You fool!zts16510e	No, of course not. Your words just make me want to protect the seal at all costs! Even with my life!zts16511e	Argh. How is a rookie able to bring me to my knees?! I've become too kind.zts16512e	That's enough. Don't act like you gave me a second chance. I have risked my life.zts16513e	Haha! Yes, you fought well.zts16514e	I have one more question for you.zts16515e	Finish it, you idiot. *cough* You should hurry, I don't have much time left.zts16516e	Who are you and why are you trying to destroy the last seal?zts16517e	Hehehe. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to answer these questions. You'll find out who I am soon enough! *cough*zts16518e	Hey! Pull yourself together, don't die!zts16519e	Farewell...zts16520e	(A bright light radiates from the Mysterious Traveller's body. The light circles him and then slowly disappears.)zts16521e	Gone. I've never seen such a mysterious death. I managed to protect the seal, but I feel guilty all the same. Who was he?zts16522e	(You see a mysterious pendant lying at the final resting place of the traveller.)zts16523e	This design on the pendant is new to me. I will keep hold of it for now and investigate it more later. In any case I have protected the seal. I need to speak to Serizad as soon as possible.zts16524e	Raiding Melki's Campzts16525e	I could travel across the desert much faster on the camel.zts16526e	Serizad Main Questzts16527e	Level 80 - The Burning Swordzts16528e	Level 82 - Calling All Akamur Merchantszts16529e	Level 84 - To the Temple Sitezts16530e	Level 86 - Portal to the Region of the Burning Swordzts16531e	Hazel from the Akamur Merchants is looking for someone to tend to the seal of the Burning Sword.zts16532e	When he heard about this brave adventurer, he said he would give you the Ice Flower Oil if you visited him.zts16533e	I'm really sorry.

However, you will need ice flower oil to protect yourself, because it's an extremely hot place. You can get the protective oil from John the adventurer.zts16557e	I can make some ice flower oil for you using rare ice flowers.

Time to return to John.)zts16566e	Thanks a lot! You've really made my work easier. Now I can continue investigating.zts16567e	Serizad is looking for you. Better go see her, quick.zts16568e	Have you met John the adventurer?zts16569e	In order to repair the destroyed seal I need more information, and the fire god relics.zts16570e	My investigation has been made more difficult by many of the entrances at the temple being blocked. Investigating Rashid Temple is taking a long time. There are many evil spirits there who are hindering our progress.zts16571e	(I believe that this Grenigas relic that the mysterious traveller lost is an important piece of evidence. I'll take it to Michol.)zts16572e	(You give Michol the Grenigas relic.)zts16573e	Oh. Oh, this relic looks exactly like the Grenigas relic. It's the real thing???zts16574e	You were gone a long time, I was beginning to worry that you'd given up.  But it's good that you're here again and have brought me these research documents! Thank you. They will be of great help.zts16575e	You saw him, you say? I think something terrible is going to happen... We are in desperate need of more information.zts16576e	Go and ask John the adventurer how his investigations are going.zts16577e	Gather informationzts16578e	Thanks to your help, my investigations are coming along nicely. However, I still haven't found anything useful.zts16579e	Was Priestess Serizad able to make any progress repairing the seals?zts16580e	(You explain everything that has happened to John the adventurer.)zts16581e	A new relic and a mysterious traveller, you say... what is going on here?zts16582e	I think we need to broaden our investigations and search deeper inside.zts16583e	Please help me by defeating the monsters that are disrupting my investigations.zts16584e	Further into the depthszts16585e	During the solitary investigationzts16586e	Phew. I think that's enough. The deeper I go, the stronger the monsters seem to get...zts16587e	As always, I need to hurry back to John.zts16588e	Now we can investigate some more hidden areas. Thank you.zts16589e	You've been a great help to me. Could you perhaps do me one more favour?zts16590e	I'm not the only one researching the monsters of the Region of the Burning Sword. There is a fire alchemist.zts16591e	I haven't heard from him in a while.zts16592e	Please search for the missing fire alchemist. To do this, you'll have to go further into the Burning Sword region.zts16593e	Fire Alchemistzts16594e	(His clothes imply he's the fire alchemist that John the adventurer is looking for. I'll just ask him.)zts16595e	Hello! Am I right in thinking you're the Fire Alchemist?zts16596e	Fire Alchemist? Oh is that what they call me? Yes, that's me. I didn't think I would see anyone else here... what are you doing here? Hardly anybody enters this place...zts16597e	I'm here because John the adventurer asked me to look for you.zts16598e	Aha... He sent you did he? I was so busy working on my investigations that I forgot to report back to him...zts16599e	Well, you seem to be doing just fine. I'll head back and tell him that he has no need to worry.zts16600e	Just a moment. You must be pretty brave to have made it this far! Could I ask a favour of you?zts16601e	I'd like to develop a potion to help adventurers withstand the heat of this place. I've already made a lot of progress with it. But an important area of research is blocked. One of the ingredients I need for my potion there.zts16602e	Could you procure a Valaket Egg for me?zts16603e	Valaket Eggzts16604e	You have collected enough Valaket Eggs. Return to the Fire Alchemist.zts16605e	Oh... I knew that I could rely on you. You've already done it! Thank you! Now I can continue developing my potion.zts16606e	While you were away, I went to see John. He needs to see you as soon as possible! He said he's found an intermediary seal or something... I don't really know what he's on about. But hurry!zts16607e	Is it true that you've discovered an intermediary seal?zts16608e	Yeah it is! After you took care of the monsters, I made my way down the path to have a look around Valakus' Claws. Then I found the Time-Space.zts16609e	I haven't managed to tell priestess Serizad about it yet. Could you take care of that for me?zts16610e	(You tell Serizad that John has discovered an intermediary seal.)zts16611e	So John's found it. We have to hurry before the mysterious traveller comes to destroy the intermediary seal.zts16612e	It could be that you will be attacked by the seal protectors. I'm going to cast protective magic over you.zts16613e	Right, hopefully the Seal Protector won't attack you now. Hopefully...zts16614e	(Hurry to Serizad!)zts16615e	The intermediary seal might be destroyed after all.zts16616e	Now all that's left is the last seal. We must retrieve it from the mysterious traveller, otherwise there could be disastrous consequences. Could you tell John that he should hurry up with his investigation in the Burning Sword region?zts16617e	(You tell John what's happened.)zts16618e	As Priestess Serizad said, it's important that we find the last seal before the mysterious traveller does.zts16619e	Eliminate the monsters in the Region of the Burning Sword, so that we can continue our investigations.zts16620e	Hunt monsters in the baking heat!zts16621e	(You have eliminated all the monsters. You should return to John.)zts16622e	You've defeated all the monsters. Thank you.zts16623e	I discovered some wondrous items during my investigation. I think it's something to do with the intermediary seal being destroyed, because these strange giant monsters have been appearing all over the place.zts16624e	Show Priestess Serizad these items.zts16625e	(You show the Kertos' and Valakus' raid seals.)zts16626e	Some documents I found a little while ago said that the two powerful monsters could be found further into the Burning Sword... err... specifically in Grenigas' Temple. They are sealed there, together with the terrible fire god, Grenigas.zts16627e	The more power they receive, the stronger Grenigas will get - then he will be able to destroy the seal himself. Then he'd be free... how terrible!zts16628e	If the seal is destroyed, no-one will be able to stop Grenigas. Kertos and Valakus must be defeated so that Grenigas cannot continue gathering strength.zts16629e	So that's how it is... To prevent Grenigas from regaining his powers, both of these monsters need to be destroyed.zts16630e	We're going to need more adventurers if we want to destroy Kertos and Valakus.zts16631e	Kertos has been defeated? Then that's just Valakus left. Finish him!zts16632e	(Kertos and Valakus have been defeated. You return to Serizad.)zts16633e	Valakus has also been destroyed. Very well done!zts16634e	All that remains now is for us to find the final seal before the mysterious traveller. Go to John the adventurer and tell him what has happened.zts16635e	(You explain everything that's happened to John.)zts16636e	The last seal, you say... We'll need to go further into the Region of the Burning Sword than anyone has been before. I think I need to leave immediately.zts16637e	Could you go to the Fire Alchemist and ask him how far he has gotten with his research?zts16638e	How is your research going?zts16639e	Hmm... I'm about 90% done. I still need one final ingredient however... Please gather some Flame Giant's Hearts for me.zts16640e	The flame giants are located in the most sinister part of the Burning Sword region.zts16641e	Very good! You've collected all the hearts. Return to the fire alchemist.zts16642e	(You hand over the Flame Giant's Hearts.)zts16643e	Excellent! You've collected all the hearts. Just a moment. Now the results of my work will come to light... this is the most important moment!zts16644e	(...)zts16645e	(...)zts16646e	It's finally complete...zts16647e	The potion is ready! If you take this heat resistance potion then you can survive the heat in the Burning Sword region for much longer. Please take it to John.zts16648e	(Give John the Heat Resistance Potion.)zts16649e	Oh. The investigations are over. I believe that this heat resistance potion will be a great help to us.zts16650e	Ah! I almost forgot - hurry to Serizad and tell her my news!zts16651e	Huh?! What should I report?zts16652e	I was so busy that I forgot all about something very important. I have found the final seal in the deepest part of the Burning Sword, near Katol's Street. We have no more time to lose. Please tell priestess Serizad the news. And be quick about it!zts16653e	Finally the last seal has been discovered.zts16654e	Go to the place where the last seal is hidden before the Mysterious Traveller destroys it.zts16655e	I have just found out from John the adventurer, that the entrance to the Time-Space is in the depths of the Burning Sword.zts16656e	(You show Serizad the Mysterious Pendant.)zts16657e	I have put together the fragments we collected to form a seal. This will help you get where Grenigas currently resides. Here, let me give this to you.zts16658e	Please join the other very brave adventurers so that you can eliminate Grenigas together.zts16659e	Grenigas has finally been defeated!zts16660e	But it isn't over yet. He is an immortal entity, a god of fire! He isn't truly dead.zts16661e	But it will take a long, long time for him to regain his physical form. In the mean time, we will try to rebuild the outer seal.zts16662e	Defeat Monsters in the Region of the Burning Sword (Daily)zts16663e	Eliminate all the monsters hindering research into the Burning Sword.zts16664e	Report back to John the adventurer.zts16665e	Hello? Who's there? Are you the one that defeated the monsters?zts16666e	Hey, I'm talking to you! The guy in the black coat is running away! I've got a bad feeling about this. I'll follow him...zts16667e	Hey, you there! Wait up! He summoned the monsters and then dissipated into the air.zts16668e	This guy can summon monsters?! Maybe he has something to do with recent events. I'd best hurry up before he manages to get away.zts16669e	I have found him, that suspicious guy in the coat. He's not getting away from me this time...zts16670e	You aren't from a Desert Robber Camp and you're not one of the Akamur Merchants... Who are you?!zts16671e	Drat! He got away again...zts16672e	What's this about? Are the monsters a gift or something?zts16673e	Phew! I finally managed to defeat these creatures. That coat guy dropped something. Best take it with me.zts16674e	The lever is broken and I cannot follow him further. I'll look for another way.zts16676e	Urgh, all of these monsters were summoned! Just you wait! I will find you!zts16677e	Hey, you! Freeze! I won't let you escape this time!zts16678e	What the? Didn't you know that? Have you been toddling along behind me this entire time? Aren't you the genius...zts16679e	I couldn't protect the intermediary seal from you. I'll never forgive you for that. Attack me!zts16680e	What are you on about? I don't care whether you respect me or not. Besides, I'm no rookie!zts16681e	Hahaha! You say that you are no rookie! And yet you seem to've already forgotten the mistake you made last time.zts16682e	Haha! Yes, you fought well.zts16683e	I have one more question for you.zts16684e	Who are you and why are you trying to destroy the last seal?zts16685e	Hehehe. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to answer these questions. You'll find out who I am soon enough! *cough*zts16686e	Hey! Pull yourself together, don't die!zts16687e	(A bright light radiates from the Mysterious Traveller's body. The light circles him and then slowly disappears.)zts16688e	Hello. I am one of the military engineers building the camp on behalf of Priestess Serizad. I would be very grateful to you if you would collect some construction materials.zts16689e	Ask Serizad about the seals.zts16690e	Fire god Grenigas has been defeated. Report back to priestess Serizad.zts16692e	10x Ice Flower Oil (5 Akamur Coupons)zts16693e	Level 85: Burning Swordzts16694e	I made loads of hats especially for Halloween, but they don't look that great.zts16695e	I don't think I can carry on like this. I need some new inspiration. Bring me something to help inspire me. As a reward I'll give you a Bag of Sweets and a Pumpkin Hat (1 Day).zts16696e	Okay, I'll bring something to inspire you.zts16697e	It is Hal... Hal... Halloween, but Mi... Mi... Mimi's face looks so gloomy! I don't know what's wrong with her. But I can't j... j... just ignore it. Please cheer her up!zts16698e	The Pumpkin Hat (1 Day) seems to be very p-p-popular because lots of p-p-people are wearing it. Talk to Mimi to get a pu-pu-pumpkin hat. I'll also give you a Bag of Sweets and a Tarot Card for it.zts16699e	Sure, I'll put a smile on her face!zts16700e	That's a real pain! Halloween is just around the corner and I haven't even cooked the new pumpkin meals yet!zts16701e	Rumour has it that you can make Pumpkin Syrup in Jack O'Lantern's raid. Could you bring me some for the meal? I'll give you a Bag of Sweets and 50 Yellow Pumpkin Sweets as a reward.zts16702e	Ericzts16703e	Trick or Treat Questzts16704e	Exchange Sweetszts16705e	Exchange Bags of Sweetszts16706e	Oh dear... we've got a big problem!zts16707e	Jack O'Lantern has destroyed the peace in our world and is attacking NosVille now too! We don't know what has happened to our parents and friends. I'm so sad!zts16708e	I would love to fight Jack O'Lantern... to get my revenge! But I'm too weak. Can you sort him out for me?zts16709e	Jack O'Lantern is very strong and powerful. You can only defeat him if you join forces with other adventurers and fight together!zts16710e	Yes, I'll defeat Jack O'Lantern with all my strength!zts16711e	If you bring me sweets, I'll swap them for a Halloween Costume Scroll or Jack O'Lantern's Seal!zts16712e	Exchange 10 Yellow Pumpkin Sweets for a Halloween Costume Scrollzts16713e	Exchange 10 Black Pumpkin Sweets for a Halloween Costume Scrollzts16714e	Exchange 30 Yellow Pumpkin Sweets for Jack O'Lantern's Sealzts16715e	Exchange 30 Black Pumpkin Sweets for Jack O'Lantern's Sealzts16716e	If you bring me five Bags of Sweets, I'll give you a Halloween Horror Box!zts16717e	How can you get a Bag of Sweets?zts16718e	Exchange for Halloween Horror Boxzts16719e	How can you get a Bag of Sweets?zts16720e	You can receive this bag by fulfilling the Trick or Treat Quests from the NPCs that will be waiting for you in NosVille during the event.zts16721e	You can receive Trick or Treat Quests from me, Mary, Eva Energy, Teoman Topp or Malcolm Mix.

I'm pleased you like my hat.zts16741e	(Mimi is smiling again and all is well! I'll go back to Malcolm now.)zts16744e	Of course you don't hurt other players by fighting with them.

The Altar of Frozen Heart Citadel will break the curse and give them back the Power of Protection.zts16745e	Hey, you there!

You truly are an extraordinary adventurer, one who knows how important it is to share.zts16803e	W-w-wait adventurer.zts16804e	Sorry, but can you tell Calvin Coach that he should use it to protect himself from catching a cold? Please?!zts16805e	Understood. Don't worry about it!zts16806e	Thanks a lot, adventurer!zts16807e	Wait for me, Calvin! I have a present for you. Soraya told me to give you this scarf with the message that you should use it to protect yourself from the cold.zts16808e	(Calvin seems really pleased with it. I should tell Soraya this!)zts16809e	Of course he was glad to receive it. I think he stopped thinking about his training completely the moment he received it.zts16810e	(Her face is going quite red. I reckon these two are a perfect match for each other.)zts16811e	Hello, Mimi?zts16812e	Oh, hello adventurer. Can I help you with anything?zts16813e	I heard that you are trying to do some good for the poor. It's not much, but I'd like to help, please take my donation.zts16814e	Oh, my utmost gratitude! You have a good heart. I'll be sure to use it for something useful. I wish you all the best!zts16815e	(Mimi is such a good person to be helping those in need. She's so willing to help. I'm going to support her more often.)zts16816e	(I'm going to head back to Teodor.)zts16817e	Soraya, I've managed to collect everything. I hope you're happy with it all.zts16818e	Ah, you're back.

I'm preparing the Easter presents for NosVille, but I need more Easter eggs! Please help me and collect some Red Easter Eggs for me!zts16846e	Accept Daily Quest from Eva Energyzts16847e	Where can I find Red Easter Eggs?zts16848e	You can get them by hunting monsters, however Red Easter Eggs are very rare!zts16849e	Hey, you there! We're organising a big Easter egg hunt over Easter. Do you know anyone who'd like to join in?zts16850e	I've hidden Easter eggs all over the village. If you bring me some Yellow Easter Eggs, I'll give you an Easter present!zts16851e	Accept Daily Quest from Sluggzts16852e	Where can I find Yellow Easter Eggs?zts16853e	Well if I told you that, it'd spoil all the fun!zts16854e	But I'll give you a clue.zts16855e	You will see a couple of things which are somewhat unusual for NosVille, Port Alveus Square and Port Alveus Market!zts16857e	I believe you, adventurer!zts16859e	Thank you, thank you!zts16861e	Finish off the Chicken Queen!zts16864e	Phew... it really isn't easy to find!zts16866e	Great! Here's what I promised you.zts16868e	I have a small gift for Soraya. Could you take it to her?zts16870e	Did she like it?zts16871e	Of course she liked it. She even blushed a little...zts16872e	Oh... thank you, adventurer!zts16874e	I'll wait for you here.zts16876e	Here's my task for you.zts16878e	Oh, what's that? Is that really for me?zts16879e	Calvin asked me to bring it to you as a thank you for the last Christmas present.zts16880e	Oh, really?zts16881e	(Her cheeks start turning red, she really seems to like him.)zts16882e	I should start making my way back now...zts16883e	Hey, wait a second, adventurer! Please give Calvin my sincerest thanks. And thank you for coming.zts16886e	Increase Attack and Defence Powerzts16887e	Improve Food and Snackszts16888e	Reduce Teleportation and Ship Costszts16889e	Improve Potionszts16890e	This effect increases the attack and defence power for family members and their NosMates. When you acquire higher level skills, lower level ones will no longer be applied.zts16891e	This effect increases the effectiveness of food and snacks for family members. The effect does not apply to temporary HP and MP.zts16892e	This effect increases the effectiveness of recovery potions and can be acquired by higher level families. Does not apply to divine potions.zts16893e	When your family reaches a higher level, I recommend you pick up this effect. It reduces the costs of teleportation and ship voyages.zts16896e	Make Lord Draco's Raid Sealzts16897e	Do you have any questions?zts16898e	Tell me a something about the Heroes of Fire.zts16899e	What do you know about Lord Draco?zts16900e	How do I make Lord Draco's Raid Seal?zts16901e	They are the great heroes, the ones that serve the power of fire in an extraordinary manner.  The Gladiator is a swordsman, the Fire Cannoneer belongs to the archers and Volcano is a mage.zts16902e	Lord Draco is an evil lava dragon.zts16903e	Some centuries ago, he drove our world to ruin and chaos broke out. If the seal is broken, he will once again try to destroy everything.zts16904e	Why did god create men and dragons?!zts16907e	I'm afraid that the apocalypse lies before us.zts16908e	What are you talking about?zts16909e	Lord Draco once destroyed our world, long ago. Now his seal is weakening.zts16910e	Is it possible to revitalise the seal?zts16911e	No, unfortunately it is too late for that. I can at least try to delay the seal's destruction. But time is short.zts16912e	So how should we proceed?zts16913e	We must defeat Lord Draco. Otherwise we will be helpless to stop the destruction of our world.zts16914e	I am not strong enough to defeat Lord Draco.zts16915e	I wouldn't expect you to take on this challenge immediately. If you get help from the Heroes of Fire, you should be able to do it.zts16916e	Where are the Heroes of Fire? Can't they just fight against Lord Draco themselves?zts16917e	They already made a great sacrifice, long ago, in order to seal away Lord Draco. Now the onus comes to you.zts16918e	I'll help you to find them if you bring me their personal belongings. You should be able to use their power to gain recognition.zts16919e	First, find Roberto's Helm. Here is a sketch of it. Take it to the Treasure Hunter Camp.zts16920e	Heroes of Fire 2zts16921e	(You show Riana the sketch.)zts16922e	Ah, that's Roberto's Helm.zts16923e	Do you have it?zts16924e	No. We have a lot of treasures here, but by no means all of them!zts16925e	Riana, what's wrong with you? Our Treasure Hunter Camp does own Roberto's Helm.zts16926e	Ah, yes, you're right. But one of the horns has broken off.zts16927e	Well, what should we do about it?zts16928e	We need to attach a new horn. But for that we'll need a Basilisk Horn. They can be really difficult to get hold of, but we need the best possible materials for this helm.zts16929e	Where can I get a Basilisk Horn? Please, tell me already.zts16930e	You look like you're planning to hunt for basilisks?!zts16932e	Heroes of Fire 3zts16933e	You've done a great job. As promised, I will repair the helm for you. It will only take a minute.zts16934e	(Riana returns bearing Roberto's Helm.)zts16935e	Here, take it.zts16936e	I did a pretty good repair job, don't you think? I should be a blacksmith rather than a treasure hunter!zts16937e	Heroes of Fire 4zts16938e	I remember brave Roberto well.zts16939e	Was he strong?zts16940e	He was possibly the strongest swordsman around.zts16941e	But he was most famous for his courage. He feared no man or beast.zts16942e	The next item that I require are Irene's Glasses.zts16943e	As far as I know, the glasses are in the possession of the Akamur Merchants.zts16944e	Heroes of Fire 5zts16945e	Hey there, little one. Do you know where the leader of the Akamur Merchants is?zts16946e	Little one?! I am Nephi and I'm temporarily in charge here.zts16947e	Oops, my mistake. Can you tell me anything about Irene's Glasses?zts16948e	Wait a second, I'll take a look in the books.zts16949e	Nephi, you don't have to do that.zts16950e	Irene's Glasses are the Akamur Merchants' prize possession.zts16951e	I really need them, urgently. Could you give them to me? Or sell them perhaps?zts16952e	We're merchants! We would never let the glasses go without getting something in return.zts16953e	Recently I saw a product that I would like to have. If you can bring it to me, I will trade you Irene's Glasses for it.zts16954e	What do you want?zts16956e	(Wow, Nephi has gotten so grown-up.)zts16957e	Heroes of Fire 6zts16958e	Do you have the Mysterious Sand?zts16959e	(You hand the sand to Nephi.)zts16960e	Yahoo!zts16961e	Semia, go fetch Irene's Glasses and we'll make the trade as promised.zts16962e	Yep, just a second.zts16963e	(After a short while, Semia returns with the glasses.)zts16964e	Here they are...zts16965e	If you have any other requests, you're welcome to visit again.zts16966e	Heroes of Fire 7zts16967e	The ever lively Irene always used to look after her glasses.zts16968e	Are these glasses that special?zts16969e	I think that these glasses are a reminder of her father. So they have a special importance.zts16970e	The memory of her father has been projected onto the glasses.zts16971e	Oh, how moving. I'm coming over all sentimental!zts16972e	Yeah, well. You will get to meet the Heroes of Fire if you bring me Harold's Glove.zts16973e	President Noah has the glove in his possession. You will find him in the Akamur Camp.zts16974e	Heroes of Fire 8zts16975e	Prove your talents if you want to join us.zts16976e	No. I'm only here looking for Harold's Glove.zts16977e	I have it.zts16978e	Ahh. Are you the adventurer that traded the Mysterious Sand for Irene's Glasses with my sister Nephi?zts16979e	My sister's messenger said that you were a rather strong-willed person.zts16980e	If you help me to solve a problem of mine, I will give you Harold's Glove. Are you in?zts16981e	I don't see that I really have a choice...zts16982e	Haha, indeed!zts16983e	I have received information that suggests the sneaky Desert Robbers plan on attacking us Akamur Merchants. It's likely that they have set their sights on my caravan.zts16984e	If you defeat the leaders of the Desert Robbers, I'll give you Harold's Glove.zts16985e	I have to defeat them all on my own?!zts16986e	We're merchants! We would never conduct any business to our disadvantage!zts16987e	Heroes of Fire 9zts16988e	You have returned. Very good. The people of the desert are already talking about your heroic deeds. You truly are a strong warrior. Are you sure you don't want to work with us?zts16989e	I still have some important things to take care of. *wheeze*zts16990e	Oh... alright then. Well, as agreed, here is Harold's Glove.zts16991e	(You accept Harold's Glove from President Noah.)zts16992e	Should you ever change your mind and do end up wanting to join us, you are welcome to come back any time.zts16993e	Heroes of Fire 10zts16994e	(Great Magician Kan looks really tired.)zts16995e	Finally, I'm back. *wheeze*zts16996e	Why are you so tired?zts16997e	I have been trying the entire time to preserve Lord Draco's seal with a spell. But I've slowly reached my limit.zts16998e	I will mobilise the last of my strength so that you can meet the Heroes of Fire. Please give me Harold's Glove.zts16999e	Now, it's probably best if you step back a bit.zts17000e	(Great Magician Kan places a spell on the items you brought and a Time-Space Stone appears.)zts17001e	Good. Now take this stone. When you use it, you will be able to meet the Heroes of Fire. Now go. There's not much time left.zts17002e	Heroes of Fire 11zts17003e	How did Roberto, Irene and Harold become what they now are?zts17004e	You saw them. They saved our world by sacrificing themselves in order to seal away Lord Draco.zts17005e	Those three were true heroes.zts17006e	Ah yes, they gave me this, for you.zts17007e	(You give Roberto's Necklace, Irene's Bracelet and Harold's Ring to Great Magician Kan.)zts17008e	They appreciate your commitment. I note a little of their power in these items.zts17009e	I can't see it.zts17010e	What do you mean? The world is in great danger! You have to save it with the power of these three heroes.zts17011e	But I...zts17012e	(You feel a large wave of pure energy welling up.)zts17013e	The seal has finally broken. You are our last hope!zts17014e	(Great Magician Kan creates the Hero's Amulet of Fire, in which he places the power of the heroes' items.)zts17015e	Now, take this amulet and carry it with you at all times. It will protect you from the Dragon Dread.zts17016e	I beg you, save our world!zts17017e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 1zts17018e	Huh? Where can I find them?zts17019e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 2zts17020e	Arrgh!zts17021e	(You hear a horrifying cry.)zts17022e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 3zts17023e	I think that this surrounded person is Irene. I have to help her.zts17024e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 4zts17025e	Why did you scream so loud? It seems you didn't really need my help after all.zts17026e	Hehe... but I'm afraid of monsters. All the same, thank you.zts17027e	My pleasure.zts17028e	But who are you anyway?zts17029e	I'm just a lowly adventurer.zts17030e	Irene, what are you doing here all on your own?zts17031e	I'm searching for my two friends.zts17032e	Wait... how do you know my name is Irene?zts17033e	My friend told me about you.zts17034e	Hmm, suspicious. But you seem to be a decent person. Alright, I'll tell you.zts17035e	My friends and I once swore to fight against evil. But they left me behind and now I am searching for them.zts17036e	Okay. It's more dangerous searching alone than if there were two of us. Let's search together.zts17037e	Really? Okay, let's go.zts17038e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 5zts17039e	Hey Irene, are your glasses valuable?zts17040e	You were constantly checking they weren't damaged while you were fighting...zts17041e	(Irene's face blushes for a moment and then clears up again.)zts17042e	Yes, they are. They are my most valuable possession.zts17043e	The glasses were left to me by my father.zts17044e	(It's a little embarrassing, but Irene is holding my hand.)zts17045e	Quickly, let's move on.zts17046e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 6zts17047e	Harold! Roberto!zts17048e	Irene?zts17049e	How did you get here?zts17050e	Dammit! You guys left me on my own!zts17051e	Sorry, but it was just far too dangerous.zts17052e	(Hey, we don't have the time for a cosy chin wag!)zts17053e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 7zts17054e	Bah, have we beaten all the monsters?zts17055e	Irene, why are you following us?zts17056e	To help you, of course. I have the power of fire, just the same as you do!zts17057e	But if we should fail, then you need to look after the people.zts17058e	If we cannot defeat Lord Draco, there won't be any people left to protect!zts17059e	Oh my, nobody can stop Irene. Who are you anyway?zts17060e	I am...zts17061e	This is the adventurer who saved my life. He is at least as strong as the two of you.zts17062e	(Roberto and Harold look sceptical.)zts17063e	Thank you for protecting Irene.zts17064e	You're welcome. Actually, I didn't really do anything.zts17065e	You really very modest!zts17066e	Let's head off then and fight the Fiery Achilles.zts17067e	Fiery Achilles?zts17068e	He is the head of an army with great destructive potential.zts17069e	In order to get to Lord Draco, we first need to defeat the Fiery Achilles.zts17070e	Let's get a move on, follow us.zts17071e	(I became their companion in a moment of carelessness.)zts17072e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 8zts17073e	Hey, Roberto, did you know that one of the horns on your helmet is broken?zts17074e	*Roberto touches his helmet in surprise.*zts17075e	Oh, it's actually broken! That is a bad omen to discover just before such an important battle.zts17076e	What do you mean, bad omen? I'll repair your broken horn as soon as we return home.zts17077e	Ha, I'm jealous! Should I go and damage my glove too?zts17078e	Harold! That glove is your most prized possession!zts17079e	Yeah, yeah, I was only joking. This glove is the most valuable thing to me in the whole world.zts17080e	(It seems that there are some stories hidden behind Harold's Glove too.)zts17081e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 9zts17082e	Haha, I didn't expect that you lot would make it this far.zts17083e	We're going to defeat you and then head on to your boss!zts17084e	Hahaha. You will never get to meet him.zts17085e	Erm, just so that we're clear, we don't want to shake his hand. We're going to smash him!zts17086e	Rubbish! You won't get to face him until the next life!zts17087e	I think you underestimate us quite severely!zts17088e	(Ahh! I could have said something witty too... such terrible timing!)zts17089e	The Heroes of Fire's Time-Space 10zts17090e	(A terrifying roar can be heard in the distance.)zts17091e	Hey, adventurer, you should probably turn back here.zts17092e	What? Why should I turn back on my own now? We made it this far together!zts17093e	You can't help us. Even though you do fit into our group quite well.zts17094e	But you need to have the power of fire, just as we do, if you're not to be consumed by the Dragon Dread.zts17095e	Dr... Dragon Dread?zts17096e	The dragon instils his enemies with such terror that they become completely petrified. Normal people cannot withstand it.zts17097e	Only we are able to handle it.zts17098e	But...zts17099e	Nothing is impossible! We can defeat him!zts17100e	(At that moment, Roberto hits you on the back of the head.)zts17101e	(You collapse on the ground and only hear the last words very faintly.)zts17102e	We only had a short time together, but thanks for everything, my friend.zts17103e	Hopefully we'll see this hero again some day...zts17104e	Don't forget us!zts17105e	(Irene places a few things in your hand.)zts17106e	(Nooooooo!)zts17107e	(Your eyes slowly close.)zts17108e	I will make the Lord Draco's Raid Seal if you bring me 20x Seeds of Power, 20x Dona River Sand and 20x Gillion Stones.zts17109e	You can acquire the Basilisk Horn from level 80. If you bring it to me, I will repair the helm for you.zts17110e	I want Mysterious Sand. You can get it from the Sand Dwarves at the Temple Site. Bring me this sand.zts17111e	Do you want to test your luck? Then play me for the Pirate SP! But give me part of the Pirate SP and 1,000 gold first!zts17112e	Captain Jack Panonzts17113e	It's not easy being such a fantastic seaman!zts17115e	Get going and drive Captain Pete O'Peng's crew to hell!zts17116e	Okay, I'll believe you.zts17117e	Level 75 - Heroes of Firezts17118e	Maybe you'll get a straw hat.zts17119e	Leonazts17120e	Hey, wait a minute...zts17121e	(Who is this woman?)zts17122e	Do you want to fight Captain Pete O'Peng? Then take me with you, I've got a bone to pick with him!zts17124e	You don't need to know that...zts17125e	That's no good basis for going into battle together, if we don't trust each other!zts17126e	But I can help you! I'm a fantastic markswoman with 100% accuracy!zts17127e	No, I don't need your help! I need to go now. Bye.zts17128e	Yes, I do! But what happened to you?zts17156e	I don't think that will work. I need some new inspiration. Bring me something from the Jack O'Lantern Raid which might give me some new ideas.zts17157e	These days everyone in the village is w... w... wearing these smart glo... glowing pumpkin hats. They look very f... funny. Put one on and show it to Mimi Mentor.zts17158e	When hunting monsters, you can collect Pumpkin Syrup from them. Would you please bring me some?zts17159e	If you bring me a Bag of Sweets, I'll swap them for Jack O'Lantern's Seal. Plus I'll also give you the Halloween Blessing.zts17160e	Yes, I want to swap it for Jack O'Lantern's Seal.zts17161e	Would you fight against Jack O'Lantern's Henchmen for us?zts17164e	Happy New Year! What do you have planned for 2016?zts17165e	With the bell you can catch the young Rudi Rowdy, Super Santa Bushi and others. It won't work with Rudi Rowdy or Abominable Rudolph though.zts17166e	I will give you a Christmas Gift Box with various useful items in it, if you bring me 5 Christmas Stockings!zts17167e	Exchange for Christmas Gift Boxzts17168e	Flake the Snow Fairyzts17169e	Level 20 - The Viking Familyzts17170e	Look there, a Snow Fairy!zts17171e	(I'm going to try to talk to her.)zts17173e	Huh?zts17174e	Please help me!zts17175e	What's wrong? Are you hurt?zts17176e	My body is melting, please bring me some ice!zts17177e	Ice? How much do you need?zts17178e	Get as much as you can! But for a start 5 Ice Cubes will do.zts17179e	(You give Flake the Ice Cubes.)zts17180e	Phew, thanks a lot!zts17181e	Are you alright?zts17182e	Yes and I'm very grateful to you.zts17183e	Could you please do me a big favour?zts17184e	The Huge Snowman Head and his followers have raided the peaceful Viking village and absorbed all of the Vikings' souls.zts17185e	I could only save Barni's family and bring them here.zts17186e	But their souls are becoming weaker and weaker, the more I melt. They might even die because of it.zts17187e	How can I help?zts17188e	Help me to awaken their souls.zts17189e	Errr... okay. I'll do my best.zts17190e	Ask Malcolm Mix how you can awaken them.zts17191e	Oh... that is difficult. I'm not sure... I think Calvin Coach can explain it to you properly.zts17192e	Alright, thank you.zts17193e	Ask Calvin Coach how you can awaken the souls of the Viking family.zts17194e	Hmm... I think they can be awoken by a typical Viking melody. Not certain though.zts17195e	A Viking melody? Huh?zts17196e	Yes, although only their souls have remained, they can be resurrected with a familiar sound.zts17197e	(I must ask Flake about this Viking melody business.)zts17198e	Have you found a way?zts17199e	Yes, I found out that they can be awakened with a Viking melody. It isn't certain that it will work though.zts17200e	Barni's family are Vikings. Maybe a Summoning Horn is what is he meant with a Viking melody.zts17201e	Aha! I will go and get one at once.zts17202e	Please hurry!zts17203e	What do you need?zts17204e	A Viking Summoning Horn.zts17205e	I only deal in weapons and equipment. But I could make one especially for you.zts17206e	Haha... let me guess. You won't do it for free, right?zts17207e	Haha! Right! For starters you should bring me the material I need to make it.zts17208e	What do you need?zts17209e	I need 5x Normal Wood, 5x Normal Leather and 20x Dona River Sand. C'mon, get a move on!zts17210e	Okay, I'm on my way!zts17211e	Oh, that was quick!zts17212e	Haha... as ever. I'll wait here.zts17213e	(After what feels like an eternity Teoman finally returns with the Summoning Horn.)zts17214e	Here you go!zts17215e	Amazing! Thank you, thank you so much!zts17216e	You're very welcome. But next time bring me weapons or equipment.zts17217e	Flake, I've got the Summoning Horn!zts17218e	Wonderful news! You are just in time, the souls of Barni's family are already very weak.zts17219e	If it's too late, their souls will die.zts17220e	Come on, let's wake them up!zts17221e	Blow into the Summoning Horn and aim it towards me!zts17222e	Boohoohoo!zts17223e	(Soon afterwards three orbs of light can be seen and the souls of the Viking family appear.)zts17224e	Err?zts17225e	Enemies ahead! I'll cut you in half!zts17226e	Calm down, darling!zts17227e	Wow, they are so brave, just as Vikings always are!zts17228e	Barni!zts17229e	Flake?!zts17230e	Oh Flake, I'm so happy to see you here in heaven.zts17231e	Barni! Look around. We're not in heaven.zts17232e	Oh... right...zts17233e	Please tell us what happened.zts17234e	Flake managed to escape from the Huge Snowman Head with your souls.zts17235e	But the situation remained critical. Your souls would have passed on, if Flake's body had melted.zts17236e	So she asked me for me help.zts17237e	Oh, that's why.zts17238e	Flake, adventurer, thank you for rescuing me and my family.zts17239e	Barni, you have great friends!zts17240e	Haha! Yes indeed!zts17241e	Now it's time to get our revenge.zts17242e	Adventurer! We are going back to the Viking village to take our revenge on the Huge Snowman!zts17243e	It's an act of destiny! I trust you. Help us to destroy the monsters. We will go on ahead, just follow us.zts17244e	(Before you can answer, their souls have vanished.)zts17245e	Oh... but can I really help them?zts17246e	(You tell Flake the Snow Fairy everything you experienced in the Time-Space.)zts17247e	Oh, that is so sad. I wonder if I'll see them again in heaven?zts17248e	For me they will live on forever.zts17249e	They will make my partner stronger with the power of their souls.zts17250e	Ah, adventurer, please look after my friend Barni.zts17251e	No need to worry about that.zts17252e	Oops! I can't stay here. The Huge Snowman came here through the Time-Space.zts17253e	I shall destroy that monstrosity with the help of my friends!zts17254e	Brave Flake! I hope I shall see you again.zts17255e	First I must ask Malcolm Mix.zts17257e	Wow, there's tons of snow on the ground here.zts17258e	Yippee, I can build a beautiful snowman.zts17259e	(You didn't have much time to build a snowman.)zts17260e	Oh darn, I don't have time to play around. The Viking family needs my help.zts17262e	(Hmm, those little snowmen look like the children of the nasty Huge Snowman.)zts17264e	(Phew, that was hard. I wasn't expecting such a strong attack.)zts17265e	It's going to get even harder, if I don't find the Viking family soon.zts17267e	Oh, here you are!zts17268e	Why are you so late? Were you playing around in the snow too much?zts17269e	Oh, of course not. *grin*zts17270e	Your stuttering is making me suspicious.zts17271e	Silly! You should have wiped the snow from your trousers first!zts17272e	Doesn't matter. Welcome, adventurer! Did you have any problems on the way here?zts17273e	Oh boy, let's not talk about that. It was pretty difficult, because I was attacked by lots of little Snowmen.zts17274e	No need to worry. I'm going to smash them through the air with my frying pan!zts17275e	And I'll get them with my bow.zts17276e	Mwahaha. And I'll show them the Iron Viking!zts17277e	Oh, I don't think I'll have a chance to destroy the monsters.zts17278e	Hahaha! You can just cheer us on.zts17280e	Only kidding! You're a good fighter.zts17281e	I thought you were just a weakling, but I realised now that you're a great warrior.zts17282e	I saw straight away that he is courageous and brave, just like the great warriors of old.zts17283e	Hahaha. I remember that he said that he couldn't see any way of destroying the monsters.zts17284e	(My cheeks are turning bright red. How embarrassing!)zts17285e	That's enough! Let us move on quickly.zts17286e	Why so shy?zts17288e	Barni, who taught you how to use a bow?zts17289e	My father, of course.zts17290e	Oh, you are really talented.zts17291e	Hehe, but he is even more talented at calling my capabilities childlike.zts17292e	Mother!zts17294e	Do you usually get a lot of snow?zts17295e	None at all! And all because of that mean Huge Snowman Head!zts17296e	Why? Do you like snow that much?zts17297e	No, no.zts17298e	(It's going to get serious if I tell the truth.)zts17300e	(There are Snowmen standing all around.)zts17301e	Oh boy, that's a lot!zts17302e	I can't believe it... Were there that many last time?zts17303e	Father...zts17304e	Just when everyone was feeling a certain sense of despair about ever getting out of this situation, there was suddenly a bright flash and Snow Fairies appeared.zts17305e	Flake asked if we could come here to help you. Go to the village, we'll take care of the monsters.zts17306e	They all look just like Flake.zts17308e	Hoho... who do we have here? The hero of the Vikings or what?zts17309e	You...zts17310e	Haha, what a shame!zts17311e	I can't fight you, even if you've come all the way here specially.zts17312e	What a coward! Are you just going to run away?zts17313e	Mwahaha... run away? Very funny! I'm not afraid of you!zts17314e	Hoho... he looks a little dangerous.zts17315e	(Who? Me?)zts17316e	Darn it! Eat my axe!zts17317e	That was really stupid of you! Here, play with my companions! Time for me to go into the Time-Space and absorb more souls!zts17318e	Oh Viking Gods! To NosVille?zts17319e	Mwahaha... is that NosVille?zts17320e	Thanks for the tip!zts17321e	Stupid Vikings! You are going to be wiped out if you carry on like this!zts17322e	Wiped out? What are you talking about?zts17323e	Yeah, yeah, we know.zts17324e	Okay. So you want your revenge?zts17325e	Just to mention... I'm very busy. My followers will take care of you!zts17326e	Aaaaaahhhhhhh!zts17327e	Wait!zts17328e	(Aegir's axe slices through the air.)zts17329e	Wuah, dammit!zts17330e	(The Huge Snowman Head says that the souls of Barni's family will be wiped out. I wonder what will happen... I'll think about it some more when the monsters have been dealt with.)zts17332e	Hey Aegir! What does he mean by 'wiped out'?zts17333e	Well, it's true...zts17334e	...our souls will die.zts17335e	Oh...zts17336e	We have used up all our Viking powers. We would die even if we didn't fight against the Snowmen.zts17337e	Mother, father... I don't regret anything.zts17338e	Exactly, my son!zts17339e	*sobs* That is soo sad and too much for me.zts17340e	Don't cry!zts17341e	Don't cry, adventurer!zts17342e	*sobs* Silly, don't cry! Don't cry!zts17343e	What am I going to tell Flake?zts17344e	Please tell her: 'Goodbye my friend'!zts17345e	Adventurer! I swear on my holy Viking name AEGIR:zts17346e	Even though nothing shall remain of our family but our souls, we shall always look out for you!zts17347e	Before our souls completely vanish forever, we shall combine all our strength and pass it on to you.zts17348e	*sobs* What are you talking about?zts17349e	We cannot part like this!zts17350e	This is not goodbye!zts17351e	This way we can be together forever.zts17352e	Hehe, this way we can see each other again, sooner or later. Please use my skills when battling against anyone who is good with a bow and arrow.zts17353e	Bye, bye...zts17354e	(The souls of the Vikings turn into sparkling stars and vanish in the blink of an eye.)zts17355e	(Now here I am standing all alone on the snow-covered ground. But I don't feel the cold any more, as Barni's family will always be with me.)zts17356e	Ice? Perhaps I can snatch some from the monsters in Glacernon. How much do you need?zts17363e	You can use this to summon Young Rudi Rowdy, the Super Santa Bushi, the Docile Yeti and other monsters and then tame them with a Bell. However, this does not work for Rudi Rowdy or the Abominable Rudolph.zts17364e	There is no such thing as a free lunch anywhere in the world! I've actually got all the materials I need for the production. Please bring me something that I really need in return and I will produce the Summoning Horn for you.zts17365e	What do you need?zts17366e	I want to give some gifts to a few people who don't have families and are alone at Christmas.zts17367e	Please bring me 5 Fresh Cream Cakes and 5 Chocolate Cakes.zts17368e	Wow! Is that really enough?zts17369e	Of course.zts17370e	Okay, I will.zts17371e	Here are the letters for the word (10x) H.A.P.P.Y!zts17372e	I have collected the letters for (10x) N.E.W. Y.E.A.R!zts17375e	Felix Frostzts17376e	Level 75 - Glacerus the Ice Coldzts17377e	Go to Glacerus' Cavezts17378e	Create Raid Sealzts17379e	What do you want to know?zts17380e	Tell me something about the ice cold beast, Glacerus.zts17381e	How did you get to Desert Eagle City?zts17382e	How can I get Glacerus' Raid Seal?zts17383e	Rumour has it that Glacerus once suffocated the whole world with ice and snow.zts17384e	I've been travelling around for a long time, trying to find a way to lift the curse of Glacernon. That's how I ended up here in Desert Eagle City.zts17385e	I will create Glacerus' Raid Seal for you if you give me 20 Seeds of Power, 20 Ice Cubes and 20 Ice Flowers.zts17386e	Frozen Soulstonezts17387e	Return Borrowed Powerzts17388e	Quest: The Destruction of Glacerus' Ice Sealzts17389e	Oh, you...zts17390e	Yes?zts17391e	<pname>, you're the adventurer who brought Lord Draco to justice, aren't you?zts17392e	Hehe, yes... that's me. I'm <pname> and I brought down Lord Draco.zts17393e	Then I've found you at last.zts17394e	First of all, my name is Felix Frost. I'm Fabian's twin brother and I travelled the whole world in search of a way to lift the curse of Glacernon. I'm acting under Aurelius Roshu's orders.zts17395e	Okay, Felix. But why have you been looking for me?zts17396e	I have a request for you, <pname>.zts17397e	Aha, and what's that?zts17398e	I recently discovered something similar to a glacier in the Chaos Zone.zts17399e	A glacier in the desert, can you believe it?!zts17400e	But it really is unbelievable... that thing hasn't melted even though it's so hot there.zts17401e	Don't you think it's suspicious that it doesn't melt?!zts17402e	Yes, of course! I've been examining this block of ice for some time now, but still haven't found an explanation for it.zts17403e	And...?zts17404e	I returned to Desert Eagle City and asked around in the Treasure Hunter Camp, but I was unsuccessful.zts17405e	In the meantime, I heard through the grapevine about your deeds and eventually found you, <pname>.zts17406e	Erm, where is this glacier thing?zts17407e	It's to the north-east of the Chaos Zone.zts17408e	I'll take a closer look at it.zts17409e	Thanks a lot. But be careful, there are swarms of dangerous monsters hanging around near the Chaos Zone.zts17410e	Wow! That really does look like a glacier... err, well, more like a big block of ice. I don't believe it.zts17411e	That really is strange. I need to take a closer look.zts17412e	(You touch the icy soulstone with your hand. Suddenly your whole body is immersed in a mysterious liquid and you faint.)zts17413e	(Thirty minutes later...)zts17414e	What happened? I think I blacked out.zts17415e	Yes, you were gone for a while there.zts17416e	(You look around, but there's no one there.)zts17417e	What... who? Are you a ghost?zts17418e	We are souls... usually we just can't be seen.zts17419e	S... souls?zts17420e	Alright, that's enough! Let's introduce ourselves properly first.zts17421e	Hello! I'm Zangpo, a Battle Monk from the Temple of the Blue Dragon. The one with the enchanting voice is the beautiful Tide Lady Elisia and the cheeky chappy is our Scout Falco.zts17422e	We're ancient souls. We sealed Glacerus the Ice Cold long, long ago. That was a very hard task. Afterwards we found our peace in this Frozen Soulstone.zts17423e	Some time ago, however, this world was overwhelmed by a mystical wave and Glacerus' seal was broken. That's why we have risen.zts17424e	Glacerus the Ice Cold?!zts17425e	He is a beast that has smothered our world in snow and ice.zts17426e	That's terrible!zts17427e	Luckily he is still quite weak, as the seal was only recently destroyed. So he's isolating himself with an Ice Seal, so he can regain his power.zts17428e	And now's the perfect time to destroy the Ice Seal and Glacerus himself. Am I right?zts17429e	Yes, that's right. But there's an issue with destroying Glacerus' Ice Seal.zts17430e	What issue?zts17431e	The area that the Ice Seal is on does not allow any power to enter, apart from the powers we possess.zts17432e	Use our powers to break the Ice Seal.zts17433e	If you bring our magic items back to us, we can transfer our skills onto you.zts17434e	Okay, what should I get first?zts17435e	Find my Buddhist Prayer Beads first.zts17436e	(I should go to Felix Frost first and ask him what he thinks about it.)zts17437e	(You talk to Felix about the old souls.)zts17438e	I've heard about this Glacerus... Aurelius Roshu told me about him.zts17439e	It would be a seriously major problem if he were back again.zts17440e	But with the power of the old souls you can seal Glacerus away again.zts17441e	But you'll need those magic items to reactivate this power. Have you ever heard of Buddhist Prayer Beads?zts17442e	Yes, they belong to the Battle Monk Zangpo.zts17443e	I'm not sure, but I heard that Riana found something like an old relic some time ago.zts17444e	Ah, in that case I'll go to the Treasure Hunter Camp first.zts17445e	Ahh! You came back to repair some equipment.zts17446e	Haha... no.zts17447e	This time I'm looking for something special.zts17448e	Really? That's a shame! What is it that you're looking for then?zts17449e	Have you got Zangpo's Buddhist Prayer Beads?zts17450e	No, I haven't. You must have misunderstood something.zts17451e	But luckily I can give you some information about them.zts17452e	Information?zts17453e	Yes. We have an inkling about where they might be.zts17454e	Go right ahead!zts17455e	Not so fast, dummy! You don't get anything for nothing in this life. You'll have to pay a fee for this information.zts17456e	Umm, how much?zts17457e	Hmm... let's see. Zangpo's Buddhist Prayer Beads are a unique commodity. Let's say 100,000 Gold.zts17458e	When you have gathered this sum, go to Serena.zts17459e	Exactly 100,000 Gold. Please wait a minute.zts17460e	I'm only going to read out what's on the scroll once, so listen very carefully!zts17461e	[Zangpo's Buddhist Prayer Beads] They were in the possession of Professor Asim before he lost them while crossing the desert. Now the holy item is presumed to be with the thieving Desert Sand Foxes.zts17462e	That's it. Good luck to you!zts17463e	That's it?! How can that useless information be worth 100,000 Gold? What a crook!zts17464e	Phew... I finally have them. I'd best go straight to Zangpo.zts17465e	You've got them! I can feel the energy of my prayer beads.zts17466e	(After he finally has them back, Zangpo immediately puts the chain around his neck.)zts17467e	Thank you. These Buddhist Prayer Beads are elementary to my beliefs.zts17468e	Beliefs?zts17469e	Whenever I'm unable to calm down, I take these prayer beads in my hands and can virtually feel my spiritual strength returning.zts17470e	Oh, then they must mean a lot to you.zts17471e	Hey! Enough about that, now it's my turn... uh... my item.zts17472e	What should I find for you?zts17473e	My training gloves. Please bring them back to me.zts17474e	Training gloves? Seriously?zts17475e	Yes, yes, quick... find them!zts17476e	(I'll ask Felix if he knows anything.)zts17477e	Felix, do you know anything about Falco's Training Gloves?zts17478e	Hmm... I think Velmon has them. You can find him near the Chaos Zone.zts17479e	Thanks. But are you absolutely sure?zts17480e	Certainly. I got to find out a lot of things when I was investigating the curse over Glacernon.zts17481e	Ah, right! Okay, I'll go to Velmon.zts17482e	Be careful! It's the Chaos Zone.zts17483e	Where are you from?zts17484e	You look so different. What are you doing here?zts17485e	I'll just come right out with it.zts17486e	Have you got Falco's Training Gloves?zts17487e	(Hmm, he's wearing a strange expression on his face after hearing my question.)zts17488e	So, you're after the gloves are you? Go ahead, try and steal them. I'm not that easy to outwit, even if I look that way!zts17489e	Oh, there's been a misunderstanding. I need them, but I'm not here to steal them.zts17490e	Have you maybe got something to offer in exchange?zts17491e	I really desperately need the gloves, so I'll give you anything you want.zts17492e	You're very determined. Okay, if you do me a favour, I'll give them to you.zts17493e	This region, the Chaos Zone, is very dangerous.zts17494e	I've discovered that Commander Garton's Elite Troops want to invade the Chaos Zone.zts17495e	Raid Garton's Camp and bring me the Chaos Zone Attack Order. The document is most likely on Garton's person.zts17496e	He'll be tricky, but I'm sure you'll manage.zts17497e	Alright, if it means we can complete our trade, I'll go there and take care of it.zts17498e	So far, so good. The raid was successful. Now I just need to find these orders for the attack on the Chaos Zone.zts17499e	I've finally got the Chaos Zone Attack Order. Now back to Velmon.zts17500e	You were obviously successful.zts17501e	But first I want to check the document over. Show me the orders for the attack on the Chaos Zone.zts17502e	(You give Velmon the Chaos Zone Attack Order.)zts17503e	As expected, they really are planning a raid on this area.zts17504e	Thank you very much. You put your life on the line for our agreement, so now I'm going to fulfil my side of the deal.zts17505e	Here, take them.zts17506e	(Velmon gives you Falco's Training Gloves.)zts17507e	I should go to Falco now.zts17508e	Hey Falco! I've got them, your training gloves.zts17509e	Wow, you were quick. Thank you. Levin can finally sit on my hand again.zts17510e	Levin?zts17511e	Levin is his falcon. They grew up together, so he's Falco's family.zts17512e	Either way, up to now you have been fantastic. You found Zangpo and Falco's valuable things so quickly. Can I rely on your help too?zts17513e	Hmm. Tell me what it's about first, Elisia.zts17514e	It's about my hair accessory. It's very easy to recognise, because it's decorated with a big sapphire.zts17515e	Go on...zts17516e	A sapphire is a rare gemstone, so the hair accessory is very valuable.zts17517e	Ah yes, I understand.zts17518e	I believe in you, <pname>.zts17519e	I hope you won't get any stupid ideas when you find it.zts17520e	Haha... of course not.zts17521e	(Felix will probably want to know about this.)zts17522e	What is the last item?zts17523e	It concerns Elisia's hair accessory. Do you know anything about it?zts17524e	Sure. Everyone knows about it.zts17525e	Some time ago, the head of the Akamur Quarter, Nephi, prided herself on her hair accessories.zts17526e	And what is the situation NOW?zts17527e	After the Desert Robber Band targeted her because of it, she got a scolding from her brother. I've heard nothing more about it since then.zts17528e	Whatever, she seems to have Elisia's Hair Accessory, so I'm going to go to the Akamur Quarter.zts17529e	Oh, welcome back <pname>! You were the one who brought me Mysterious Sand once. How can I help you?zts17530e	Hehe, so you remember me, little one?zts17531e	Hey, don't call me that! I'm Nephi, the ruler of the Akamur Quarter.zts17532e	Oh... excuse me!zts17533e	So, what do you want here?zts17534e	I'm looking for Elisia's Hair Accessory.zts17535e	Umm... you're not serious, are you?zts17536e	Please give me some exact details first.zts17537e	As I've already said, I came here to find Elisia's Hair Accessory.zts17538e	Do you actually know how valuable that thing is?zts17539e	I'm willing to pay whatever necessary.zts17540e	You're very confident. But as is typical for us, we don't trade if we can't make a profit from it.zts17541e	What should I get for you?zts17542e	That sounds better. Bring me as many Ice Flowers from Glacernon as you can carry.zts17543e	Yeah right! Nobody can move on Glacernon because of the curse. Nephi, are you trying to pull the adventurer's leg?zts17544e	Okay, I'll do my best.zts17545e	Seriously? You're getting Ice Flowers for me?zts17546e	Of course.zts17547e	I'll check they're authentic.zts17548e	(You give Representative Semia the Ice Flowers.)zts17549e	Nephi... these here are definitely real.zts17550e	Wow! You're better than I thought. I was getting bored of this old thing anyway. Semia, get Elisia's Hair Accessory and give it to the little hero here, as promised.zts17551e	(After a while Semia returns with Elisia's Hair Accessory.)zts17552e	Thank you very much, Nephi, ruler of the Akamur Quarter.zts17553e	You're welcome. Trust is an important commodity. Bye for now.zts17554e	You did it! But quick now, we don't have much time.zts17555e	(You give Elisia back her hair accessory.)zts17556e	Wait a minute...zts17557e	(After Elisia has fused the items into one, she uses her magic energy and creates a Specialist Card.)zts17558e	Take it.zts17559e	Wow, I can feel a new power inside of me.zts17560e	You cannot use the power for very long, it will be exhausted after a short time.zts17561e	Please only use it to destroy Glacerus' Ice Seal!zts17562e	Before, there are lots of enemies are protecting the Ice Seal.zts17563e	Avoid unnecessary fighting and concentrate on destroying Glacerus' Ice Seal quickly.zts17564e	Perhaps a NosMate should help you out.zts17565e	You returned safely. Did you destroy the Ice Seal?zts17566e	Strong fighters were protecting it, but I still managed to do it.zts17567e	Now there's just one last thing left to do - defeat Glacerus himself!zts17568e	Give us back our newly gained powers.zts17569e	Couldn't I also use them to destroy Glacerus?zts17570e	Probably, but the power is already disappearing.zts17572e	Ice Storm?zts17573e	I actually did feel an icy coldness after destroying Glacerus' Ice Seal, much worse than it usually is on Glacernon.zts17574e	It's Glacerus' Ice Storm which freezes everything and everyone.zts17575e	But how can I actually give back the power?zts17576e	First, you undo the transformation and put the card back with your equipment.zts17577e	And then?zts17578e	Go to the Frozen Soulstone and select 'Return Borrowed Power'.zts17580e	The Scroll of Icy Coldness is protected by a frost spell. This can only be lifted by a Blue Magician.zts17581e	(I'd best go to Felix Frost first, tell him what happened in the Time-Space and show him the Scroll of Icy Coldness.)zts17582e	This is a scroll with an ice spell on it. Just a minute.zts17583e	*Felix uses his magic power on the scroll and the parchment turns into a seal.*zts17584e	What happened there?zts17585e	Don't worry. I've taken note of Glacerus' whereabouts, they were written on the scroll.zts17586e	Take the seal.zts17587e	(Felix gives you Glacerus' Raid Seal.)zts17588e	It's impossible to defeat Glacerus alone. Look for some brave comrades and use this seal.zts17589e	Thank you so much, Felix.zts17590e	You're welcome. Good luck!zts17591e	(This is the Time-Space Stone for destroying Glacerus' Ice Seal.)zts17592e	(They say only their power is effective.)zts17593e	(I need to turn into a specialist and use the help of their powers.)zts17594e	An intruder has been discovered. Report this to Laraneya as soon as possible.zts17595e	Drat! Keeping a low profile didn't work.zts17596e	The enemy is alone, but powerful. Call reinforcements, immediately!zts17597e	What are you talking about? It's impossible to achieve anything with normal powers here.zts17598e	Haha, idiot! My powers are anything but normal!zts17599e	How could you allow the enemy to infiltrate?zts17600e	Maybe he's using the power of the ancient souls?!zts17601e	Impossible! I heard they died whilst sealing away Glacerus?zts17602e	Aha... so you're the infiltrator who was reported to me.zts17603e	Yes, that's right. I only came here with one aim - to destroy Glacerus' Ice Seal!zts17604e	Haha... and you think you can handle that?!zts17605e	Absolutely! We'll settle the rest later!zts17606e	Everyone: protect Glacerus' Ice Seal with your lives! That's an order!zts17607e	Are you running away now?zts17608e	Haha... You think... I'm not going to let you provoke me.zts17609e	Glacerus' Ice Seal is a lot more valuable than your pathetic excuse of a life.zts17610e	(After Glacerus' Ice Seal is destroyed, a violent ice storm arrives.)zts17611e	Oh, a t-t-terrible ice storm is coming. If I s-s-stay here, I'll be an ice c-c-cube soon.

What do you have planned for 2014?zts17697e	Sarakaelzts17698e	Do you know the Mysterious Traveller?zts17699e	Mysterious Traveller? Yes, he died in the Region of the Burning Sword.zts17700e	That's what we thought as well. We were prepared to judge his soul.zts17701e	But his soul was nowhere to be found. It's possible he's still alive.zts17702e	(No way! I saw him die with my own eyes!)zts17703e	Who are you anyway?zts17704e	I am one of the Skykeepers, responsible for guarding the souls.zts17705e	You mean... an angel?zts17706e	His soul must be judged by the heavens.zts17707e	It must be a result of the influence of dark forces. Against God's plans.zts17708e	Dark forces?zts17709e	Yes. They are against God and his plans.zts17710e	(Maybe demons...)zts17711e	It looks like they planned to resurrect the Mysterious Traveller.zts17712e	Recently we've been able to detect some forces of darkness in Glacernon. They're obviously trying to bring Caligor into this world...zts17713e	No, no way. That can't be allowed to happen.zts17714e	(What's he talking about?)zts17715e	Forces of darkness? Caligor?zts17716e	There's no more time, child. Please investigate these dark forces!zts17717e	Huh? But why me...?zts17718e	I am one of the Skykeepers! Refusing my request is equivalent to rebelling against God's will.zts17719e	Apart from that, you will be lost if Caligor appears in this world. So get a move on! Go already!zts17720e	(I can't believe it...)zts17721e	I can read your thoughts, child!zts17722e	What the hell? Since we're talking of hell... I guess I'd better head off on this 'wonderful' journey... yet again!zts17723e	Lilithzts17724e	.........zts17725e	Have we met?zts17726e	Hey, hi... c'mon already!zts17727e	Have you received the message yet?zts17728e	The message?zts17729e	Sometimes I visit this middle world and find a problem that needs solving. It's precisely these adventures I'm looking for.zts17730e	The middle world...zts17731e	We sent certain special souls back as part of our plan, but they don't obey me. Bah!zts17732e	Aside from which, they've stolen a number of jewels which shouldn't even have existed here.zts17733e	Jewels?zts17734e	Yes, jewels! Here in the middle world these jewels give the people unbelievable powers. That's why they're looking for them.zts17735e	(Jewels... they must be used for upgrading. Probably very difficult to get hold of them.)zts17736e	Whatever. Could you punish these little thieves for me?zts17737e	You needn't bring the jewels back to me. I merely want them to be punished!zts17738e	If you agree, I'll ensure you never have nightmares ever again! Haha!zts17739e	(I think that's supposed to be some kind of threat...)zts17740e	Well, I don't have nightmares anyway... not really.zts17741e	I'm not going to play word games with you. You'll never again enjoy the feeling of sweet dreams if you reject my offer!zts17742e	Whaaat?! I thought that was supposed to be your cry for help?zts17743e	I live in the Devil's Cathedral and everyone calls me Queen of the Succubi! Believe it or not.zts17744e	If you prefer not to believe me, let's just see what happens in your dreams. How about that?zts17745e	Hmm... I think it's pretty much a win for you either way, since you get to pick up the jewels, right?zts17746e	Oh... that isn't good at all!zts17747e	Sarakael's Offerzts17748e	Caligor has appeared after all.zts17749e	The Mysterious Traveller has already completed the transition.zts17750e	I understand.zts17751e	Here is my offer to you, child.zts17752e	Offer?zts17753e	Yes. I am the Guardian of Souls. I judge them.zts17754e	I also guide them, to prevent further wrongdoings.zts17755e	If the people ally themselves to defeat Caligor, I will help them and give them unimaginable powers.zts17756e	What do we need to do?zts17757e	You will receive Caligor's Spirit once he has been destroyed. Bring it to me.zts17758e	(Caligor's Spirit... surely that won't be easy?)zts17759e	Do you want to try?zts17760e	Lilith's Whisperzts17761e	Oh, you're back. Have you dealt with her?zts17762e	I have... but something new has emerged called Caligor.zts17763e	Oh no, Caligor is here?zts17764e	That pest causes trouble everywhere!zts17765e	(That's one extremely powerful pest!)zts17766e	That's why these little thieves are doing evil things.zts17767e	Very well, he's already appeared. What should we do? My Lord is always saying he must be destroyed.zts17768e	I think this might be the opportunity. Can you deal with Caligor?zts17769e	What?!zts17770e	Why so surprised? If he remains in your world, nothing and no one will be safe.zts17771e	It isn't that easy!zts17772e	Oh, child... you don't have to tell me that. But I promise to reward you generously. How about that? Interested now?zts17773e	Not on your life! And don't even consider threatening me. It won't work. Not a chance!zts17774e	Come on, listen to me!zts17775e	When you confront him... errr... how does the story go again... Once upon a time there were venerable heroes amongst your ancestors who devoted themselves to the shadow element.zts17776e	They were truly unforgettable heroes... really, it was such a very long time ago. But they disappeared without a trace. Fortunately, their souls were transferred to us.zts17777e	Anyway, to cut a long story short, I would entrust these souls to you. How does that sound?zts17778e	Venerable heroes?zts17779e	Child, I've already told you how busy I am. Go and destroy him!zts17780e	Oh, and don't forget to bring back Caligor's Spirit!zts17781e	Caligor's Spirit?zts17782e	Yes, you will be in a position to capture his spirit once you have defeated him. Simply bring it back to me.zts17783e	Then I can bring my Lord the joyful tidings.zts17784e	All right. I'll be waiting for you here.zts17785e	Mr Park's First Sonzts17786e	Fresh Liver Please!zts17787e	Foxy's Verdictzts17788e	Our parents always wanted to have a daughter...zts17789e	The God of the Mountain listened to their prayers... and then finally, my younger sister was born...zts17790e	But I simply couldn't believe the legend was true. Don't ask me why, but... could you bring me some Fresh Liver?zts17791e	Please... I need it for my survival!zts17792e	Okay, I'll bring you some.zts17793e	I haven't seen my parents for several days...zts17794e	I feel so ill... was that not... enough liver?zts17795e	Eeeeeevil Foxyzts17796e	Hey, would you avenge my parents?zts17797e	Yes, I'll vanquish that nine-tailed fox creature.zts17798e	It doesn't matter whether human or animal...zts17799e	Just as long as I get some Fresh Liver!zts17800e	Th-th-thanks! This lot will keep my sister mellow for a few days.zts17801e	Why have you come back? Was it as difficult as expected?zts17802e	Did you really defeat Foxy? I'll never forget you for that!zts17803e	Mr Park's Second Sonzts17804e	Fox Huntzts17805e	Someone Who Knows the Truthzts17806e	I simply can't sleep with all that fox howling in the night.zts17807e	I feel like a nine-tailed fox creature is chasing me, wanting to take my liver.zts17808e	I'm very afraid. I only need hear the word 'fox' and I get goosebumps. I simply can't...zts17809e	What? Foxes are a piece of cake? Then prove it!zts17810e	Okay, I'll hunt them down.zts17811e	Many years after my sister was born...zts17812e	...all of our animals were killed in a single night. And every one of them was missing its liver.zts17813e	I... I can't say any more than that. I know absolutely nothing!zts17814e	If you really want to know the truth, then visit my younger brother. He's as honest as a church mouse...zts17815e	Okay, I'll go and meet him.zts17816e	I said I don't know anything!zts17817e	Mr Park's Third Sonzts17818e	Have you heard anything about the beast? About my sister? Maybe from my brother?zts17819e	I've seen it. I've seen it all. A nine-tailed fox creature that stole the livers of all the animals... my sister Foxy's creepy behaviour!zts17820e	But my parents didn't believe a word I said. They threw me out because they thought I was merely badmouthing my sister.zts17821e	A long time has passed since then. I'm now on my way back home to reveal the truth at last.zts17822e	But unfortunately I've lost the special flasks my wife prepared for me for the journey.zts17823e	They're extremely important to me. Could you help me find them?zts17824e	Lost Preparationszts17825e	By the way... what did you say these flasks were for?zts17826e	Thank you. I can sense a mysterious energy coming from the contents of these flasks. Where are they from, again?zts17827e	What's in the Red Flask?zts17828e	My village was completely devastated by Foxy.zts17829e	I need to tell the people about my sister's true face. That way I'll be able to save my parents and neighbours.zts17830e	As far as I know, Foxy is extremely susceptible to the contents of the Red Flask. It doesn't do very much damage, but it's still very effective.zts17831e	Would you try to force that red stuff on her?zts17832e	Okay, I'll try.zts17833e	Mother, father... please forgive your disobedient child.zts17834e	Thank you so much. Now my parents and all of our neighbours will be able to live in peace at last.zts17835e	I simply can't sleep.zts17836e	You're unbelievable!zts17837e	Winter Event: Sun and Moonzts17838e	Searching for the Siblings' Motherzts17839e	Need Sesame Oilzts17840e	Exchange Brass Coinzts17841e	The kind-hearted siblings were waiting for their mother who had gone to work.zts17842e	I hear their father left them when they were young, so they only had their mother to rely on, who cared and looked after them.zts17843e	But today there hasn't been any sign of her.zts17844e	They've just learned that the Millennial Tiger has been spotted on the village outskirts. They're very worried.zts17845e	I think you should be able to find out what's happened if you find the tiger. Do you want to try?zts17846e	Yes, I'll try.zts17847e	I actually wanted to eat some rice and stir-fried vegetables. But someone's stolen my sesame oil!zts17848e	Stir-fried vegetables and rice without sesame oil? Not on your life!zts17849e	I need to prepare the other ingredients. Could you help me?zts17850e	You can get sesame oil by hunting monsters.zts17851e	Oh, and the tiger keeps making an appearance. If you're carrying enough sesame oil, use it on him. You'll be amazed at what happens.zts17852e	Okay, understood. I'll bring you some Sesame Oil.zts17853e	Give me three Brass Coins and I'll give you this chest.zts17854e	Please exchange them.zts17855e	I hope their mother is safe...zts17856e	She'll be fine!zts17857e	Aaah... You're looking for the siblings' mother, right?zts17858e	That rice cake was delicious! Such a shame I won't be able to treat myself to it again. *snigger*zts17859e	I know all about the lady, but I'm not going to tell just anybody.zts17860e	Bring me some Bean Flour Cakes and Red Bean Rice Cakes! Then I'll spill the beans! *snigger*zts17861e	He likes Bean Flour Cakes and Red Bean Rice Cakes?zts17862e	Where can I find them?zts17863e	You'll find Bean Flour Cakes in the food shop, and Red Bean Rice Cakes can be earned through hunting. *snigger*zts17864e	Oh, you've got the rice cakes with you. They look as tasty as the ones the woman used to make. *snigger*zts17865e	Now stop worrying about them and be off with you!zts17866e	I'll meet up with the youngsters and tell them what happened to their mother. *snigger*zts17867e	That's not what we agreed!zts17868e	(There's something odd about this tiger. I'll tell the Wanderer about it.)zts17869e	Meet the Wandererzts17870e	Have you found out anything about the mother?zts17871e	Is that true? The tiger knows something about her?zts17872e	I've heard the tiger's been seen wearing her clothes. Maybe... could she have been killed?zts17873e	And the tiger's trying to trick the siblings so it can eat them too! Wait a minute... wasn't that two different stories? One with some children in the forest, another with a wolf??zts17874e	Whatever. There's no proof.zts17875e	You should go to the siblings' house. If the tiger's threatening them, deal with it and save their skins.zts17876e	I hope the siblings are still alive...zts17877e	Maybe they've lost both of their parents now... the poor things.zts17878e	They'll survive... don't you worry about it!zts17879e	Thanks. I have faith in you. And I'll look after them.zts17880e	That's very compassionate.zts17881e	Oh! You're a speedy one! I'll give you the seal so you can confront the tiger.zts17882e	Give me rice cakes! Or I'll eat you! *ROAR!*zts17893e	Easter Event: Hungbu and Nolbuzts17894e	My younger brother Hungbu suddenly became stinking rich. In a single day...zts17895e	I never was able to find out how he'd managed it. But I really want to know!zts17896e	In fact, I wanted to ask him myself. But I severed all contact with him after running off with our parents' legacy.zts17897e	Adventurer, do you think you could find out for me? I know, I know... I'm asking a lot of you.zts17898e	Before we stopped talking to one another, I threw him out when all he wanted was something to eat. Was I too hard on him?zts17899e	Why did you...?zts17900e	Aah, so you're interested in knowing how I became so rich? You wouldn't believe me anyway.zts17901e	Back then, in spring, a family of swallows came and built their nest under our roof. One of the chicks fell out of the nest and broke its leg.zts17902e	It was such a sorry sight. Yet we were so poor that we didn't even have anything to feed it, and that poor injured swallow had to suffer for it.zts17903e	Nevertheless, I put effort into looking after the little fellow for many days, and in the end it made a full recovery.zts17904e	A few days later, the swallows brought me a few gourd seeds, which I planted in front of the house. Miraculously, the gourd grew to full ripeness in a single day.zts17905e	Since my family was very near starvation, I decided to cook it straight away. Yet when I cut into it, nothing but jewels and pieces of gold fell out.zts17906e	And so I became the rich man you see before you. Hehe.zts17907e	As I expected... difficult to believe huh? Well, I have here the very last seed from that first gourd. Do you want to try it out?zts17908e	You'll be surprised when you plant it. Hehe.zts17909e	(Looks like he's telling the truth. Still, I'd rather not tell Nolbu... though I've already promised to help him. Hmm... guess I have no other choice...)zts17910e	Well, adventurer, you're late! The rumours about Hungbu have already done the rounds in town.zts17911e	So I broke the swallow's leg and then made sure it healed again. And see, I've got a seed as well! Haha!zts17912e	I've just planted it in front of the house. Soon I'll be a millionaire! Muhahaha!zts17913e	Well, you may have taken your time about it, but you still helped me. Here, you can have this seed rather than a normal reward.zts17914e	Although... perhaps a whole seed is a bit too much of a good thing... here, you can have half of it.zts17915e	(There's something fishy about this seed. A monster sprang out of the gourd. I have to tell Nolbu about it.)zts17916e	Oh no! I'm completely ruined...zts17917e	The seeds the swallows brought me produced monsters. They've taken over my house.zts17918e	I've been punished heavily for my greed. I never should have broken that swallow's leg.zts17919e	Adventurer, please help me! If you drive the monsters away, I'll show you my gratitude.zts17920e	If I survive this crisis, I promise to be kinder and never to be greedy again. *sniff*zts17921e	Oh! Thank you so much!zts17922e	I shall make an example of myself and become a true role model. From now on I shall be nice and friendly.zts17923e	It's about time I went and asked Hungbu for forgiveness.zts17924e	*tweet, tweet*zts17925e	(The swallow's crying out with pain from its broken leg.)zts17926e	(I ought to see if I can heal that leg and find a cure by defeating monsters.)zts17927e	I need to heal it as quickly as possible.zts17928e	I should ignore him.zts17929e	(I don't understand why, but I seem to have earned his appreciation.)zts17930e	Hungbu Became Richzts17931e	Be Nice and Friendlyzts17932e	Injured Swallowzts17934e	Bewitched Soldierszts17935e	Cleanse the Power of Evilzts17936e	Collect Seeds of Damnationzts17937e	For the Realm of Heroeszts17938e	Heroes of the Pastzts17939e	I heard that the Mysterious Traveller and an Unknown Woman have been found in the Region of the Burning Sword.zts17940e	I'm not psychic, so I can't tell what they're dreaming up, but I'm certain their dream isn't pure...zts17941e	Do you think it'd be possible for you to find out what they're plotting and stop them?zts17942e	I will try.zts17943e	Uhh, I'm too busy...zts17944e	Do you need more Cleansing Powder?zts17945e	Please bring me three Soul Slivers and I'll make you three lots of Cleansing Powder.zts17946e	Here are the Soul Slivers.zts17947e	I can create two of Witch Laurena's Raid Seals for you if you bring me five Seeds of Damnation. You can collect them in the Cave of Ghosts.zts17948e	Here are the Seeds of Damnation.zts17949e	Heaven's great heroes did their best to defeat this beast.zts17950e	Now the heroes have been weakened, they're searching for the Soul of Heaven.zts17951e	Give me Caligor's Spirit and you'll get gemstones of completion.zts17952e	Light Specialists - Questzts17953e	I've discovered their last traces at the Volcano Gate.zts17954e	The Mysterious Traveller again... what's his plan? What's he plotting this time?zts17955e	The Volcano Gate...zts17956e	Here's where their trail leads... just what were they doing here?zts17957e	(Using the power of the Time-Space and a journey into the past, you attempt to find out what happened.)zts17958e	Journey to the Pastzts17959e	Laurena, is everything alright?zts17960e	Don't worry, the world will soon be destroyed. And I've been able to find out where the heroes are hiding.zts17961e	Fantastic! Let's go and find those weakened heroes. We need them as part of our plan.zts17962e	Trust me, hehe.zts17963e	........zts17964e	(Thanks to your journey into the past, you were able to eavesdrop on a conversation between the Mysterious Traveller and the Unknown Woman.)zts17966e	How exactly are they connected?zts17967e	What did you just say?!zts17968e	Oh no, there's no time to waste. Quickly, you need to go to the Maple Woods' Edge where the heroes now live. Hurry!zts17969e	I've heard this is where the heroes live. Where are they?zts17970e	(I have to find them quickly, before we all wind up in big trouble.)zts17971e	Who... who are you?zts17972e	(You ask him what happened.)zts17973e	We are the disciples, the Guardians of Light. We were busy treating the wounds which we suffered during the fight against Laurena's Beast.zts17974e	Then suddenly we were attacked by a man, a witch and their creatures. We were strong...zts17975e	But not strong enough. We were wounded and our comrades began to fall, one after the other... even I was badly injured by the beasts.zts17976e	I managed to remain conscious and was able to hide.zts17977e	The last thing I saw was the witch casting her evil spells over my comrades to weaken them.zts17978e	She was using the power of damnation to its utmost.zts17979e	One after another they began to fall... and transform into monstrosities.zts17980e	But they are Guardians of Light. Even after their transformation, their souls were still strong and they tried to break the witch's curse.zts17981e	The man and the witch sent them into the Time-Space and then disappeared.zts17982e	That's all I managed to observe before I lost consciousness.zts17985e	There's still hope. We need to develop a cure so that they can regenerate before they transform completely.zts17986e	The witch's name is Laurena, also known as the White Witch. Diabolically evil.zts17987e	They're transforming...zts17988e	Transforming into something evil?zts17989e	Yes. If we leave them behind, they will be lost forever.zts17990e	I can feel their souls...zts17991e	It would be terrible if they were all transformed.zts17992e	We have to act fast, defeat Witch Laurena and reverse the transformation.zts17993e	First we need to prepare a cure. Bring me some Soul Slivers.zts17994e	You can find them in the Unknown Land. Please hurry!zts17995e	You found them! That brings us one step closer to making the cure.zts17996e	But there's something else I need. The Seeds of Damnation.zts17997e	The Seeds of Damnation?zts17998e	The witch's abode is protected by a magic field fed by dark magic.zts17999e	You'll need a raid seal to enter this place.zts18000e	The Seed of Damnation is a part of this seal. You can harvest these seeds by reaping Poison Plants of Damnation.zts18001e	Now go. We haven't much time.zts18002e	You can collect Seeds of Damnation in the Cave of Ghosts.zts18003e	Well done! Please wait a moment for Witch Laurena's Raid Seal.zts18004e	Finally! The cure and the raid seal are ready.zts18005e	It's time to put a stop to her plans and free the heroes.zts18006e	There's no time to waste. Hurry!zts18007e	Let me give you a few useful pointers before you go.zts18008e	For one thing, don't underestimate the witch's powers. And you should be at least as careful when facing Laurena's Beast.zts18009e	Laurena's Beast will be at least as powerful as the Guardians of Light once were.zts18010e	Now go, put a stop to her plans and rescue the heroes.zts18011e	Earthling, you have achieved great things.zts18012e	Witch Laurena cannot be forgiven for bewitching the heroes. She must pay for her sins.zts18013e	Please destroy Witch Laurena! For the realm of heroes!zts18014e	Heroes... I will never forget you.zts18015e	Ohh...zts18016e	(A heavily wounded person who looks like a soldier is lying on the floor.)zts18017e	Oh... I'm too late.zts18018e	Light Specialists - Raidzts18019e	Come here, Mr Beast!zts18020e	Sarakael's Suggestionzts18021e	What exactly were they on about? I need to let Sarakael know.zts18022e	(It seems they are planning some great coup. I have to tell Sarakael.)zts18023e	(You tell Sarakael everything that you learned from the Shocked Soldier.)zts18025e	Well, we can't find out who the thief was. But if we follow this bunny trail, we might be able to find out where the thief is.zts18026e	What's the connection between the thief and the bunnies?zts18027e	Huh?! But... but I need liver first.zts18028e	Okay. Where can we find the bunny tracks? Should we look around NosVille first?zts18029e	(Naughty bunny! Oh well, at least I can live a life of luxury once we've found the treasure. Haha!)zts18030e	Hrmph. I haven't found the bunnies yet, but I have a feeling I know where they're hiding.zts18031e	Really? Where are they? I'm gonna get those little tails of theirs and... Well! Maybe we can tempt them out with carrots?zts18032e	Wait... you talk like you know these rabbits?zts18033e	No, not at all.zts18034e	Not in the slightest. Where would I get to know traitors like that? No, no. I mean, there's no way I could even meet the bunnies. After all, I live in the sea. Hehe.zts18035e	Oh really?zts18036e	Try to tempt them out first. Won't they come out of their own accord then?zts18037e	Where can I get carrots from?zts18038e	Come now, adventurer! Carrots grow in fields of course.zts18039e	Was that your attempt at humour?zts18040e	Sorry.zts18041e	(Is he taking the carrot? Pulling my parsnip? Unbelievable!)zts18042e	Wow, he's absolutely mad about carrots.zts18043e	What are you staring at? Never seen a rabbit before? Well, if not, gimme those carrots.zts18044e	(You approach and punish him gently.)zts18045e	Hey! I hear you stole all the treasure from the Ocean Palace. Where is it?zts18046e	What?! People think we're the thieves? We're innocent! The tortoise wanted to steal them first.zts18047e	(You look suspiciously at Raphael.)zts18048e	It's true! Raphael used to be one of our boss's business partners, trading seafood and ginseng leaves.zts18049e	Then one day he suggested clearing out the safe in the Ocean Palace.zts18050e	After all the treasure had been nicked, our boss attacked Raphael and the treasure came into the possession of our family business.zts18051e	(One time when I asked him about the ginseng leaves, he said they were cultivating them illegally to earn a bit of money and then disappear.)zts18052e	A carrot field? If you're lying, I'll come back here and batter you!zts18053e	Believe me, it's true.zts18054e	Alright, I'll be right back.zts18055e	Thanks. Though I'd rather never see you again... I mean, err, see you soon!zts18056e	Be gentle.zts18057e	(But the bunny has quickly bounced away.)zts18058e	(Raphael... Was he lying to me? They were working together! What should I do with the treasure... should I take it myself? Or should I bring it back to that strange tortoise?)zts18059e	Adventurer! Please bring back the Dragon King's Raid Box and the Bunny Liver.zts18060e	Give him the Bunny Liver in the form of a Ginseng Leaf and the Dragon King's Raid Box.zts18061e	Only give him the Bunny Liver in the form of a Ginseng Leaf.zts18062e	Oh, adventurer! Thank you for bringing back my most valuable possessions... I mean... my lord the Dragon King's most valuable possessions.zts18063e	And it's also the cure. Thanks again!zts18064e	(Oh, sweet fortune! I've done it! It's goodbye to my sad old life, hello to my new one.)zts18065e	Let's see now. Where's the car dealership? Yoohoo!zts18066e	Huh?!zts18067e	What? I didn't say anything. I didn't know you were still here.zts18068e	I'm really very grateful. Look, here's a little gift for you.zts18069e	What?! The treasure's gone?!zts18070e	No... no... not my treasure! I mean, my king's treasure.zts18071e	(Ouch... this is reeeeally bad.)zts18072e	What about the cure? Do you have it with you?zts18073e	(You give him the Bunny Liver in the form of a Ginseng Leaf.)zts18074e	Oh, that's great news.zts18075e	What about the rabbits? Did they get away?zts18076e	(Naughty bunny! I want revenge!)zts18077e	Thanks, adventurer. Here's a little present for you.zts18078e	I'll head over to the Ocean Palace now.zts18079e	Please help me. I need to hurry.zts18081e	Can I ask you for a favour?zts18082e	Could you bring me another cure?zts18083e	My mother is already very old.zts18084e	She's old but the cure would probably help her. Could you bring some more?zts18085e	Pretty please.zts18086e	(I've heard that Bunny Liver is something of a cure for everything... maybe I should take it too?)zts18087e	Thank you!zts18089e	Raphael's Storyzts18090e	Ginseng Diggerzts18091e	Have you got a moment?zts18092e	I need to find something as quickly as possible.zts18093e	What are you staring at? Never seen a rabbit before?zts18094e	If I ever see you again, I'll give you a thumping!zts18095e	That's...?zts18096e	A curious rabbit burrow... maybe the bunnies are inside.zts18097e	I ought to tell Raphael.zts18098e	(A very busy bunny appears.)zts18099e	(I tempted it with a carrot and it came straight towards me.)zts18100e	You belong to Lola's bunny family, right?zts18101e	Who are you? A disgrace to our boss!!zts18102e	This is the story of Lola's bunny family. We're the ones who carry out a healthy trade to...zts18103e	(After shouting at him, all was quiet.)zts18104e	Do I need to give you all a clip around the ear to learn anything? Where's your hiding place? Lola Lopears? Is Lola Lopears your boss?zts18105e	Maybe our boss is currently out collecting Ginseng Leaves.zts18106e	You can reach our hiding place via NosVille. You'll need that to get inside.zts18107e	A very curious-looking rabbit burrow...zts18108e	Ah yes, that's true. I forgot to tell you about that.zts18109e	Bunnies are so fast. They'll quickly run away if you aren't paying attention to them.zts18110e	Come out, come out! You've got five seconds, or else...zts18111e	One...zts18112e	Two...zts18113e	I'll tell you everything! Please, just let me go. The hiding place? It's...zts18114e	Oh, I can't...zts18115e	(I'll give his ears a tug, then he'll spill the beans.)zts18116e	The hiding place has changed places. Only Lola's Master Bunnies know where it is.zts18117e	If you're lucky, you'll find one around the carrot field.zts18118e	Please don't squeal on me that I told you everything. My family's waiting!zts18119e	Thanks. But let me tell you my story first.zts18120e	I'm the tortoise Raphael, a loyal servant of the Dragon King who rules over the ocean.zts18121e	One day some thief came and stole all the treasure from the Ocean Palace. When he found out, the Dragon King had a breakdown.zts18122e	The doctor says normal treatment won't cure him. But treating him with Bunny Liver would help.zts18123e	That's the reason I left the Ocean Palace behind and came onto dry land, to find that robbing rabbit and the cure.zts18124e	There's just one hitch. I found the thief, but she was too darned quick. As you probably know, I'm a little on the slow side and didn't have a hope of catching her.zts18125e	Please find Bunny Livers and the treasure for my Dragon King.zts18126e	I implore you.zts18127e	My lord the Dragon King is in a critical condition, so please deal with the Bunny Livers first.zts18128e	As I said, that's the cure.zts18129e	Wait... you talk as if you know these bunnies?zts18130e	Oh, adventurer! Thank you for bringing back my most valuable possessions... I mean... my lord the Dragon King's most valuable possessions.zts18131e	(You hand over the empty box, very carefully.)zts18132e	Is this some kind of joke?zts18133e	I'd bet my shell this box is empty!zts18134e	(Is running away quickly an option?)zts18135e	(The timid bunny has reappeared.)zts18136e	Reputation Shopzts18137e	Welcome!zts18138e	You can purchase equipment with your reputation.zts18139e	Look here.zts18140e	Oh, and do you know anything about the four forgotten heroes?zts18141e	Once upon a time there were four heroes. They ascended to the celestial plane and discovered a great power. Afterwards they returned to NosVille, to educate the people in how to use this power.zts18142e	They prompted the people to learn magic. This also had a major impact on their existence, improving their quality of life.zts18143e	The magic they use is a part of them. They allow you to use the strength of the specialists.zts18144e	The celestial plane... one day, I too will explore it.zts18145e	Glacernon once belonged to the celestial plane... but nobody would believe it.zts18146e	I found their equipment in Glacernon. That's how I discovered everything.zts18147e	These four heroes!zts18171e	Happy New Year! Have you got plans for the New Year?zts18172e	Act 6 - Graham (NosVille)zts18173e	Great Holy Stonezts18174e	Hello! We finally meet at last. My name's Graham.zts18175e	I descended from the Forgotten Archipelago in the heavens. Ancelloan gave me the task of watching over you.zts18176e	Now I need your help. Can I count on you?zts18177e	Sure, I'll help.zts18178e	Sorry, I'm busy.zts18179e	I will be eternally grateful. Once you're prepared, you can travel to the Forgotten Archipelago whenever you like.zts18180e	Do you want to journey to the Forgotten Archipelago now?zts18181e	To the Forgotten Archipelagozts18182e	Thanks, adventurer. You've made the right decision.zts18183e	Let's head over to the Forgotten Archipelago now. I'll fill you in on the details later.zts18184e	Act 6 - Grahamzts18185e	Welcome to the very first continent. I serve Ancelloan, the goddess who created this world.zts18186e	Before she disappeared, Ancelloan anointed a successor. That disciple was the first crusader. And so it continued, passing down through the generations. I'm the 903rd crusader.zts18187e	The Forgotten Archipelago!zts18188e	NosVille and Glacernon were once part of this Forgotten Archipelago.zts18189e	But that was before the war between angels and demons caused these lands to fall.zts18190e	Some people call the Forgotten Archipelago 'Mystic Heaven'. Others think of it as 'Hellord'. Well, they're half right.zts18191e	Mystic Heaven and Hellord both belong to the Forgotten Archipelago. It was once a mighty continent. But that time has passed...zts18192e	Once cut off from the great continent by their actions, the angels and demons no longer had full command of their powers. In leaving their rightful place, their powers were weakened.zts18193e	So they searched for their representatives on Glacernon.zts18194e	And they kept fighting, driving back rival adventurers.zts18195e	(You keep listening.)zts18196e	This protracted battle had a major impact on NosVille.zts18197e	The demon king, the unshackling of the Fernon tree, the summoning of chaos, the resurrection of the angel king, the appearance of the sun god... you see, it continues to have an impact.zts18198e	But in all of these battles, there was a creature involved which nobody had expected.zts18199e	What creature?zts18200e	You! You have the power! You're the one carrying Ancelloan's legacy.zts18201e	You are part of Ancelloan's plan.zts18202e	You and you alone can end this quarrel between the angel and demons.zts18203e	Please. Put an end to it.zts18204e	But first, take a look around. Meet the angels and demons.zts18205e	Act 6 - Panuelzts18206e	Where can I find them?zts18207e	You can find them in every camp, standing at the corner of the road.zts18208e	A human? How did a human get here? You must be one of the demons' spies! Very dubious!zts18209e	(You are kicked out.)zts18210e	Act 6 - Eligoszts18211e	I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Let's meet the demons.zts18212e	A human? Curious... Shall we draw up a contract? You look pretty strong.zts18213e	Why are you fighting against the angels?zts18214e	Those abhorrent angels! We will not lay down our swords until they are vanquished!zts18215e	Let's tell Graham.zts18216e	You're back. How did it go?zts18217e	(You tell him everything.)zts18218e	Hmm, just as I feared. This won't be easy to solve.zts18219e	Well, there's nothing else for it. You'll have to get their leaders to sign a peace treaty. Do you think you could persuade them?zts18220e	Zenas, representative of the Sun God, attends to the angels.zts18221e	Erenia, representative of the Moon God, attends to the demons.zts18222e	You should probably meet her forces first, before you face Zenas and Erenia.zts18223e	Good luck.zts18224e	Act 6 - Asahelzts18225e	A human? How did a human get here?zts18226e	You're spying for the demons. You can't see this place, get out of here!zts18227e	Let me pass, I have to speak with Goddess Zenas.zts18228e	Humans aren't allowed to see the goddess. She hasn't left her place of respite in time immemorial.zts18229e	Woe betide you should be the one to disturb her peace.zts18230e	(You explain the full story.)zts18231e	If you first grant me a little service, I'll reveal how you can meet our goddess.zts18232e	My companions were sent to the most dangerous place in Hellord. But I haven't heard anything more from them since. Please, go and see if you can find any trace of them.zts18233e	(There are clear signs of a fight, but I can't see anyone.)zts18234e	They were all destroyed?zts18235e	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Vengeance for blood.zts18236e	I will avenge them in the same way. Can you assist me?zts18237e	(I hope it's enough to console their souls.)zts18238e	Thanks. Go and meet Ramiel at Hell's Gate 2 to learn how you can meet our goddess.zts18239e	Act 6 - Ramielzts18240e	I've heard about you! Rozhanik said you were one of a kind.zts18241e	So, you desperately want to see our goddess?zts18242e	I will test your worthiness.zts18243e	If you defeat the Hellord breed of Bacooms, I'll let you in on how you must proceed.zts18244e	The fight will be easier now that Goddess Zenas remains in the Sun God's lower plain.zts18245e	Okay. The fight really is a lot easier with Bacoom Horns and Tails...zts18246e	Act 6 - Zaqielzts18247e	The human is here! Very impressive!zts18248e	You! So you're the one who wants to meet Goddess Zenas, am I right?zts18249e	Well, I've just started a new project, but I don't have sufficient materials. If you gather them for me, I'll give you a chance to meet our goddess.zts18250e	Wow... interesting. The project can finally continue.zts18251e	I'll tell you how you can meet Goddess Zenas.zts18252e	If you go to the plains of the Sun God, you'll find a statue of Zenas. There you'll see a portal which will take you to our goddess.zts18253e	But you'll first need to request an audience with Goddess Zenas. Here, take this.zts18254e	(I ought to talk to Graham.)zts18255e	Very impressive! You truly are Ancelloan's disciple, just as I thought!zts18256e	The first gate lies directly before us.zts18257e	You have an audience with Zenas. Head to the lower plain of the Sun God and reach the first goal.zts18258e	I hope you are successful.zts18259e	Goddess Zenas is rather eccentric, so please be careful.zts18260e	Bah, it's really tough. I'll have to tell Graham.zts18261e	Why are they still fighting? Is someone secretly directing events from the shadows?zts18262e	You managed to persuade Goddess Zenas! Now you can put an end to this conflict if you can convince Erenia as well.zts18263e	A little more jubilation wouldn't go amiss!zts18264e	Maybe the demons are prouder than the angels. People say it is easier to convince them with brawn than brains.zts18265e	Please do me a favour.zts18266e	You need to find Erenia's troops first.zts18267e	Act 6 - Barakzts18268e	Hmm... where will I find them?zts18269e	It's possible they've infiltrated every area of operations.zts18270e	A human? How did a human get here?zts18271e	Whatever the case may be, you've shown a great deal of fighting spirit.zts18272e	It's a long time since I last saw someone of your nature. How can I help you?zts18273e	That's nothing to do with me.zts18274e	Incidentally, the wound from the battle has not healed yet.zts18275e	I need to let this wound heal, but it's taking a long time. I don't have enough dark energy.zts18276e	Recently I saw a few youngsters slopping around some energy. It looked very much like dark energy.zts18277e	If you could defeat them and collect the energy, I'll reveal to you how you can meet our Goddess Erenia.zts18278e	Angels and dark energy... a curious mix, don't you think? Thanks, anyway.zts18279e	Act 6 - Zeparzts18280e	You've become the talk of the town around the Forgotten Archipelago. Haha.zts18281e	I'm learning a new skill, but it has a special prerequisite. The Soul of Innocence.zts18282e	The Soul of Innocence?zts18283e	Yes, the soul of the angels. If you could collect it, I'll explain how you can reach Goddess Erenia.zts18284e	No, not more war...zts18285e	Really? Then I have no other choice.zts18286e	Ouch!zts18287e	Thank you. I will use it wisely.zts18288e	Act 6 - Polneuszts18289e	Lookie here, a human.zts18290e	Well, if you're here, that means you were strong enough to get this far. But are you also intelligent enough?zts18291e	Oooh! I love a challenge! Let me propose a bet. But before you say anything, I should remind you that declining will result in your death.zts18292e	Shall we begin?zts18293e	Powerful demons carry their energy within their bodies. When they become stronger, this energy transforms into crystals. We call these crystals Dark Energy Stones.zts18294e	It's possible that angels are similar to the demons. But it's exceedingly difficult to observe them in the midst of battle.zts18295e	So here's the deal. Fight against the angels and then report back to me with your observations. Afterwards, I'll reveal the final step to you.zts18296e	(You give an account of the battle.)zts18297e	Alright, that's enough. The theory is vindicated. Now for the final step.zts18298e	We've finally reached the end. We can put an end to this eternal strife, just as soon as you manage to convince Goddess Erenia.zts18299e	Please persuade her. Erenia, Zenas' twin, is something of a specialist when it comes to leading her enemies into temptation. Be on your guard.zts18300e	Here's to your success.zts18301e	Wow, I think it's over! I have to tell Graham.zts18302e	(All dead... sadly, just as I feared. Our revenge is guaranteed!)zts18303e	Can you do me a favour? Please, annihilate the demons!zts18304e	Goddess Zenas dwells in the lower plain of the Sun God.zts18305e	You'll get more information from Zaqiel. He has infiltrated Hell's Gate 3.zts18306e	Recently a number of angels have attempt to infiltrate our space. We executed them all, naturally.zts18307e	We've decided to avenge ourselves in the same way as they did to us. That's why I'm here.zts18308e	But unfortunately we're outnumbered. Sweet angels.zts18309e	Argh, they drive me insane. Eliminate some angels, then come back here and we will talk again.zts18310e	Bah, angels aren't exactly easy either...zts18311e	Head over to Heaven's Gate 2. Zepar will meet you there.zts18312e	Find Polneus by Heaven's Gate 3.zts18313e	Did you find anything once you'd defeated the angels? You did?! Please bring it to me.zts18314e	So this is the angels' energy... interesting. It flows like blood. I need to investigate.zts18315e	Keep your promise!zts18316e	Go to the plains of the Moon God. The portal can be found next the statue of Goddess Erenia. It will transport you to Erenia's dwelling place.zts18317e	You need to take this with you in order to face her.zts18318e	(I ought to return to Graham.)zts18319e	The strife is finally over!zts18320e	Peace will reign in the Forgotten Archipelago once more. And it's all thanks to you!zts18321e	Now, you have one final task. You need to find the masterminds behind all these machinations.zts18322e	Many moons ago, I followed their tracks.zts18323e	And I believe I'll soon be able to discover who it is.zts18324e	Your adventure was taxing. I suggest you take a break before continuing. I'll let you know when I've found out more.zts18325e	A wearisome journey awaits me...zts18326e	(It isn't time for this yet. I need to find out how to reach their position.)zts18327e	Act 6 - Graham (Cylloan)zts18328e	To NosVillezts18329e	Welcome to Cylloan.zts18330e	Cylloan, world of the gods, was completely transformed after the battle. We were sent to put an end to this conflict.zts18331e	Act 6 - Supplier (Cylloan)zts18332e	Act 6 - Transformer (Cylloan)zts18333e	Demons... which we simply cannot recognise.zts18334e	Our fight will not end until we have banished every last angel from this place!zts18335e	A human here... how surprising.zts18336e	Who are you? State your name!zts18337e	Boring demons...zts18338e	How can I provoke these angels?zts18339e	Why won't you face me? You coward!zts18340e	If we defeat Zenas, this land will be ours! Hurray!zts18341e	*uff* Demons are so strong...zts18342e	Haha! I like your style!zts18343e	Can I end this conflict? Is there someone behind all this?zts18344e	(Can't he just tell me?)zts18345e	Entrance to Zenaszts18346e	'You fool! How dare you enter this place!'zts18347e	Zenas Mission Successfulzts18348e	'Ancelloan's protection? Who are you?'zts18349e	Zenas Mission Failedzts18350e	'Haha! You're as weak as I thought you would be.'zts18351e	Entrance to Ereniazts18352e	'Well now, how did you get here? Never mind. You'll soon learn your limits.'zts18353e	Erenia Mission Successfulzts18354e	'Sigh. Vex me and you will soon meet your destiny!'zts18355e	Erenia Mission Failedzts18356e	'Huh? Your friend... don't be sad. I'll send you to him.'zts18357e	It's tough. She was so strange. Why does she love this luxury?zts18358e	That was seriously tough. She was much more raucous than I expected. Will the conflict end now?zts18359e	From now on I will be with you. May the gods bless you always!zts18360e	Unknown Crusaderzts18361e	'Ouch! It's too bright!'zts18362e	The pillar of light which sprang from the Great Holy Stone envelops your entire body.zts18363e	'The fools are all back again! I'll give you a chance to hit me. But first you must pass three tests.'zts18364e	'Ancelloan's protection? Who are you? How did you pass the tests?!'zts18365e	'Wow, how did you get here? Never mind. You'll soon know your limits. My tests are no trifling matter.'zts18366e	'Sigh. Vex me and you will soon meet your destiny! The tests seem to be too simple!'zts18369e	Stolen Goodszts18370e	The Hardest Gemstonezts18371e	Rare Gem Collectorzts18372e	Burstingzts18373e	Time-Space Explorerzts18374e	Time-Spacezts18375e	Explore the Time-Spacezts18376e	Lord of the Time-Spacezts18377e	Felice (Alchemist)zts18378e	Time-Space Researcher (1)zts18379e	Time-Space Researcher (2)zts18380e	Time-Space Researcher (3)zts18381e	Medicine Collectorzts18382e	Stypticzts18383e	Research Goalzts18384e	Crusader Captainzts18385e	Praying for the Deadzts18386e	Memories of the Deadzts18387e	The Patrol's Traceszts18388e	Purificationzts18389e	Rescue the Crusaderzts18390e	Go to Ancelloanzts18391e	Captain (Cylloan)zts18392e	Board Airshipzts18393e	Prepare Yourselfzts18394e	The storm is coming... again. *cluck* But we'll still fly. *cluck*zts18395e	After all... *cluck* we've got jet engines. *cluck* Right?zts18396e	Legendary Hunterzts18397e	Vanquishing Kertoszts18398e	Vanquishing Valakuszts18399e	Vanquishing Grenigaszts18400e	Vanquishing Lord Dracozts18401e	Vanquishing Glaceruszts18402e	Vanquishing Witch Laurenazts18403e	Astarothzts18404e	Defeat Guardians!zts18405e	Defeat Rozhanik!zts18406e	Defeat Esther!zts18407e	Defeat Lazekiel!zts18408e	Defeat Mysticaron!zts18409e	Defeat Zealots!zts18410e	Kirelzts18411e	Defeat Ghastly Spearmen!zts18412e	Defeat Tallion!zts18413e	Defeat Rement!zts18414e	Defeat Ismatte!zts18415e	Defeat Bacooms!zts18416e	Libelzts18417e	Punishing Evilzts18418e	Harpagozts18419e	Punishing the Hypocriteszts18420e	Captain (Airship)zts18421e	Destinationzts18422e	Jet engines! *cluck* Jet engines! *cluck* *cluck*zts18423e	Go to Ancelloan's Willzts18424e	Captain (Airship - Ancelloan)zts18425e	Let's turn around, *cluck*. The storm... *cluck* It's getting... *cluck* closer again.zts18426e	Go to Cylloanzts18427e	Missing Scoutzts18428e	Where has Eldinen gone? Has he really set off to explore Hellord?zts18429e	Calm down!zts18430e	I'm worried about Kerzena in Mystic Heaven.zts18431e	Hysteriazts18432e	Grahamzts18433e	We regularly send out patrols to keep a watch on their movements. We've also managed to expand the range of our search and explore the Forgotten Archipelago.zts18434e	But a few months ago our scouts didn't return.zts18435e	The Crusader Captain wants to talk to you about the missing patrol.zts18436e	Crusader Captainzts18437e	Greetings, adventurer!zts18438e	I understand that Graham has already briefed you about our problem, so you're already up to speed.zts18439e	Really it's a problem of our order, but we're fairly short of manpower at the moment as we're trying to stop the conflict between the angels and demons.zts18440e	Do you think you could look for the missing patrol for us? I beg you.zts18441e	The patrol was sent to Ancelloan's Will.zts18442e	You can only get there by airship. Use the one behind me.zts18443e	I will inform the captain.zts18444e	Airship Captainzts18445e	Welcome *cluck* aboard! *cluck*zts18446e	I'm the captain of this airship, *cluck*. Just call me 'Captain'. *cluck*zts18447e	Wow...zts18448e	(Captain Pete O'Peng is captain of this airship!)zts18449e	*cluck*? Is this your first time on an airship? *cluck*zts18450e	This airship is unique. *cluck* *blah, blah* Isn't it fantastic, *cluck*?zts18451e	... (What's he saying?)zts18452e	The order told me about your journey. *cluck*zts18453e	So you 're looking for the missing scouts eh? *cluck*zts18454e	No problem, I'll take you there. *cluck* But not yet. *cluck*zts18455e	We've met before. *cluck* On the last flight. In the storm. *cluck*zts18456e	Fortunately, it's no problem for me. *cluck* Because I'm so smart! *cluck*zts18457e	We made it! *cluck* But the engine has been damaged. *cluck*zts18458e	We need to repair the engine... *cluck* if we want to fly again. *cluck*zts18459e	I need some materials... *cluck* for repairing the engine. *cluck*zts18460e	Oh wonderful! *cluck*zts18461e	I didn't expect you to be so good! *cluck*zts18462e	I'll be back soon. *cluck* Just give me a minute. *cluck*zts18463e	(Let's... *cluck*... upgrade... *cluck* the engine this time *cluck*.)zts18464e	*cluck* That was tough! *cluck* But we finished it. *cluck*zts18465e	Now you need to pay for your ticket. *cluck*zts18466e	*cluck*? Upgrade... *cluck*? No, *cluck*!zts18467e	You helped repair the engine. *cluck* The order sent me a special request, *cluck*.zts18468e	I'll offer you a special offer! *cluck* 50%... *cluck* discount! *cluck*zts18469e	(What a racketeer!)zts18470e	Adventurer, *cluck*. You're very wealthy, *cluck*.zts18471e	Time to depart! *cluck*zts18472e	*cluck* We're there. Be careful! *cluck*zts18473e	It's very dangerous here... *cluck*zts18474e	Adventurerzts18475e	Hmm... evidence of a battle...zts18476e	We should follow the traces.zts18477e	(Following the path you come to a dead end.)zts18478e	Looks like something was dragged this way.zts18479e	The enemies must have dragged a body.zts18480e	Did no one survive this battle?zts18481e	(You discover a surviving crusader.)zts18482e	Hmm, strange...zts18483e	He seems to be rather dazed and tired.zts18484e	I need to get closer.zts18485e	(As you approach he suddenly attacks.)zts18486e	Looks like he's not too bad after all. But his wounds look serious!zts18487e	Save him!zts18488e	If that wound gets infected, it could turn nasty. He needs to get back to town as quickly as possible.zts18489e	The Wounded Crusaderzts18490e	(You pour Cylloan Spring Water over his wounds.)zts18491e	Oh... I... where... where am I?zts18492e	Can you hear me? You've been wounded. Try not to move!zts18493e	You were left behind. What happened?zts18494e	I... I don't know... I don't remember much. Ugh...zts18495e	I've treated your wounds, but it's only a temporary fix.zts18496e	Let's return to Cylloan and get you treated.zts18497e	I need to go back to Cylloan and report to the Crusader Captain.zts18498e	Hey, adventurer. Have you made any progress?zts18499e	(You explain what you have found out so far.)zts18500e	Wow, that's hard to believe. A crusader behaving strangely...zts18501e	For now, I think we should listen to what the crusader you saved has to say.zts18502e	It's time to finish the treatment.zts18503e	I'm so ashamed... all my comrades are dead.zts18504e	I'm the only one to survive...zts18505e	Our scout lost his way.zts18506e	But then suddenly the patrol members started acting weirdly.zts18507e	They began to attack one another!zts18508e	*cough* Argh...zts18509e	And then...zts18510e	There's so much blood on it.zts18511e	We should try to restore it.zts18512e	Felice the Alchemist will know what to do.zts18513e	Please talk to him.zts18514e	Felice (Alchemist)zts18515e	Priest, do you think you can restore this?zts18516e	Of course! Impossible isn't even in my vocabulary!zts18517e	But that doesn't mean it won't be a long and complicated endeavour. I'll need to be very meticulous.zts18518e	I'm also going to need certain materials.zts18519e	Bring me the materials I need, and I'll try to restore it for you.zts18520e	It won't be easy to get everything together.zts18521e	Right, let's get started!zts18522e	Right, it's restored now. You can take it to the Crusader Captain.zts18523e	The fearless crusaders bravely carried their faith before them even in death.zts18524e	Even if they turn into monsters, this spark of faith will burn on within them.zts18525e	If you defeat them, this spark will be rekindled for a short time, before they finally perish.zts18526e	You should have just enough time to ask them what happened.zts18527e	Even though they were turned into monsters...zts18528e	Many served Ancelloan's will and fought for the weak.zts18529e	To ensure they can rest...zts18530e	Who are you?zts18531e	(The wound looks pretty serious. He's coughing heavily.)zts18532e	*cough, cough*zts18533e	There isn't much time...zts18534e	P... please... give this to the Crusader Captain.zts18535e	What happened?zts18536e	Argh!zts18537e	You're back. Did it go well?zts18538e	I'm ashamed to be seen by my comrades.zts18539e	Rest in peace, you warriors of Ancelloan.zts18540e	The dead crusader asked me to bring you this.zts18541e	But I'm afraid I've no idea what it is.zts18542e	We need to find someone who knows something about it.zts18543e	Among the angels there is someone who knows. Please talk to him.zts18544e	He's one of the angels' most capable scouts.zts18545e	I'm sure he'll be able to help you solve this riddle.zts18546e	Eldinenzts18547e	Why are you here, human?zts18548e	Wait a minute... just what do you have there?zts18549e	I can feel it giving off a divine energy... and a sinister one...zts18550e	(You show him the strange crystal.)zts18551e	I've been travelling through this world for centuries, but it's the first time I've seen something like this. Interesting...zts18552e	I think this is the energy of the angel and demon kings.zts18553e	No... it's more like the energy of the Slade tribe.zts18554e	Do you know anything about the Slades?zts18555e	It's prohibited for humans to learn anything about them, but since you helped us.zts18556e	I will tell you about them and pay off my debt.zts18557e	Where to begin...zts18558e	According to the ancient writings, it all began when, for whatever reason, the sun god and the moon god had a quarrel.zts18559e	Their quarrel became an argument, the argument became a feud, and this molehill ended up turning into a war.zts18560e	As soon as this war started, their two followers joined in, Erenia and Zenas.zts18561e	The war simmered on for years. Eventually, Ancelloan and the Slade tribe who followed her, decided to mediate.zts18562e	The powerful Slades were able to overcome the angels and the demons.zts18563e	They then sealed the angel and devil kings away in Ancelloan's Will.zts18564e	But just how the Slade tribe became so powerful in the first place remains a mystery.zts18565e	Just like the golems.zts18566e	So it is written in the ancient literature.zts18567e	If you have chance, could you find out more about the Slades?zts18568e	Where did you get this?zts18569e	From Ancelloan's Will. A dying crusader gave it to me.zts18570e	Ancelloan's Will? Ah, the forbidden zone.zts18571e	Angels and demons alike are forbidden from entering this place.zts18572e	Since the kings of both parties are sealed up there, neither may enter it, according to the agreement.zts18573e	But what if... just what if...zts18574e	Maybe Ancelloan isn't dead after all. What if she is only sleeping in the darkness?zts18575e	Only you can help Ancelloan. Only you carry both good and evil within you.zts18576e	(You explain to the Crusader Captain everything you have learned so far.)zts18577e	Ancelloan isn't dead...zts18578e	Oh god...zts18579e	Adventurer, if you have inherited Ancelloan's Will... then there isn't any time to lose.zts18580e	Go to the forbidden zone and found out where she is.zts18581e	It is liable to be a relic from ancient times, which means you won't be able to find it using regular means.zts18582e	You must study the earth's memories to find it.zts18583e	Studying the earth's memories requires an ancient magic that has long been forgotten.zts18584e	But there is another way...zts18585e	Go to the Priest of Supply and get a special dowsing rod, made by the secret order.zts18586e	This dowsing rod, developed by the order in secret over many years, amplifies Ancelloan's remaining power.zts18587e	It will also locate the place of her strength.zts18588e	You will find something if you use that dowsing rod.zts18589e	Please rescue her from this evil.zts18590e	Fernonzts18591e	*The surroundings around you become hazy and start to change.*zts18592e	*Something suddenly falls from the sky.*zts18593e	*When the smoke clears, you notice someone lying on the ground.*zts18594e	*After a few moments, a light shines on this person and they divide into two beings.*zts18595e	*One of them glows like the early morning light; the other is as dark as the night.*zts18596e	*The dark figure gets up, staggers and stares down at the other body.*zts18597e	???: Haha... hahaha! I've finally managed it.zts18598e	???: I've been trapped in this body for far too long.zts18599e	???: Light, now I rule over the world!zts18600e	*The being referred to as Light is lying injured on the ground, and hardly has the strength to look up.*zts18601e	???: Ancelloan... what a humiliating end.zts18602e	???: Who knew the existence of the mother god could be extinguished so easily? Hahaha!zts18603e	???: I'm so giddy, hahaha...zts18604e	???: Now the world shall dance to my tune! Me, Fernon!zts18605e	???: Ancelloan is history.zts18606e	*The glowing figure gets up.*zts18607e	???: Fernon, my alter ego... you will never rule or destroy this world.zts18608e	???: Ancelloan, you may still have enough strength to materialise. But it is only a question of time before even that leaves you.zts18609e	???: You have lost all your powers. You cannot stop me!zts18610e	???: Fernon, you and I are two sides of the same coin.zts18611e	???: Have you forgotten that I control the same powers as you?zts18612e	???: I have made sure that you will never have control over your full abilities, nor use them at will.zts18613e	???: And now, with the strength remaining to me, I shall seal us both away forever.zts18614e	???: For the good of the world...zts18615e	???: Ancelloan!! Nooooo!zts18616e	???: Even now, at the very end, you are a thorn in my side! Argh!zts18617e	*After a while, Fernon disappears from Ancelloan's body.*zts18618e	Who is this Fernon anyway?zts18619e	I should meet the Blue Magicians in Glacernon.zts18620e	Aurelius Roshu, their leader, might know something about it.zts18621e	Aurelius Roshuzts18622e	Welcome! I've been expecting you.zts18623e	You knew I was coming?zts18624e	Yes. I read it in the mana.zts18625e	Many people come to visit me, but the mana went crazy at your approach.zts18626e	For only you bear Ancelloan's Will within you.zts18627e	So, now you know who Fernon is.zts18628e	...! You know about Fernon?zts18629e	We the Blue Magicians lived very secluded lives until we met you.zts18630e	We wanted to save the world. But that's not exactly true...zts18631e	You know that...zts18632e	Ancelloan sealed Fernon away with the last ebb of her power...zts18633e	I saw this memory in the Forgotten Archipelago.zts18634e	But I only saw that she disappeared.zts18635e	Only few people know the truth. Haha.zts18636e	Ancelloan took Fernon to Bitoren Tundra.zts18637e	There she created a Time-Space in which to seal herself and Fernon away.zts18638e	But the seal she created was not flawless, and the Time-Space became unstable.zts18639e	Fernon is gathering her strength.zts18640e	She's trying to absorb Ancelloan's power from within the Time-Space.zts18641e	She has created a beast to protect her until such time as she returns to her normal strength.zts18642e	That beast is Caligor, as you well know.zts18643e	No doubt you also know that Glacernon has been cursed?zts18644e	This is a place where you must fight for the light or the dark.zts18645e	And wherever there is war, there is also dark energy at play.zts18646e	Fernon's aim was to appropriate this dark energy, which is why she placed the curse on Glacernon.zts18647e	She draws energy from these battlefields to regenerate herself.zts18648e	Do you know how this Time-Space was created?zts18649e	War has its evil clutches around the Time-Space as well.zts18650e	Fernon is also using the resultant dark energy from there to strengthen herself.zts18651e	That cannot be!zts18652e	However, Ancelloan clearly knew that the seal was unstable.zts18653e	So she created a book which describes how this seal can be maintained and replenished.zts18654e	She gave this volume to the first Blue Magician.zts18655e	He was the first priest of Ancelloan.zts18656e	Following Ancelloan's revelation, he moved to Glacernon.zts18657e	He built a castle and recorded everything which happened while he was watching over the Time-Space.zts18658e	These recordings are known to us now as the Akashic Records.zts18659e	Events are running faster than we can control them, and Caligor is getting ever stronger.zts18660e	Maybe even Fernon will have fully recovered soon.zts18661e	Before that can be allowed to happen... you must destroy her.zts18662e	If she should ever manage to recover the full extent of her powers... then the world is doomed.zts18663e	The Akashic Records are protected by a powerful spell to prevent anyone from using the writings for evil ends.zts18664e	We'll need some materials to lift this spell.zts18665e	Please collect them for us.zts18666e	(You give the mage the materials.)zts18667e	Oh! You found everything!zts18668e	Unbelievable! I never for a minute thought that I would see Ertel before I die.zts18669e	There's one small problem though...zts18670e	The magic of this Ertel has been corrupted.zts18671e	Unfortunately, that means its effectiveness is greatly reduced. I'll only be able to use about 10% of it.zts18672e	You can think of it like a stone with mana flowing through it.zts18673e	We'll have to perform a cleansing ritual to extract all the power from it.zts18674e	But if I'm quite honest with you, I've never performed a ritual like this before.zts18675e	We're also going to need some special materials.zts18676e	Write this down, I'll describe them to you.zts18677e	First of all we need a Dragon Heart. This contains the blessing of mana.zts18678e	The other mana-bearing materials we need are:zts18679e	Dragon Blood, the Soul of Innocence and the Unknown Sanctuary. We'll need all of these.zts18680e	Phew... alright then. If it will help stop Fernon. For the good of the world...zts18681e	I'll get them all.zts18682e	You found everything! That can't have been easy.zts18683e	One moment, I'll purify the Ertel.zts18684e	(After mixing the materials together, he pours the strange concoction over the Ertel. It starts to give off a blue glow.)zts18685e	Phew, I was pretty nervous there. Fortunately, everything worked as expected.zts18686e	Hehe...zts18687e	What would have happened if you'd failed?zts18688e	Well... there might have been a large backdraught of mana and it would have exploded. Huh!zts18689e	?!zts18690e	Haha! We can just be happy everything worked out then.zts18691e	Right, let's use this magic to break the spell on the Akashic Records.zts18692e	(The wise mage creates a mysterious essence from the materials.)zts18693e	(As he pours the essence over the Akashic Records, they float up into the air.) A break light washes over them and you hear a voice in your head.)zts18694e	Slade Felix: I've been waiting a long time for this. We meet at last.zts18695e	Slade Felix: You have inherited Ancelloan's will.zts18696e	Slade Felix: I am Slade Felix, chief of the Slade tribe, and loyal servant of Ancelloan.zts18697e	Slade Felix: And... err... you are...zts18698e	Slade... Felix? Huh?zts18699e	Slade Felix: I expected you to be taller.zts18700e	Slade Felix: Well, that's not important now.zts18701e	Slade Felix: Let me tell you how to open and enter the Time-Space.zts18702e	Slade Felix: The powerful mage has no doubt already told you how Fernon created Caligor.zts18703e	Slade Felix: That means that Caligor and Fernon are bound to one another.zts18704e	Slade Felix: Defeat Caligor and the Time-Space will open.zts18705e	Slade Felix: Inside the Time-Space, you must use the Akashic Records to reach the location where Fernon has been sealed away.zts18706e	Slade Felix: Good luck in your quest!zts18707e	(After a few moments a bright flash of light shines from the Akashic Records before quickly fading away. The tome falls to the floor.)zts18708e	To be honest with you, I expected the first Blue Magician to appear.zts18709e	Certainly not the chief of the Slade tribe...zts18710e	Felix... Felix... hmm...zts18711e	The name is somehow familiar...zts18712e	May you be blessed by the mana on your travels. Hehe...zts18713e	Slade Felix...zts18714e	I should ask Eldinen about him.zts18715e	No! That's impossible!zts18716e	*The light and dark energies collide, causing a distortion in time and space. Fernon is sucked into this gaping vortex and disappears.*zts18717e	Did... did I win?zts18718e	*The light is transformed into the figure of a woman.*zts18719e	Ancelloan: Greetings, thou bearer of my will.zts18720e	Ancelloan: Thanks to your help, I was able to stop Fernon.zts18721e	Ancelloan: Fernon has fallen into a deep slumber, but the efforts used up a lot of my strength.zts18722e	Ancelloan: I must rest, if I am to recuperate.zts18723e	Ancelloan: I may need to sleep for some time.zts18724e	Ancelloan: May peace go with you.zts18725e	*After saying these words, Ancelloan melts away into a warm and bright light.*zts18726e	Slade Felix: I will guard and protect her energy.zts18727e	Slade Felix: And make sure no one finds it.zts18728e	The bright light dissipates.zts18729e	Slade Felix...zts18730e	Just like last time... that name is so familiar...zts18731e	(You tell Eldinen what happened.)zts18732e	How unexpected. It is truly fascinating just what potential lies in man.zts18733e	Now Ancelloan is asleep.zts18734e	You have brought peace to the world, adventurer.zts18735e	For a mere human, you have achieved great things.zts18736e	I bow before your courage and devotion.zts18737e	You will surely be remembered...zts18738e	Remembered as the saviour of the world!zts18739e	Oh, and you asked me to check on the Slade tribe?zts18740e	I met Slade Felix, chief of the Slades.zts18741e	He is guarding Ancelloan's energy.zts18742e	Some place no one will find it.zts18743e	Where no one will find it?zts18744e	Please... tell me more.zts18745e	The end and...zts18746e	(He will die if he doesn't get medical attention soon.)zts18747e	(You tell the Crusader Captain about the dead crusader.)zts18748e	Could you please eliminate the evil spirits and look for clues?zts18749e	I will research the Slade tribe in the order's library.zts18750e	That's... the crusader's...zts18751e	First, let me tell you what I have discovered.zts18752e	The Slade tribe have been involved in a number of events.zts18753e	Oh, there's one thing I haven't mentioned yet.zts18754e	This matter is strictly confidential and only a select few high-ranking members of the organisation know about it.zts18755e	So everything I tell you stays between us.zts18756e	People say that our order was founded by those who were bound to Ancelloan's will.zts18757e	But that's not entirely true.zts18758e	There was already a group prior to ours, who followed Ancelloan when she walked the earth.zts18759e	Maybe you've heard of them.zts18760e	They call themselves the Slades.zts18761e	They were created by Ancelloan and were her followers.zts18762e	They created Felix, served Ancelloan, and did her will.zts18763e	But that all changed when Ancelloan plunged into the belly of the earth.zts18764e	This forbidden zone is known as Ancelloan's Will.zts18765e	With Ancelloan gone, the Slades disappeared.zts18766e	But not without a trace. Old buildings remained behind on a forgotten island.zts18767e	Documents and stone tablets retrieved there proved their existence.zts18768e	We have been studying the legacy of the Slades for many years, but we've had great difficulties translating their language.zts18769e	Nevertheless, we managed to glean some very interesting facts from the evidence.zts18770e	This race of creatures were not humans, but immortal golems.zts18771e	They possessed very similar powers to the angels and demons.zts18772e	Of course, not all the Slades were strong.zts18773e	If they had been, the great war would never have occurred.zts18774e	Some of the Slade warriors were chosen by Ancelloan.zts18775e	This happened during a special ceremony, using their great powers to show their potential.zts18776e	Sadly, this ceremony has been forgotten to history.zts18777e	We're currently trying to find out more about it.zts18778e	Anyway, the order are carrying this legacy and trying to investigate the forbidden zone of the Slades at the same time.zts18779e	Our investigations have been fairly sluggish.zts18780e	Everything was fairly routine for us, but then this happened...zts18781e	It is almost certainly related to this ancient dispute you settled.zts18782e	Maybe the force which was driving this dispute has disappeared.zts18783e	We owe it to the dead to discover what that force was.zts18784e	But first I need to ask you a favour.zts18785e	Could you put those crusaders who have turned into evil spirits out of their misery, and allow them to return to Ancelloan?zts18786e	(You look at the Crusader Captain for a while and then nod solemnly.)zts18787e	(They should be allowed to find peace at Ancelloan's side.)zts18788e	When I met the Slade tribe...zts18789e	... an ancient demon appeared to me.zts18790e	Maybe he knows something.zts18791e	Kerzenazts18792e	Divine powers and dark energy coexisting on the same plane? Who'd have expected that?zts18793e	(As she uses the dark energy to calm it, it suddenly reacts.)zts18794e	This is truly pure dark energy. But how can it exist alongside divine power?zts18795e	The two would normally repel one another. And that goes double for the divine energy of the King of Angels... the purest of divine powers.zts18796e	Where did you get it, young one?zts18797e	I defeated the evil spirits in the forbidden zone. They left this behind them.zts18798e	The forbidden zone? Haha, you're always up to mischief.zts18799e	I must say I'm a little jealous...zts18800e	Unfortunately, I've never seen it before.zts18801e	Maybe the other demons know more about it.zts18802e	I'll have to do my own research first. Can you let me know if you find any more clues?zts18803e	I've heard the priests are using some rather unusual tools. What did they call them again... dowsing rods?zts18804e	Why don't you try it with them?zts18805e	While Kerzena is carrying out her investigations, I should explore the forbidden zone again.zts18806e	Maybe I missed something...zts18807e	Well, I'm sure I'm seen everything.zts18808e	I might as well try it with the Dowsing Rod.zts18809e	(The surroundings around you become hazy and start to change. After the smoke settles, someone falls into a huge crack.)zts18810e	(After a few moments, a light shines on this person and they divide into two beings. One of them glows like the early morning light; the other is as dark as the night)zts18811e	*The dark figure gets up, staggers and stares down at the other body.*zts18812e	Haha... hahaha! I've finally managed it. I've been trapped in this body for far too long.zts18813e	Light, now I rule over the world!zts18814e	Ancelloan... what a humiliating end. Who knew the existence of the mother god could be extinguished so easily? Hahaha!zts18815e	I'm so giddy, hahaha!zts18816e	Finally...zts18817e	Now the world shall dance to my tune! Me, Fernon!zts18818e	Ancelloan is history.zts18819e	(At that moment, a bright light appears from Fernon's body.)zts18820e	Fernon, my alter ego... you will never rule or destroy this world.zts18821e	Ancelloan, you may still have enough strength to materialise.zts18822e	But it is only a question of time before even that leaves you. You have lost all your powers. You cannot stop me!zts18823e	Fernon, you and I are two sides of the same coin. Have you forgotten that I control the same powers as you?zts18824e	I have made sure that you will never have control over your full abilities, nor use them at will.zts18825e	And now, with the strength remaining to me, I shall seal us both away forever.zts18826e	For the good of the world...zts18827e	Ancelloan!! Nooooo! Even now, at the very end, you are a thorn in my side! Argh!zts18828e	(After a while, Fernon disappears from Ancelloan's body.)zts18829e	The earth mother has sacrificed her life for her children.zts18830e	But why has Fernon not disappeared?zts18831e	(Suddenly, Ancelloan's ring glows in a bright light and points to the direction like a compass.)zts18832e	Should I... follow the light?zts18833e	It's pointing towards Glacernon... Then Fernon must be in Glacernon!zts18834e	Okay, first back to Kerzena, maybe she has managed to find out something. Then it's off to Glacernon.zts18835e	Kerzena, have you managed to find out anything?zts18836e	Ah, there you are. Yes, I've learned something very interesting indeed.zts18837e	It was made using the souls of the Slade.zts18838e	But didn't the Slade tribe disappear a long, long time ago?zts18839e	Hehe, yes, everyone knows that.zts18840e	The Slade tribe was created by Ancelloan to serve her.zts18841e	But what happens when the creator suddenly disappears?zts18842e	There was great confusion, and the tribe's leader didn't know what to do.zts18843e	They had lost the basis for their very existence.zts18844e	Their creator had disappeared and their powers began to wane.zts18845e	They changed and turned into simple golems.zts18846e	Well, first of all, I need a powerful mana medium.zts18847e	Ah! I would need a gemstone from Laurena and...zts18848e	I also need a soothing soul as well. The best thing would be a Shining Blue Soul.zts18849e	Oh, and a Soul of Innocence! Let's talk again when you have them. Hehehe!zts18850e	Go get them! It's my skin if you don't!zts18851e	Here. For your skin...zts18852e	(Kerzena stares at you.)zts18853e	The skin of a woman is a very important property that cannot be replaced by anything!zts18854e	However...zts18855e	Not all of the Slade tribe simply swallowed their fate and sat down to wait for death.zts18856e	Some of them sided with us demons and used our energy, strength and knowledge to transform their bodies.zts18857e	Thus a new race was born.zts18858e	We call them the Shadow Slades. Some of them are very powerful warriors and priests.zts18859e	Laurena, who you defeated, worked for the Shadow Slade priests.zts18860e	Even though they were full of energy in life, they were completely shocked when their goddess disappeared.zts18861e	They lost their impetus and remained in Hellord.zts18862e	Demons may be a simple folk, but they despise cowardice, always making fun of those who betray their own people.zts18863e	The Shadow Slades would like to get away from Hellord and escape this mockery and persecution.zts18864e	They wanted to move to NosVille.zts18865e	The humans who were attacked by those who fell soon lost all hope. The war looked like it was lost.zts18866e	But... the strength of humans is truly amazing.zts18867e	They united their forces under the banner of a group of courageous warriors.zts18868e	This rekindled their will to fight and they fought on bravely.zts18869e	Soon the tables were turned. The humans fought night and day against the Shadow Slades and were ultimately victorious.zts18870e	The warriors sealed the Shadow Slades all over NosVille, and then disappeared.zts18871e	That happened many years ago and the humans have long since forgotten. But not us.zts18872e	They were powerful and honourable opponents. But we do not know their real names.zts18873e	They called one another D, J, S and M.zts18874e	We call them the forgotten warriors. If you want to find the Shadow Slades, you will have to follow the clues to the forgotten warriors.zts18875e	Bring me Caligor's Spirit.zts18876e	Mmmmm! I love cocoa!zts18877e	Right then, let's talk about it.zts18878e	What do you think about this crystal? The one made with the souls of Shadow Slades?zts18879e	Well...zts18880e	What's the matter? Is your head just a hat stand?zts18881e	Excluding the Shadow Slades who had been sealed away, this entire tribe disappeared so suddenly from Hellord.zts18882e	And whoever it was who stole their souls also turned the humans evil.zts18883e	Who can be responsible for all that?zts18884e	It must be Fernon, Ancelloan's other incarnation.zts18885e	The Slades will not follow anyone except their creator.zts18886e	Well, now that you know who's behind it all, you know what you to do right?zts18887e	You must stop Fernon. We cannot let the world fall.zts18888e	When you have beaten her, bring me some of her energy.zts18889e	Huh? How can you kill a goddess? And how am I supposed to bring you her energy?zts18890e	There is a way.zts18891e	Hmm... alright, fine. But what do you need her energy for?zts18892e	With her energy I will be able to become an archdemon... in the name of the sealed ones!zts18893e	Given the nature of demons, Hellord is in a catastrophic condition.zts18894e	They are very aggressive, but none of them are as noble as me.zts18895e	That's why I would use this opportunity to become the new archdemon. Then I can paint Hellord pink!zts18896e	If you help me, I promise I'll give you a great new partner. What do you say?zts18897e	(I haven't exactly had much time for dating since I became an adventurer... it's certainly an interesting offer!)zts18898e	(You consider the offer for a moment, then nod slowly.)zts18899e	(Hmm... and if she tries to spread peace in Hellord, then maybe even the conflict with the angels will finally be over?)zts18900e	(Yes! Then I wouldn't only be doing it for myself!)zts18901e	Hehe, sounds good! Right, first we need to make a vessel in which to store the goddess' energy.zts18902e	We're going to need some materials for that.zts18903e	It won't be easy, but please deal with that for me.zts18904e	Right, let's get started.zts18905e	(Lots of noise)zts18906e	Finished!zts18907e	Now we have a container for the energy.zts18908e	However, there is still one problem.zts18909e	Fernon can sense it.zts18910e	So we'll need to obscure the energy so that Fernon doesn't discover it.zts18911e	Can you bring me some Natural Magic Paper? I'll use it to obscure the energy.zts18912e	Here you go.zts18913e	Excellent! That's it then. All our preparations are finished.zts18914e	Fernon is sealed away in a hidden magic circle which is protected by Caligor.zts18915e	You can enter this circle by breaking the seal with the Akashic Records.zts18916e	I can give you the Akashic Records... but nothing in the world is free.zts18917e	Caligorzts18918e	Ah, you're earlier than I expected.zts18919e	Here are the Akashic Records.zts18920e	You can use them to face Fernon.zts18921e	(Your demeanour hardens.)zts18922e	Even if she isn't complete... argh!zts18923e	Such a pathetic mortal before me. But it's over now.zts18924e	*Just as Fernon is about to carry out the finishing blow, a mysterious aura rises up from Ancelloan's remains you are carrying, and prevents her movements.*zts18925e	Ancelloan's energy?!zts18926e	Why you perfidious little...! Argh!zts18927e	*Fernon disappears. Something stirs in the sealed remains.*zts18928e	It... it is over. I think it has absorbed Fernon's energy.zts18929e	When I take it to Kerzena, I'll no longer be alone!zts18930e	Yeah! You did it! Now Hellord will get a new archdemon. Hehehe!zts18931e	And... hahaha!zts18932e	What I said about a partner was a lie... sorry... hahaha!zts18933e	Instead...zts18934e	(Kerzena makes a heart with her fingers.)zts18935e	Take this instead. My heart belongs to you!zts18936e	(Oh fantastic!)zts18937e	Demons are not to be trusted, haha. Mind how you go!zts18938e	...Kerzenaaaaaa!zts18939e	Time-Space Explorerzts18940e	Do you know what a Time-Space is?zts18941e	What, you've never heard of them?zts18942e	They're mysterious tears in the fabric of space which appear all over Cylloan and create links to Mystic Heaven and Hellord.zts18943e	But they are fleeting...zts18944e	The tears appear for a certain length of time before disappearing again.zts18945e	Nobody knows why they appear or how they are created.zts18946e	Whatever. I could talk till I were blue in the face and you still wouldn't understand.zts18947e	What I really want is control of this place. I need all the information I can get about the Time-Space.zts18948e	Understood?zts18949e	If any other groups show up, then you'll have to... well... I don't need to spell it out, do I?zts18950e	Mwuhaha... sometimes you need to give a little to take a lot.zts18951e	Don't worry about it, okay?zts18952e	I hear they want to send even more people... hehehe.zts18953e	Those tenacious little... It appears they've sent some more people. Think you could help me again?zts18954e	One small sacrifice for a greater cause...zts18955e	Felice (Alchemist)zts18956e	Have you heard about Time-Spaces?zts18957e	Oh, then you know all about it already?zts18958e	Then this will be quick. I'm responsible for the research being carried out on Time-Spaces at the moment. The Time-Space in Cylloan is of particular interest. But I need a few details. Do you think you could find someone to help me?zts18959e	In return I'll tell you everything I know about the angels and demons.zts18960e	Wow! That's the first time I've ever seen any material like that.zts18961e	Interesting... and so powerful!zts18962e	Well, during my investigations it turned out that what you'd brought me wasn't sufficient.zts18963e	Do you think you could bring me something more powerful?zts18964e	Ah! I'm very nearly finished, but the materials just aren't sufficient!zts18965e	Please bring me some materials from the Time-Space for my investigations. That's the last time though, I promise.zts18966e	But remember, they need to be really powerful!zts18967e	A load of crusaders were recently injured on the battlefield, and they're being brought to Cylloan.zts18968e	Medicine is in short supply.zts18969e	Could you get me some more medicine for the crusaders?zts18970e	The styptic we use for treating their wounds is running out. I'll have to make some myself.zts18971e	Could you bring me the raw ingredients I need for making it?zts18972e	Panuelzts18973e	I heard there's something called Fernon's Essence. I'd love to get my hands on some of that! Could you bring me some?zts18974e	Eligoszts18975e	I heard there's something called Fernon's Essence. It's a mixture of divine power and dark energy.zts18976e	There's a good chance you can refine this to produce pure dark energy by extracting the divine power inside.zts18977e	I'll pay you a handsome price if you bring me some.zts18978e	I'm researching the material which transformed crusaders into evil spirits. Could you bring me some?zts18979e	That's the stuff.zts18980e	Now I need to study it.zts18981e	Here's your reward!zts18982e	Lilithzts18983e	Could you find my stolen jewellery for me?zts18984e	Find the Pure Mitrhil first.zts18985e	Oh. Hehe.zts18986e	I didn't really expect you would succeed. Very impressive! Here is your reward.zts18987e	Could you bring me some more of my stolen jewellery?zts18988e	Of course, you don't really have a choice in the matter. If you refuse... well, I'll come and visit you in your worst nightmares!zts18989e	Ha, there you are.zts18990e	There is a very rare gemstone which has been naturally accumulating mana over many years.zts18991e	They are extremely rare. Please bring me one.zts18992e	You're not going to refuse this time, are you?zts18993e	Finally, I have one! Woohoo!zts18994e	Many of those who fall on their missions carry prayers on their person.zts18995e	Can you bring me some of these prayers?zts18996e	I want to inscribe them into their gravestones.zts18997e	They were going to be the ones who shaped our future.zts18998e	And instead they die even sooner than old men like me.zts18999e	May they rest in peace in the earth mother's bosom.zts19000e	Crusaders are given Rosaries when they complete their training.zts19001e	They become an integral part of themselves.zts19002e	I'd like to embed them in their gravestones, so they can find peace in the afterlife.zts19003e	Can you help me?zts19004e	O divine creator!zts19005e	Take these your loyal servants into your bosom.zts19006e	Before crusaders head out on a mission, they always make sure to write a last will and testament.zts19007e	I should like to inform their families and ensure their earthly remains can rest in peace.zts19008e	But I don't know what I should tell the bereaved families...zts19009e	*cluck*? Are you busy? I need some help! *cluck*zts19010e	I need some Coolant. *cluck* Badly! *cluck* Bring me some, *cluck*zts19011e	Thank you! *cluck*zts19012e	Zenas has completely lost it because she cannot get any limited edition items. Go and calm her down.zts19013e	Thanks to you she feels better already.zts19014e	I hear that Erenia has been acting very strangely lately. Let's find out what's going on with her.zts19015e	She was totally hysterical... and it's only getting worse.zts19016e	Hey kiddo! Can you come over here?zts19017e	I've heard that someone has resurrected Caligor.zts19018e	That frightens me.zts19019e	Do whatever you can.zts19020e	Great job! Hehe.zts19021e	Legendary Hunterzts19022e	I've got a job for you. Defeat Kertos.zts19023e	Well done!zts19024e	There's a nasty little spider causing trouble.zts19025e	Please deal with it.zts19026e	This is for you. Bet that's more than you expected, huh? There was a big bounty on that beast's head.zts19027e	Rumour has it that Grenigas has arisen once more.zts19028e	Fortunately, he hasn't fully recovered yet, so he isn't as strong as he once was.zts19029e	Defeat him before he can recover all of his strength.zts19030e	Oh wow, very impressive!zts19031e	Lord Draco is up to no good in the Region of the Burning Sword. Can you go and calm the waters?zts19032e	Impudent little lizard...zts19033e	Hey, I've heard that dragon blood is pretty good for your stamina...zts19034e	Have you brought anything?zts19035e	What?! You just got here?!zts19036e	What the...zts19037e	Bah, so useless...zts19038e	Here, take this.zts19039e	Glacerus' Mane is quite expensive at the moment.zts19040e	Wow, that's one quality mane.zts19041e	A little birdy has told me that Witch Laurena is still alive. Can you see if that's true?zts19042e	Rumour has it she's a feast for the eyes...zts19043e	Libelzts19044e	Please, give those obnoxious demons a serious roasting!zts19045e	The unfaltering light will always be victorious!zts19046e	Harpagozts19047e	Time to show these insolent angels who's boss!zts19048e	Darkness consumes everything!zts19049e	We must help these evil spirits to find peace.zts19050e	Do you think you could help us?zts19051e	Hopefully they find peace in the afterlife.zts19052e	If you can render the Brainwashed Crusaders harmless, maybe the priests can heal them.zts19053e	Boah, that was tough!zts19054e	We have no idea what we're supposed to do with these crazy crusaders.zts19055e	Please bring them peace.zts19056e	We will not forget your deeds.zts19057e	Astarothzts19058e	Defeat the guardians in the area around Mystic Heaven. You're up to such a task, right?zts19059e	No problem!zts19060e	But... why am I doing this?zts19061e	If you kill Rozhanik in Mystic Heaven rather than me, I'll pay you well. What do you say?zts19062e	Woah, that was close!zts19063e	Rumour among the demons has it that the angel Esther is an excellent markswoman.zts19064e	Please find out if that's really true.zts19065e	Oooh, that was a close one.zts19066e	Now I know why Esther is such a good shot.zts19067e	I've been wanting to deal with the angels for some time now.zts19068e	Defeat Lazekiel in the area around Mystic Heaven.zts19069e	But I don't want to...zts19070e	Life's tough sometimes... I'm sorry.zts19071e	Hey! You know we're talking about Mysticaron, right?zts19072e	He challenged me. Go to Mystic Heaven and silence him.zts19073e	Errr... if I don't get my reward, I'm going to give that Astaroth a damn good thrashing!zts19074e	Sometimes it's more difficult for someone with mental issues than a normal guy.zts19075e	Word has reached me that it's currently very difficult to spy on people in Mystic Heaven because of some fanatics. They're totally crazy.zts19076e	Go get them! I'll cover your costs.zts19077e	Sometimes it's more difficult for someone with mental issues than a normal guy.zts19078e	That was really difficult.zts19079e	Kirelzts19080e	Eliminate the Ghastly Spearmen around Hellord.zts19081e	Throwing spears from a distance isn't as easy as it looks.zts19082e	Now I understand why Kirel was so annoyed.zts19083e	Cut down the ignorant Tallion in the area around Hellord. He's only interested in fighting.zts19084e	That fight was brutal.zts19085e	Please eliminate Rement. The fool thinks he's a dab hand with a bow and arrow.zts19086e	Archers are never really that dangerous.zts19087e	Not all demons are stupid. I've heard of some pretty smart ones in my time. I'm told the conflict in this region has caused a lot of damage.zts19088e	Strategy and tactics are touchy topics, but if you kill this guy, I'll reward you for it.zts19089e	He's smart, and a decent fighter.zts19090e	Wow, that was tricky.zts19091e	Please eliminate 5 Bacooms in the area around Hellord.zts19092e	They may be old, but a balrog is a balrog.zts19093e	Time-Space Explorerzts19094e	How do you feel?zts19095e	Our investigations are running smoothly, thanks to your help.zts19096e	It's for a good cause.zts19097e	Alright, but that remains just between the two of us. Understood?zts19098e	Was that it? I feel a little stronger.zts19099e	Well done!zts19100e	Excellent! That's enough.zts19101e	I'll start the experiment now.zts19102e	Thanks!zts19103e	Thanks.zts19104e	Then I'll have to make some medicine.zts19105e	Wounded Crusaderzts19106e	Argh... help me...zts19107e	The wound is... rather... deep... argh!zts19108e	Right from the start, the order has been watching over the world according to Ancelloan's will.zts19109e	A Floatstone, *cluck*.zts19110e	A Fragment of the Fernon Tree, *cluck*.zts19111e	Some Coolant, *cluck*.zts19112e	A Frost Crystal, *cluck*.zts19113e	That's what I need! *cluck*zts19114e	*cluck*?! Improve the engine? No! *cluck* We have to repair it! *cluck*zts19115e	*cluck* That's nothing to do with airsickness... *cluck*...zts19116e	Hmm... don't seem to be any survivors here.zts19117e	I need to see if there are any tracks. Maybe there are survivors somewhere.zts19118e	Hey! Are you all right?zts19119e	Ugh...zts19120e	Oh no, I was saving that for an emergency...zts19121e	Erm...zts19122e	The members of the patrol kept a diary about their discoveries.zts19123e	I had one as well, but I must have lost it somewhere.zts19124e	Do you know anything about it?zts19125e	I can't remember everything, but I can probably help a little.zts19126e	Right, I guess I'll have to find these journals.zts19127e	Those are... crusaders.zts19128e	According to these records:zts19129e	The patrol was attacked by unidentified creatures.zts19130e	After forcing them to swallow an unknown object...zts19131e	... they transformed into evil spirits.zts19132e	(The crusader looks at you as if he wants to say something, but then closes his eyes.)zts19133e	(The dead crusader is holding a mysterious crystal in his hands.)zts19134e	Is this it? I'll have to show this to the Crusader Captain.zts19135e	But I've discovered another story in the ancient texts.zts19136e	Ancelloan carried both the power of good and evil within her. But the good was stronger.zts19137e	For the same reason, the Slade tribe also carried this spark within them. But they chose the path of violence and war.zts19138e	They claim to do honour to their goddess... very interesting.zts19139e	Be that as it may... these texts suggest that the dark side of Ancelloan had always been waiting for an opportunity to gain the upper hand.zts19140e	The dark side created a clone to further inflame the conflict between the gods of the sun and moon.zts19141e	This resulted in a great war.zts19142e	Fascinating, isn't it? If all of that is true...zts19143e	Well, then Ancelloan wasn't annihilated after all.zts19144e	She merely lost control over the power of light and was swallowed by the darkness.zts19145e	You came to me to prove that these ancient texts are true.zts19146e	The crystal contains the energy of both.zts19147e	(Am I carrying both good and evil within me?)zts19148e	(Is this crystal all that's left of Ancelloan?)zts19149e	I have to tell the Crusader Captain what I've learned.zts19150e	*Suddenly, a bright light appears and shows the way like a compass.*zts19151e	What... should I follow the light?zts19152e	It's pointing towards Glacernon...zts19153e	Then Fernon must be in Glacernon!zts19154e	Well, after defeating Caligor, I'll have to go there.zts19155e	The end of an exhausting journey is nearing its end.zts19156e	A human?zts19157e	I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you.zts19158e	You should return to Cylloan and get yourself treated.zts19159e	That's okay. The adventurer...zts19160e	We might run into problems on the way to Cylloan.zts19161e	Please go.zts19162e	What do you mean? That's ridiculous.zts19163e	We must return together.zts19164e	Enough talk, go already! The monsters can smell my blood. They will be here soon.zts19165e	I'll deal with them.zts19166e	Please tell the Crusader Captain that I'm sorry.zts19167e	And...zts19168e	(Suddenly a monster appears and attacks you and the crusader.)zts19169e	(You defeat the monster in a tough battle, but the crusader's wounds don't stop bleeding.)zts19170e	I'm glad I could save you.zts19171e	Now I can rest at Ancelloan's side.zts19172e	Evil spirits and... (His voice becomes ever fainter.) The Slades are... I'm so tired...zts19173e	(The crusader closes his eyes and passes away.)zts19174e	I'll tell the Crusader Captain his last words.zts19175e	Thank you for staying by his side.zts19176e	It surely wasn't easy, but at least you've found a clue.zts19177e	Hey, you with the covetous soul. What are you doing here?zts19178e	Do you know what this is?zts19179e	(You give Kerzena the object containing the divine power and dark energy.)zts19180e	Did no one survive this battle?zts19181e	From the brightest light comes the darkest night.zts19182e	Fernon's Punishmentzts19183e	'The punishment will be carried out and no one can stop it!'zts19194e	Barnizts19195e	Long time no see! How are you?zts19196e	Adventurerzts19197e	Barni...? Is that really you?zts19198e	Unbelievable...zts19199e	Yes, our bravery was rewarded. We've been allowed into Valhalla.zts19200e	However, we wouldn't have managed it without your help. That's why we only came as far as the entrance. We weren't allowed across the threshold into Valhalla.zts19201e	We're so happy to be allowed into Valhalla. It's just such a pity that we can't go any further.zts19202e	Anyway... Do you think you could help us?zts19203e	How would I be able to help?zts19204e	Hmm... I am not sure.zts19205e	Maybe the Avenging Angel knows more. She's responsible for judging every warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla.zts19206e	Let's pay a visit to the Avenging Angel.zts19207e	Friggzts19208e	I've never seen you before. Who are you?zts19209e	Hello! I'm a friend of Barni's.zts19210e	I've come to ask for your help.zts19211e	Let me guess. Barni's family wants to enter Valhalla. Am I right?zts19212e	Right!zts19213e	For the dead to enter Valhalla, a warrior has to do a good deed in their name.zts19214e	I will judge whether or not you are a worthy warrior.zts19215e	Eliminate the Wolves on Mount Krem.zts19216e	Then eliminate the raging Warepards at the Fernon Temple.zts19217e	Finally, eliminate the strongest enemies.zts19218e	Crikey, that was tough.zts19219e	You have passed the test, warrior.zts19220e	You've proven that you are worthy.zts19221e	But you're still a foreigner.zts19222e	As such, I cannot recognise your deeds.zts19223e	But there is another way...zts19224e	Find a Viking who can help you.zts19225e	Right, I'll get looking then.zts19226e	Ragnarzts19227e	Who are you?zts19228e	I'm an adventurer from NosVille.zts19229e	I need your help, Viking.zts19230e	(You explain your story.)zts19231e	Hmm, I'm not sure whether I should believe you.zts19232e	But as it's for Vikings, I'll help you.zts19233e	But there's one proviso for my help:zts19234e	You must also do me a favour.zts19235e	Promise me. You scratch my back...zts19236e	(Avenging Angel, the Messenger of the Gods.)zts19237e	I promise.zts19238e	Before we go, there's still something I have to deal with.zts19239e	I owe the smithy some money.zts19240e	How much then?zts19241e	2 million gold.zts19242e	2 million gold...!zts19243e	Give him 2 million gold so he can pay off his debts.zts19244e	That's too much. Let's talk to Teodor Topp. Maybe we can settle the debt some other way.zts19245e	That's not a gift, mind. I'm only loaning you the money.zts19246e	LOANING!zts19247e	Oh, that's very generous of you!zts19248e	Right, now those debts are sorted, let's mosey.zts19249e	I pay back my favours a hundredfold.zts19250e	Here, let me give you my favourite clothes.zts19251e	(This will be a difficult adventure.)zts19253e	You are now ready to travel.zts19254e	But before you tread the path of the warrior, you must offer up a sacrifice.zts19255e	Eliminate the pirates and bring me Angel's Feathers.zts19256e	Eliminate the enemies.zts19257e	The gods smile on your journey.zts19258e	The first task on your path of the warrior:zts19259e	Kill the evil dragon Fafnir in Castle Aria and offer up his treasures as a gift to the gods.zts19260e	Odin and Valhalla's warriors will watch over you.zts19261e	May Odin's Blessing be with you.zts19262e	I'll need allies if I'm to defeat the dragon.zts19264e	I'll talk to Teodor Topp first.zts19265e	Oh, that's very generous of you!zts19266e	Hello Teodor.zts19267e	I'm here to talk about Ragnar's debts.zts19268e	Do you think I could do you a favour and settle his debts that way? Unfortunately I don't have enough money to pay them off directly.zts19269e	Teodor Toppzts19270e	Hmm... alright. I guess we can come to some kind of arrangement.zts19271e	I don't have enough steel to satisfy all my orders.zts19272e	Bring more some more steel from the mines.zts19273e	Eliminate the Giant Gamecocks at Fernon Outpost.zts19274e	Eliminate the bugs on Mount Krem.zts19275e	Eliminate the monsters in Glacernon.zts19276e	Eliminate Wollets.zts19277e	Eliminate the Chicken King.zts19278e	Eliminate Mother Cuby.zts19279e	Eliminate Ginseng.zts19280e	And finally, eliminate Dark Castra.zts19281e	That was the final task. Excellent work!zts19282e	Adventurerzts19283e	I've paid off your debts, Ragnar.zts19284e	Ragnarzts19285e	Thank you!zts19286e	These clothes may not look like much, but I love them.zts19287e	You'll find great comfort in them as they protect you from the cold.zts19288e	Friggzts19289e	I've been watching the progress of your journey.zts19290e	For your first task, you must kill the greedy and evil dragon Fafnir, who watches over his treasure in the old Castle Aria in Valhalla.zts19291e	May Odin's Blessing be with you.zts19292e	Maybe Frigg knows. She's responsible for judging every warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla.zts19293e	Then let's pay Frigg a visit.zts19294e	I've never seen you before. I am Frigg, Messenger of the Gods.zts19295e	Who are you?zts19296e	(The Avenging Angel... The Messenger of the Gods...)zts19297e	I've found an ally, Frigg.zts19298e	(To be continued.)zts19299e	Barni's Soul (NosVille)zts19300e	Frigg (Port Alveus)zts19301e	Ragnar (NosVille)zts19302e	Ragnarzts19303e	Ragnar, do you know anything of the dragon Fafnir?zts19304e	Fafnir... That's a name I haven't heard for a long time.zts19305e	Yes, I know him.zts19306e	I know him very well, in fact.zts19307e	How could I ever forget that name?zts19308e	No, that name will stay in my memory forever.zts19309e	Midgard, my homeland, was...zts19310e	Very beautiful.zts19311e	Before the dragon came.zts19312e	He came out of the darkness and suddenly attacked my home city.zts19313e	We Vikings gathered our courage and fought against him.zts19314e	But we were too weak to defeat him...zts19315e	Only a few of us survived to tell the tale. But our home was lost, and we were forced to wander like nomads.zts19316e	That dragon's name was Fafnir.zts19317e	That's why I spend my life on the roads, concentrating on improving myself.zts19318e	I want to get my revenge, but to do that, I must became stronger.zts19319e	I'll help you.zts19320e	If we can gather some allies, maybe we can defeat him.zts19321e	Midgard is the rightful home of the Vikings.zts19322e	I will defeat him and restore our home to us.zts19323e	Okay! Let's do it!zts19324e	Just you wait, Fafnir.zts19325e	Ragnar, do you have a plan?zts19326e	First, we must rally our allies and gather more information.zts19327e	We should head to Midgard to learn as much as we can.zts19328e	It's been a very long time since I was last in my home city.zts19329e	It's a strange feeling.zts19330e	The atmosphere here is completely different now.zts19331e	I can feel a disruptive force.zts19332e	Here... it's coming from over here...zts19333e	These ruins were once a watchtower.zts19334e	When Fafnir attacked the city, he burned the tower to the ground with his fiery breath.zts19335e	It was chaos.zts19336e	There's no way to prepare for Fafnir's attacks.zts19337e	Even though I try to forget it, I can't help thinking back to that day.zts19338e	Strange... it's not the right time of year for snow.zts19339e	Where on earth is this snowfall coming from?zts19340e	Maybe it's Fafnir's doing.zts19341e	Even the monsters were weaker back then.zts19342e	They're much more powerful now...zts19343e	I managed to land a critical hit on one.zts19344e	But the monster still didn't die!zts19345e	I reckon Fafnir's behind it all.zts19346e	Pleased to meet you. Ragnar, the great Viking warrior.zts19347e	The pleasure is all mine.zts19348e	Avenging Angelzts19349e	What's the Messenger of the Gods still doing in this world?zts19350e	The souls of the Vikings slain by Fafnir cannot reach Valhalla.zts19351e	They simply disappeared, with no chance for them to find peace.zts19352e	I dreamt I was in Asgard.zts19353e	In my dream, a great evil had befallen us.zts19354e	Not even the Vikings could withstand Fafnir's attacks.zts19355e	I must prepare for the future.zts19356e	And I must kill Fafnir, and bring solace to the souls of the fallen Vikings. That's why I'm here.zts19357e	Fantastic!zts19358e	The Messenger of the Gods will help us!zts19359e	That's such great news!zts19360e	Let's go to the castle and kill the dragon!zts19361e	Please, calm down.zts19362e	By the way, what is that magic circle surrounding Castle Aria?zts19363e	That's the magic circle of sleep.zts19364e	These magic circles place Fafnir in hibernation, and prevent him from leaving the castle.zts19365e	But to keep the magic circles in place, I cannot move from this spot.zts19366e	If you need my help, you'll have to find someone who has the power to maintain these magic circles.zts19367e	When Fafnir attackedzts19368e	you weren't the only Viking to survive, Ragnar.zts19369e	Some mages also got away.zts19370e	Both the student and the master survived.zts19371e	I thought all the mages were dead...zts19372e	But some have survived!zts19373e	Friggzts19374e	Please find her.zts19375e	Viking Magezts19376e	Who are you?zts19377e	You surely can't be... a Viking?zts19378e	What? You're not a Viking, are you?zts19379e	Why are you searching for Vikings?zts19380e	Now, now, where are your manners? You should introduce yourself before asking questions.zts19381e	My name is Erdimien. I'm a Viking mage.zts19382e	Word has it that you have a grievance with Fafnir.zts19383e	I need your help.zts19384e	Let's defeat this dragon together.zts19385e	Hey stranger.zts19386e	When Fafnir attacked, my father...zts19387e	... wanted us to run away. He said that he would follow us.zts19388e	But we never saw him again...zts19389e	Which means...zts19390e	But everyone says that dying on the battlefield is the greatest honour a Viking can earn...zts19391e	No, it's not!zts19392e	Do you know what it's like to lose your family?zts19393e	There's no such thing as an honourable death!zts19394e	When we die... that's it!zts19395e	The Avenging Angel, the warriors' loyal companion...zts19396e	She must have guided my father as well.zts19397e	She looks after those who fall in battle.zts19398e	And if I help you, I'll be helping her at the same time.zts19399e	So I'm not going to help.zts19400e	She let my father die! I can never forgive her for that.zts19401e	But Fafnir killed your father, not the Avenging Angel.zts19402e	Silence! I don't want to hear it!zts19403e	Go away! Leave me alone!zts19404e	Frigg, we found the Viking mage.zts19405e	However... there's a problem.zts19406e	Well...zts19407e	When Fafnir attackedzts19408e	her father was killed. She blames you for his death.zts19409e	I didn't guide the souls of those killed by Fafnir.zts19410e	Or rather, I couldn't guide them.zts19411e	The souls of those fallen to Fafnir's assault simply disappeared.zts19412e	I couldn't find a single Viking soul in Midgard.zts19413e	I suspect that Fafnir absorbed all of the souls of the Vikings he killed.zts19414e	Besides, I think her father is still alive.zts19415e	It is weak, but I can feel the Viking's energy.zts19416e	She has to hear this!zts19417e	Erdimienzts19418e	I thought I told you to get lost!zts19419e	Calm down for a moment and listen to me.zts19420e	I'm not interested!zts19421e	Your father isn't dead.zts19422e	After we met, I went and talked to the Avenging Angel.zts19423e	She says that your father is still alive.zts19424e	What?! My father... isn't dead?!zts19425e	Is that true?zts19426e	Is that true?!zts19427e	Absolutely. The Messenger of the Gods never lies.zts19428e	But then... why hasn't he returned?zts19429e	Maybe there's a reason why he didn't come back for you.zts19430e	I will try to find out for you.zts19431e	Okay. If you can find out for me...zts19432e	... then I'll help you to defeat Fafnir.zts19433e	Adventurerzts19434e	(Hmm... we should probably go to Midgard first.)zts19435e	(That's where everything started.)zts19436e	(Maybe I can find some clues there.)zts19437e	(Let's take a look around town.)zts19438e	Maybe I'll find a clue.zts19439e	If I carry on like this, I won't find anything...zts19440e	(Maybe the monsters can tell me something. Let's beat up a few and find out.)zts19441e	Can that be...?zts19442e	Haven't I seen this mask somewhere before?zts19443e	Ah! Now I remember, I saw this mask in the desert.zts19444e	But when or where exactly, I don't know any more.zts19445e	I should return to the desert.zts19446e	Wow, it's really hot here.zts19447e	It doesn't matter how often I come here, I'll never get used to it.zts19448e	Hmm... how can I find someone who recognises this mask?zts19449e	Wait, I know! I'll search for the Desert Robbers!zts19450e	Let's go!zts19451e	I'm not sure which of the Desert Robbers will know anything about this mask...zts19452e	I'll just have to ask them all.zts19453e	Hey, do you know anything about this mask?zts19454e	Err... no, not a clue. Who are you?zts19455e	Hmm... maybe they're too unimportant to know anything.zts19456e	I'll have to find some higher ranking Desert Robbers.zts19457e	Hey!zts19458e	Wake up!zts19459e	Have you ever seen this before?zts19460e	Do you really think I would tell you?zts19461e	Such loyalty.zts19462e	They won't tell me anything.zts19463e	I need to talk to the desert settlers about this mask.zts19464e	I should talk to the Harbour Guard first of all.zts19465e	Hello.zts19466e	Have you ever seen this mask before?zts19467e	Harbour Guardzts19468e	Hmm... No.zts19469e	I've been here for a very long time.zts19470e	But that's the first time I've ever laid eyes on that mask.zts19471e	Maybe President Noah, the desert merchant, knows something about it.zts19472e	He's moving through the desert with his followers.zts19473e	Hello, President Noah.zts19474e	Have you ever seen this mask before?zts19475e	That mask... yes, I think I've seen it some place...zts19476e	But I don't remember exactly.zts19477e	I'd have to check my journal.zts19478e	Hold your horses. I only said I *might* look in my journal.zts19479e	I didn't say that I would help you.zts19480e	Huh?zts19481e	As you know, I'm a merchant.zts19482e	Trading is what I do.zts19483e	Even in information.zts19484e	So... how much is it worth to you?zts19485e	What? You want me to pay for your help?zts19486e	Haha, you're so naive.zts19487e	I don't want money from you.zts19488e	I want your help in return.zts19489e	When I go on my trade journey, I want you to protect me from the monsters.zts19490e	So, are you going to tell me now?zts19491e	Noahzts19492e	Ah, there you are.zts19493e	Sorry, I can't remember where I put my journal.zts19494e	It might take a while before I find it again.zts19495e	Could you eliminate a few more monsters for me?zts19496e	Hmm... alright then.zts19497e	Thank you.zts19498e	Woah, it's hot...zts19499e	Great to see you again.zts19500e	You were a great help to me on my journey. Now I've got something to tell you.zts19501e	I found an entry in my old journal about the mask.zts19502e	The mask belongs to the leader of the Desert Robbers.zts19503e	As far as I know, however, there has only ever been one Captain of the Desert Robbers.zts19504e	And I never heard anything about him losing a mask.zts19505e	If you want to know more about the mask, you should talk to its owner.zts19506e	I see.zts19507e	Do you know where the Captain of the Desert Robbers can be found?zts19508e	Hmm, no, I couldn't be sure.zts19509e	But the Desert Robbers are bound to know.zts19510e	I need to track down the Commander of the Desert Robbers and found out where their leader is.zts19511e	(I need to find out where the leader is.)zts19512e	The commander tells me that the captain is in the old Aster Temple.zts19513e	There he is.zts19514e	Wait!zts19515e	Almost there.zts19516e	Finally, we meet at last.zts19517e	Who are you? And how did you get in here?zts19518e	Are you one of the merchants' assassins?zts19519e	You pesky little...!zts19520e	Captain of the Desert Robberszts19521e	I'm no assassin.zts19522e	I just have a few questions.zts19523e	Do you know what this is?zts19524e	...!zts19525e	Why you stinking little...!zts19526e	He seems to know something...zts19527e	I need to follow him.zts19528e	How did you get that mask?!zts19529e	If you don't tell me what you know about this maskzts19530e	then you'll wake up tomorrow morning in prison.zts19531e	And you'll never see the desert again.zts19532e	Don't be stupid. Do you really think I'd give up so easily?zts19533e	Give it up! Can't you see the situation is hopeless?zts19534e	Your men can't help you now.zts19535e	This is your last chance. Tell me everything you know about this.zts19536e	You'd better be a bandit, and not an adventurer.zts19537e	Haha... Okay, but promise me you'll let us go if I tell you everything about the mask.zts19538e	Otherwise you won't hear a peep out of me.zts19539e	I promise.zts19540e	A long time ago I received this mask from my tribe when I left my home.zts19541e	It was traditional for anyone leaving their home to receive a mask.zts19542e	Home... where is home exactly?zts19543e	In Jotunheim.zts19544e	Jotunheim... I need to go there.zts19545e	Utegardazts19546e	Hello! Am I in Jotunheim?zts19547e	Yes, this is Jotunheim.zts19548e	Do you know anything about this mask?zts19549e	That...! Why that's a Scout Mask!zts19550e	Only emigrants or scouts are allowed to wear that mask.zts19551e	Where did you get it?zts19552e	(You explain everything that happened.)zts19553e	The Vikings regularly attack us Goths, plundering anything that isn't nailed down.zts19554e	So we sent scouts into the Viking lands to prevent these attacks.zts19555e	There were a number of skirmishes.zts19556e	Maybe someone lost their mask during the fighting.zts19557e	One day one of our scouts reported that the Viking city was in flames.zts19558e	We sent a larger group of scouts out to confirm this report.zts19559e	Surprisingly, the scout was telling the truth.zts19560e	Smoke was billowing out of the city, and the streets were strewn with the bodies of dead Vikings.zts19561e	The information on the city's destruction came from one of our scouts.zts19562e	If you want to learn more, maybe you should try talking to that scout.zts19563e	Right, I'll do that. Thanks.zts19564e	Are you the scout who spied on the Viking city?zts19565e	Yes, but how did you know that?zts19566e	Utegarda over there told me.zts19567e	Could you tell me about it?zts19568e	That's Viking business.zts19569e	It's none of your concern.zts19570e	Well, it only really involves the Vikings...zts19571e	But the situation is pretty dire.zts19572e	If you do me a favour, I'll tell you everything.zts19573e	What favour?zts19574e	Scoutzts19575e	I need some materials so I can create a disguise outfit for spying on the Vikings.zts19576e	If you bring them to me, I'll tell you what you want to know.zts19577e	I'll be right back.zts19578e	Here you go.zts19579e	Please tell me what you know.zts19580e	Okay.zts19581e	But you have to keep what I tell you to yourself.zts19582e	When we arrived in the Viking city, there wasn't a soul to be seen.zts19583e	The city was burning.zts19584e	We looked everywhere but couldn't find anything useful.zts19585e	So we returned, empty-handed.zts19586e	Please tell me the truth.zts19587e	Honest, that is the truth! When we arrived in the city it was already burning, and there were dead Vikings lying everywhere. But we found a warehouse.zts19588e	We figured the Vikings had abandoned the warehouse...zts19589e	... so we decided to clear it out.zts19590e	We wanted to punish the Vikings for all the times they had looted from us. So we tied up the guard, snatched everything we could from the warehouse, and returned here.zts19591e	But then I realised that by acting like that, we were no better than the Vikings who were always attacking us. So I went back to release the guard, but he had already escaped.zts19592e	That's all that happened.zts19593e	Is it all clear now?zts19594e	Crystal clear.zts19595e	Thanks for telling me everything.zts19596e	I'll have to tell Erdimien about this.zts19597e	Erdimien, I think I've learned something interesting about your father.zts19598e	Your father isn't dead.zts19599e	After Fafnir attacked the city, one of the Goth scouts found your father.zts19600e	He tied him to a pillar, but the Avenging Angel claims your father is still alive.zts19601e	He must have freed himself and escaped.zts19602e	Thank you!zts19603e	I'll help you to defeat Fafnir.zts19604e	And I will look for my father.zts19605e	But I still cannot forgive the Avenging Angel.zts19606e	She didn't help us when Fafnir attacked the city.zts19607e	If she'd helped us, this disaster wouldn't have happened.zts19608e	And now she wants to kill the dragon all of a sudden?zts19609e	Ha! Very funny.zts19610e	The gods can't just involve themselves in the affairs of men whenever they want.zts19611e	I'm only here because of the dangers I saw in my dreams.zts19612e	And because Odin ordered me to prepare for it.zts19613e	Then let's go and defeat Fafnir.zts19614e	As soon as anyone enters the castle, it will set off an alarm to alert Fafnir.zts19615e	Using this key, you can deactivate the alarm.zts19616e	Finally... Barni, wait for me...zts19617e	Who are you?zts19618e	I'm here to help you.zts19619e	I hear that you want to defeat the dragon. That's why I came here with my warriors. Looks like we're too late.zts19620e	You really killed the dragon...zts19621e	Don't make me laugh! Do you really think I don't know how you Goths tick?zts19622e	You sneaky Goths are just pretending to help us, but in reality you just want to steal our valuables.zts19623e	Don't get smart with me!zts19624e	Do you doubt our integrity?zts19625e	We want to help make up for our mistakes, not enrich ourselves!zts19626e	Quiet!zts19627e	...! Ragnar, what the...? There's no reason to fight them.zts19628e	They aren't warriors, they're only thieves.zts19629e	I've punished the thieves.zts19630e	Ragnar, I heard you killed all the Goths who arrived after the dragon was slain.zts19631e	What did you do that for?zts19632e	Killing people who are weaker than you are and who don't want to fight is dishonourable. Don't you remember?zts19633e	I did what I had to do.zts19634e	And I don't consider it dishonourable.zts19635e	Frigg, Ragnar didn't seem quite right when he returned covered in the dragon's blood.zts19636e	He acted so... so strange.zts19637e	Aggressive and bloodthirsty... like a beast!zts19638e	You can't leave him like that.zts19639e	You're right.zts19640e	I know my body.zts19641e	I'm completely normal.zts19642e	Erdimien, I wanted to talk to you about rebuilding the city.zts19643e	Let's talk outside.zts19644e	We've slain the dragon...zts19645e	But I get the feeling that something isn't right.zts19646e	I think these phenomena are related to something else I saw.zts19647e	We should have a think about that.zts19648e	If the Goths find out what happened to their warriors...zts19649e	They surely wouldn't stand idly by and do nothing.zts19650e	Sigh...zts19651e	Key to Castle Ariazts19652e	Trainingzts19653e	Pork Belly and a Good Drinkzts19654e	Smoked Pork Bellyzts19655e	Defeating Monsterszts19656e	Food for Staminazts19657e	If you bring me the ingredients, I'll forge the key for you.zts19658e	I don't really like to admit the fact...zts19659e	But if the Avenging Angel hadn't helped us, we'd never have defeated Fafnir.zts19660e	Well, experiencing that once is enough for a lifetime.zts19661e	I need to train and become even stronger.zts19662e	It's still not enough, I must become much stronger.zts19663e	Have you ever heard of pork belly?zts19664e	Take some pork belly and roast it till it's nice and crisp... ah, delicious! *drooling*zts19665e	Oh yes! Thank you!zts19666e	Grilled pork belly is absolutely delicious.zts19667e	But smoked pork belly isn't half bad either!zts19668e	Damn it! I'll never be able to stick to my diet!zts19669e	The town guards have been injured by monsters in the region.zts19670e	Can you deal with the creatures for us?zts19671e	Thank you!zts19672e	Here, take this.zts19673e	Hmm... Hey!zts19674e	Can you do me a small favour?zts19675e	If you have some time to spare, could you bring me a few globs of slime?zts19676e	I understand it's good for virility... Hmm...zts19677e	Ahem... but that's just between you and me, okay?zts19678e	What are you looking at?zts19679e	Pleased to meet you, stranger.zts19680e	For the tribe.zts19681e	(Ragnar hesitates, looks around while the Avenging Angel is talking and discovers the magic circle.)zts19682e	(You reveal the name.)zts19683e	(You tell the story of the search for the Viking mage.)zts19684e	(Erdimien's facial expression hardens.)zts19685e	That means we're still alive, right?zts19686e	(Lost in thought...)zts19687e	(I should go to the Desert Harbour.)zts19688e	(The Captain of the Desert Robbers has run away.)zts19689e	(You show the captain the mask.)zts19690e	(The Captain of the Desert Robbers has run away again.)zts19691e	In Jotunheim. But you can't go there yet.zts19692e	You'll find our tribes somewhere in the desert.zts19693e	Track them down, if you can.zts19694e	Utegarda over there told me.zts19695e	(You talk to the guard about Barni's situation and ask him for help.)zts19696e	(His eyes flicker.)zts19697e	Suddenly, one of the Vikings blocks our path.zts19698e	Is it all clear now?zts19699e	I'll have to tell Erdimien about this.zts19700e	After Fafnir attacked the city, one of the Goth scouts found your father.zts19701e	(You tell Frigg everything that happened.)zts19702e	(After a fierce battle, we were able to defeat Fafnir.)zts19703e	(Ragnar dealt Fafnir the final blow.zts19704e	Fafnir fell to the ground and Ragnar roared with joy to celebrate his revenge. He was covered in Fafnir's blood.)zts19705e	(Goths are standing outside in front of the castle.)zts19706e	(Ragnar spoke with furious anger in his voice.)zts19707e	(After Ragnar was covered in the dragon's blood, he started to act differently... so aggressive and violent.)zts19708e	(I need to stop him, but my body doesn't want to move.)zts19709e	(Ragnar drew his weapon and attacked the Goths. Now they're all dead.)zts19710e	(Erdimien thinks Ragnar acted correctly.)zts19711e	(Ragnar and Erdimien go outside together.)zts19712e	(Frigg also leaves.)zts19713e	If the Goths find out what happened to their warriors...zts19714e	Fafnir Clipzts19715e	I will devour all you foolish Vikings!zts19716e	But if the Avenging Angel hadn't helped us, we'd never have defeated Fafnir.zts19718e	It doesn't matter what you think... This is really odd, Frigg.zts19719e	Isn't it all over yet?zts19720e	I think you worry too much.zts19721e	If your thoughts are too distracting, you should clear your mind.zts19722e	Do I really think too much?zts19723e	No, my instincts have never let me down.zts19724e	Well, if that's what you want I won't stop you.zts19725e	I have to meet Ragnar and find out.zts19726e	How do you feel, Ragnar?zts19727e	Here, I've brought you some food.zts19728e	Now, any progress asking your Viking family for entrance into Valhalla?zts19729e	Oh. I was so busy that I forgot all about it.zts19730e	By the way I need to ask you something.zts19731e	What about?zts19732e	Why did you defeat all those Goths back then?zts19733e	They were the first sacrifice that I made on my journey.zts19734e	Once I've joined all the clans together, I'll become king of the Vikings.zts19735e	It is my goal to make the whole continent my kingdom.zts19736e	(A dark red mist swirls around Ragnar's body.)zts19737e	Do you truly believe Lord Cuarry's family and the NosCamp will allow that to happen?zts19738e	I will remove anyone who interferes.zts19739e	Even if some of them are old friends.zts19740e	(He thinks for a moment, then throws me a cold look and carries on.)zts19741e	Erdimien has agreed to join me.zts19742e	What's your answer?zts19743e	The Vikings have only just freed themselves from Fafnir's iron grip.zts19744e	They will never follow someone who wants to start a war for no reason.zts19745e	That's my answer.zts19746e	The Vikings live for battle and believe in the law of the strongest.zts19747e	If they refuse to follow me then I will bring them to their knees.zts19748e	Leave now. I'm letting you go.zts19749e	But next time I will not be so merciful.zts19750e	My suspicions have been confirmed, Frigg.zts19751e	(You tell Frigg everything.)zts19752e	What's so bad about him wanting to be king?zts19753e	The Vikings have only just freed themselves from Fafnir's iron grip and found peace.zts19754e	The Vikings live for battle and believe in the law of the strongest.zts19755e	That is the law of the Vikings.zts19756e	Then what do the weak or the peace loving people do?zts19757e	The people that live here suffer the most from the scourge of war.zts19758e	That is the fate of the weak.zts19759e	They may be despised and persecuted for their weakness,zts19760e	but that isn't their fault. Society is to blame.zts19761e	If no one will protect them, then I will.zts19762e	(I should meet with the Goths first.)zts19763e	Before we go, let's pick up a few treasures from Fafnir's warehouse.zts19764e	We should look for things that the Goths will really like.zts19765e	Phew...zts19766e	I think we have enough now.zts19767e	Long time no see, Utegarda.zts19768e	How are you? Here. A gift for you.zts19769e	Wow... It's really you! It's been such a long time.zts19770e	(He was just smiling, but now he's become serious and quiet.)zts19771e	Why exactly did you knock out all of our scouts?zts19772e	Did you think we didn't know?zts19773e	That... That was a misunderstanding!zts19774e	Today you will speak the truth if you want to leave this place alive.zts19775e	(You tell him everything.)zts19776e	And I'm meant to believe that?zts19777e	Pff, ridiculous!zts19778e	But I just told you the truth.zts19779e	Alright, I'll believe you this time.zts19780e	I'll inform the elder about it.zts19781e	This is going to take a while. Please wait here.zts19782e	Before I tell you the result of our discussion,zts19783e	I will explain the situation to my clan.zts19784e	The elders and their followers who wanted to take revenge on the Vikings, took advice from those elders who want to investigate things first.zts19785e	Then you came.zts19786e	After a lot of arguing, they decided to give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to you.zts19787e	But first you must survive the warrior's ritual.zts19788e	That's the condition.zts19789e	The warrior's ritual?zts19790e	The Goths live in harmony with nature, and the warrior's ritual is a holy Goth tradition.zts19791e	If you survive the ritual and become a warrior, then you may meet with the Elder.zts19792e	In light of the clan's decision I will now give you a few tasks.zts19793e	The Goths believe that nature has its own representatives that look after the world.zts19794e	They are known as the legendary Bushis.zts19795e	These Bushis have different coloured fur than any other Bushis. It's said they were blessed by the elements.zts19796e	Your first task is to earn their approval.zts19797e	I wonder whether you will succeed.zts19798e	Nature's Bushis...zts19799e	Where do I even start?zts19800e	First I should ask around the village and gather information.zts19801e	Hey!zts19802e	I'm an adventurer, I explore the world.zts19803e	Do you know anything about the legendary Bushis?zts19804e	(You show her the sweets and ask her.)zts19805e	If you tell me everything you know I'll give you these.zts19806e	(The Goth girl says she doesn't know anything but she knows someone who can tell you something.)zts19807e	Okay? Give me the sweets! Sweets!zts19808e	Thanks. Here you go.zts19809e	Hey, don't eat them all at once. Otherwise you'll get cavities.zts19810e	Excuse me...zts19811e	Are you Yertirand?zts19812e	Why are you looking for me?zts19813e	(You tell him everything.)zts19814e	So you're the companion of my student?zts19815e	Then you're the one that knocked out Fafnir.zts19816e	Thanks to the Avenging Angel's help I was able to defeat Fafnir.zts19817e	I see...zts19818e	Why do you want to talk to me?zts19819e	I need your help.zts19820e	(You tell him about the task.)zts19821e	Hm, the blessed Bushis are only found in that legend.zts19822e	No one has ever come across one.zts19823e	I think the elders don't really want you getting mixed up in their affairs.zts19824e	That's why they've given you such a silly task.zts19825e	But I have to do this so I can stop a war. Is there really no answer to this problem?zts19826e	Hm... Well then you'll need to trick them.zts19827e	Please collect the required materials.zts19828e	Yertirandzts19829e	First bring me the Pure Essence of Fire and Spring Water.zts19830e	Very good, you did that well.zts19831e	Now bring me Flame Crystal Gems, Water Wave Crystal Gems and Wind Crystal Gems.zts19832e	Wonderful. Now I will make the item. While you're waiting you can make an alibi.zts19833e	Head out as though you were really searching. Go deep into the place and then come back.zts19834e	We should keep going.zts19835e	We should turn back now.zts19836e	It's done.zts19837e	The elder will noticezts19838e	that this is a fake.zts19839e	(Should we really do this? Hm, well we still need to stop this war.)zts19840e	Utegarda, I have met the legendary Bushis.zts19841e	Here's the proof.zts19842e	(Utegarda looks blank, then catches himself and begins to speak.)zts19843e	Erm, I need to discuss it with the Elder first. Please wait here.zts19844e	How surprising... Congratulations!zts19845e	Your second task is to complete the training that the warriors and mages have come up with.zts19846e	This training consists of finding spies without being spotted yourself.zts19847e	Good luck.zts19848e	This task will be easy for any talented observer.zts19849e	Let's move on to the next task.zts19850e	This time your task is to survive.zts19851e	Survive this training ground we've created with magic. This won't be easy.zts19852e	Better than I expected.zts19853e	Now let's move on to your final task.zts19854e	Using a simulated fight we will find out how well you work together with others.zts19855e	You choose one attack group and one defence group and lead them to victory.zts19856e	The stranger has mastered every task.zts19857e	Now you are a warrior.zts19858e	Congratulations!zts19859e	So am I allowed to meet with the Elder now?zts19860e	Follow me.zts19861e	Goth Elderzts19862e	Welcome, stranger.zts19863e	I am the Goth elder, you are the stranger.zts19864e	It is an honour to meet you.zts19865e	Utegarda has told me already.zts19866e	Unfortunately this information is not enough to prevent a war with the Vikings.zts19867e	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.zts19868e	They will bleed, as we have bled.zts19869e	But it's all Ragnar's fault. I don't know why he did it.zts19870e	Please, give me more time.zts19871e	I'll find the reason for this misunderstanding.zts19872e	And how are you going to do that? And who knows who you're working for?zts19873e	I don't work for anyone.zts19874e	The war hits the weak the hardest.zts19875e	That's why I'm trying to prevent this war.zts19876e	I'm not on any side, I try to stay as neutral and objective as I can while I investigate.zts19877e	Please believe me.zts19878e	I'll try to believe you.zts19879e	But only on one condition.zts19880e	(The elder turns to Utegarda and asks him to get someone.)zts19881e	(A little while later Utegarda returns with a girl in tow.)zts19882e	Did you ask for me?zts19883e	Yes. I'd like you to go with this adventurer and investigate the incident with the observers.zts19884e	This is the best marksman in the clan.zts19885e	Her name's Jennifer. You can discuss the details while you travel.zts19886e	Thank you for believing me.zts19887e	It's okay. But remember, you don't have much time.zts19888e	I can't bear the clan fighting amongst themselves.zts19889e	(Suddenly Utegarda comes into the tent and reports something.)zts19890e	Ragnar is at death's door.zts19891e	Huh? But that's good for us, isn't it?zts19892e	Yes?zts19893e	Doesn't matter. Why is that?zts19894e	Our clan's magic circle is on Ragnar's body.zts19895e	Whaaat?!zts19896e	I will find out what's happened.zts19897e	Clearly someone wants us to start a war against the Vikings.zts19898e	Please go to the Vikings with Jennifer and Yertirand and deal with what's causing this problem.zts19899e	Jenniferzts19900e	Has he gone out?zts19901e	(You look around but can't see him anywhere.)zts19902e	He'll certainly be back soon. Let's just wait.zts19903e	Strange. He's never been away for this long. We should go to the village.zts19904e	There is no trace of him.zts19905e	Let's go to his house.zts19906e	(Jennifer opens the door and goes inside.)zts19907e	(She picks up a book from the floor.)zts19908e	This book is about our clan's forbidden spell. Why is it lying here?zts19909e	The forbidden spell?zts19910e	Yes. It curses the living and removes all their strength and potential.zts19911e	It transfers it all to dead bodies and awakens them as puppets.zts19912e	And a dangerous book like this is just lying around. Which means...zts19913e	You're thinking what I'm thinking.zts19914e	We need to get to the Viking village.zts19915e	Yertirand musn't reach the village before us. Hurry!zts19916e	(To be continued.)zts19917e	My arrow never misses its target.zts19918e	I feel so empty.zts19919e	What do you want me to do?zts19920e	First Matezts19921e	Are you coming on board or not, Kku?zts19922e	It's so hot, Kkuu...zts19923e	Wandering Desert Alchemistzts19924e	Nothing in the world is free. Everything has its price.zts19925e	Desert Weapon Shopzts19926e	Welcome. What do you need?zts19927e	(Come back once you've finished hunting monsters.)zts19928e	Seems the time has come...zts19929e	Alchemist from Tart Hapendam (Alchemist)zts19930e	Quartermasterzts19931e	Apparently there's a stranger prowling around...zts19932e	Are you coming on board or not, Kku? That'll be 50,000 Gold.zts19933e	Tart Hapendam Departure timeszts19934e	Maybe next time.zts19935e	It's so hot, Kku... That'll be 50,000 Gold.zts19936e	Port Alveus Departure timeszts19941e	Jennifer, wait! If he hasn't gone to the Viking village, then we're only wasting our time.zts19942e	Hmm... We'll see.zts19943e	Let's go to the Oasis, I've got an informant there.zts19944e	There he is.zts19945e	A sand dwarf?zts19946e	What do you want?!zts19947e	How rude!zts19948e	What can I do for you?zts19949e	(You show him Yertirand's picture.)zts19950e	Have you ever seen him before?zts19951e	Yes. I saw him with a Goth guard not long ago in Tart Hapendam.zts19952e	That's one weird informer you have there.zts19953e	I'll take that as a compliment!zts19954e	Let's go back to town and look for this guard.zts19955e	There are probably lots of guards in town.zts19956e	(After much searching you finally find the guard.)zts19957e	Guardzts19958e	You're the captain of the patrol, aren't you?zts19959e	I knew you and Yertirand were in this together!zts19960e	Where did you meet him?zts19961e	How did you find out?zts19962e	He was looking for a ship to take him to Desert Eagle City.zts19963e	Why was he asking you?zts19964e	Before I became a guard, I used to be a pirate.zts19965e	I asked my old shipmates and found Yertirand a ship.zts19966e	Do you know where he's hiding in Desert Eagle City?zts19967e	Not exactly. But he was asking about some kind of merchant.zts19968e	I don't know any more than that, I swear!zts19969e	We have to get to Desert Eagle City.zts19970e	Here it is, the pearl of the desert sands - Desert Eagle City!zts19971e	Let's find this merchant.zts19972e	We should try searching the market.zts19973e	Hey! What did you trade with Yertirand?zts19974e	Who are you? Have we met?zts19975e	You should tell me what I need to know, when I ask so nicely.zts19976e	Ha! Threaten me all you like, I'm not afraid of you. Guards!zts19977e	(You quickly cover his mouth to shut him up. After he's calmed down again, you release him.)zts19978e	If you want me to tell you anything, you're going to have to pay for it.zts19979e	I want an Ice Flower.zts19980e	Alright, we have a deal.zts19981e	Here you are.zts19982e	Some time back, a Goth came calling.zts19983e	He sold me some coloured sand and then asked for information.zts19984e	He wanted to know if I knew anyone versed in spring water.zts19985e	And who did you say?zts19986e	That answer will cost you extra.zts19987e	You what? Alright, fine, how much?zts19988e	Merchantzts19989e	A mere 200,000 Gold.zts19990e	Good! I checked the amount.zts19991e	There's an alchemist hanging around the back streets of town. Go and find her.zts19992e	Backstreet Alchemistzts19993e	Have you seen this man?zts19994e	Why are you looking for him?zts19995e	He's the mage in my tribe, but he suddenly went missing. We're trying to find him again.zts19996e	I've heard that he was seen around these parts.zts19997e	Oh, I see...zts19998e	I'll tell you, if you're willing to help me first.zts19999e	I'm interested in something particular. It can be found in the Region of the Burning Sword.zts20000e	But to enter this area, I need Heat Resistance Potions. Could you get me some potions?zts20001e	Here you are. Now please, tell us what you know.zts20002e	I gave him some Spring Water, and then he left.zts20003e	Is that it?zts20004e	He asked about some other essences.zts20005e	So I introduced him to a colleague who's more knowledgeable on the subject.zts20006e	He's an alchemist who has travelled the world. He can be found near the Temple Site.zts20007e	Excuse me. Are you the Wandering Alchemist?zts20008e	Wandering Alchemistzts20009e	Who are you? What do you want?zts20010e	I'm Jennifer, a member of the Goths.zts20011e	I'm not obliged to tell you anything.zts20012e	Oh, we'll pay you of course.zts20013e	Just name your price.zts20014e	Oho! I see you're familiar with the principles of fair exchange.zts20015e	Well, my hobby is collecting medals.zts20016e	I'll give you the information if you bring me a few valuable medals.zts20017e	Here you go. Now it's your turn.zts20018e	He took some Sand Essence with him.zts20019e	And where did he go?zts20020e	Why, I don't know that. Once he had the essence, he left.zts20021e	I thought we were so close to our goal!zts20022e	But the way it looks now, we're right back to square one.zts20023e	Where should we go next?zts20024e	We've tried our best.zts20025e	Let's head back to Tart Hapendam.zts20026e	Maybe the elder can give us some advice...zts20027e	(Jennifer hands the Great Elder the book containing the forbidden magic. She explains everything you were able to learn.)zts20028e	Hmm... looks like we're in trouble.zts20029e	Now that he's gathered all the necessary materials together, he'll doubtless try to enter the Ancient Slade Tower.zts20030e	The stolen book contains forbidden spells about death and resurrection.zts20031e	Long ago, our ancestors started investigating the dark arts.zts20032e	They wanted to unlock the secrets of immortality.zts20033e	They continued their research despite a great many setbacks and huge sacrifice.zts20034e	Ultimately, their playing with dark energy resulted in catastrophe.zts20035e	The energy awoke the dragon who long had slumbered beneath the earth.zts20036e	Do you mean Fafnir?zts20037e	No. There is a dragon born of the very tears of the earth mother...zts20038e	She cried in grief because of the great war.zts20039e	This dragon is undead.zts20040e	Born of the sorrows that the great war brought about, the dragon has only one goal...zts20041e	... to wipe out all life as we know it.zts20042e	The earth mother tried to defeat him, but in vain.zts20043e	The dragon was her own creation, her own child. So she locked him away.zts20044e	Now awoken, the dragon started to kill everyone and everything in its path.zts20045e	The people feared for their lives.zts20046e	Some of the Slade tribe in the desert took it upon themselves to seal the dragon away again, for the sake of all who loved the earth mother.zts20047e	The Slades fought bravely, day and night, against the mighty dragon.zts20048e	Finally they drove him deep into the desert.zts20049e	Many Slade warriors were injured in the fight.zts20050e	Some were badly wounded.zts20051e	So they made a decision...zts20052e	... they decided to sacrifice themselves, and build a tower...zts20053e	... a tower in which to seal away the dragon.zts20054e	After much intense and bitter fighting, they were able to seal the dragon inside the tower.zts20055e	They call this prison the Ancient Slade Tower.zts20056e	You can find it in the deserts of Jotunheim.zts20057e	I think that Yertirand is trying to awaken this undead dragon.zts20058e	We cannot break this spell, even if we manage to defeat him.zts20059e	We need another spell to seal the dragon away.zts20060e	Fortunately, I am versed in the magic which the elders passed down to their descendants.zts20061e	But I'll need the help of an alchemist to cast the spell.zts20062e	Find Malcolm, the alchemist in NosVille.zts20063e	Take this parchment scroll and the materials to Malcolm so he can create the magic scroll.zts20064e	Let's get the materials together and take them to Malcolm.zts20065e	Malcolm Mix!zts20066e	Wha... what can I do for you?zts20067e	(You give Malcolm the scroll and explain everything.)zts20068e	Yes, I can create the scroll. Bu... but I'm not sure it'll be very good.zts20069e	Is that it?zts20070e	Great Elder! I bring you the scroll.zts20071e	Find the magic book and burn it! That should banish Yertirand's evil spell and prevent him from casting it again.zts20072e	This is the Ancient Slade Tower.zts20073e	Be careful!zts20074e	Okay.zts20075e	Descriptionzts20076e	(After the fierce fighting, Yertirand gets up.)zts20077e	(He stands there, unperturbed, and starts to speak.)zts20078e	I am not Yertirand, merely a part of his spirit.zts20079e	Once I was a powerful Viking mage.zts20080e	I had a student called Erdimien.zts20081e	She was very gifted with magic, so much so that I became jealous of her.zts20082e	My jealousy only continued to grow, and I became ashamed of myself.zts20083e	At the same time I was very proud of Erdimien and her abilities.zts20084e	It didn't take long before her magical powers surpassed mine.zts20085e	As her mentor, I was of course very pleased, but as a mage I was ashamed.zts20086e	When the dragon Fafnir came and attacked the village one day...zts20087e	... I seized the chance and faked my death.zts20088e	I hid in the Gothic town of Tart Hapendam, where my mother came from.zts20089e	While laying low in the library, I came across an interesting book.zts20090e	It was full of forbidden spells about death and darkness.zts20091e	I studied the magic in those pages.zts20092e	Some of the spells I could use for my own purposes.zts20093e	I cast a spell on Ragnar, the mighty Viking hero.zts20094e	He did not turn to the undead...zts20095e	... but he followed my commands!zts20096e	What an amazing spell!zts20097e	It placed the hero completely under my control.zts20098e	It wasn't long before an obsession grew...zts20099e	The darkness took me!zts20100e	That's how a second ego was born.zts20101e	An ego thirsty for power, an ego which hated all life.zts20102e	After the evil ego had taken control of my body...zts20103e	... I saw the error of my ways.zts20104e	I had been a fool.zts20105e	This is all my fault. I hope you can correct my terrible mistakes.zts20106e	(Yertirand disappears into thin air.)zts20107e	Twisted Yertirandzts20108e	(After some time, Yertirand's alter ego appears, shrouded in dark energy.)zts20109e	Haha! Who is this?zts20110e	Visitors!zts20111e	Excellent! Hahaha!zts20112e	With your help I can take full control of this body.zts20113e	The whole world will kneel before me!zts20114e	(This Yertirand, shrouded in dark energy, laughs evilly and disappears without a trace.)zts20115e	Quick! We have to stop him before he can cast the spell!zts20116e	Wait a second...zts20117e	Power that doesn't belong to us carries a terrible price.zts20118e	May Yertirand rest in peace.zts20119e	You succeeded!zts20120e	That was some hard work you put in.zts20121e	How can I repay you?zts20122e	I want the Goths and Vikings to get along with one another from now on.zts20123e	Fine. We'll try.zts20124e	Oh! While you were away, a young Viking called Barni came by.zts20125e	He asked me to tell you to go to NosVillezts20126e	Barni?zts20127e	Okay, understood. Thank you!zts20128e	Thanks for your hard work.zts20129e	(Jennifer tips her hat in farewell and nods with a smile.)zts20130e	Farewell.zts20131e	Barni...zts20132e	Viking Barnizts20133e	Long time no see!zts20134e	Thanks to your help, my family have been able to enter Valhalla.zts20135e	I'll never forget this!zts20136e	(Barni's body shines in a blinding light and then slowly fades away.)zts20137e	It's time to say goodbye for good. Thank you for everything you've done. Farewell.zts20138e	Farewell. Give my greetings to your family.zts20139e	(The light disappears and you are left all alone.)zts20140e	Well then... I guess I'll go and find someone who needs my help.zts20141e	No problem!zts20142e	I've got everything you wish for!zts20143e	Pass the tests and search for the truth...zts20144e	I'm looking for the Stone of the Wise Man.zts20145e	Twisted Yertirand (Start PvP)zts20146e	Let's play a little game. It's your choice - live or die!zts20147e	Twisted Yertirand (PvP Victory)zts20148e	Congratulations, you're still alive! Most people don't appreciate what it means to be alive. Now you've learnt to enjoy it.zts20149e	Twisted Yertirand (Time Up)zts20150e	I've never killed anyone in my life. They wanted it that way!zts20152e	10th Anniversary Eventzts20153e	NosTale's celebrating its 10th anniversary and it's all thanks to with! *applause*zts20154e	That's why we have the best present ever for our 10th anniversary!zts20155e	If you bring me the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 10, I'll transform them into your gift.zts20156e	Exchange for 10th Anniversary Medalzts20157e	Exchange for 10th Anniversary Buffzts20158e	The 10th Anniversary Medal has many shop item functions.zts20159e	You need all the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 10. Do you want to exchange them?zts20160e	The 10th Anniversary Buff increases your maximum HP and MP for 3,200 seconds.zts20161e	You need the letters Y, E, A, R plus the number 10. Do you want to receive the buff?zts20168e	10th Anniversary Giftzts20169e	Here's a gift which should remind dauntless Swordsmen like yourself of the 10th anniversary! Have fun with it, haha!zts20170e	This sword...zts20171e	... this truly legendary sword can cut through any armour!zts20172e	And you can certainly cut through a cake with it too!zts20173e	How about a little gamble?zts20174e	Hehehe!zts20175e	You only live once!zts20176e	Happy 10th anniversary!

(You find the book.)zts20258e	Ah, here's something: 'Mastering Martial Arts'!zts20259e	The term 'martial arts' includes all different kinds of offensive and defensive techniques.zts20260e	You use both weapons and your own body in close quarters combat.zts20261e	Hmm...zts20262e	All the different styles of martial arts have their own particularities.zts20263e	But then they're also very similar, as they focus on the same body parts.zts20264e	There are many different paths.zts20265e	Nevertheless, they all pursue the same goal of becoming better and stronger.zts20266e	The main principles are hence virtually identical.zts20267e	Really?zts20268e	When two individuals fight a duel, it's very similar to what martial arts are.zts20269e	But the main focus of martial arts lies in honing your skills.zts20270e	In duelling on the other hand it's all about winning, according to the rules.zts20271e	Yadda yadda yadda.zts20272e	This book is pretty tough going.zts20273e	Today there are still martial arts masters around, Jerico and Tei Ken.zts20274e	The two of them are very talented and have perfected their martial arts.zts20275e	Hmm... I should probably find Jerico and have him teach me.zts20276e	Oh! Nice to meet you. So you're interested in learning about martial arts?zts20277e	Yes, I want to learn more about them.zts20278e	The principles of martial arts are simple, but profound.zts20279e	If you hold to the principles, you'll master any challenge that comes your way.zts20280e	When learning basic martial arts, we always begin with the Training Stake.zts20281e	*huff* *pant*zts20282e	With martial arts, there's no such thing as enough training.zts20283e	The principles are extremely important, never forget that.zts20284e	Again!zts20285e	Oof, it's so tiring... and boring.zts20286e	Good! You've done well.zts20287e	Keep up the good work.zts20288e	Now for some real training. This opponent isn't particularly strong, but keep your wits about you.zts20289e	Err? That was easier than I thought.zts20290e	Well you've grasped the basics now, of course it was easy.zts20291e	But don't let that go to your head. Not all opponents will be such a walkover.zts20292e	(You're lost in thought.)zts20293e	If you remember your training, you'll be able to defeat any opponent.zts20294e	If you want to learn more advanced skills, pay a visit to Tei Ken in the Team Arena.zts20295e	You can learn more about the various skills from him there.zts20296e	Tei Ken...zts20297e	Well? What of it, you amateurs? Do you want to prove yourselves in the Arena of Talents? Haha!zts20298e	Oh, you're different from the others. You've clearly learned some martial arts.zts20299e	That's something of a rarity. Say, do you want to become my pupil?zts20300e	No, thanks. I want to become a martial artist just as great as you are.zts20301e	Haha, good! Plucky. I like that.zts20302e	You're very ambitious! Just how a martial artist ought to be.zts20303e	What do you want to learn then?zts20304e	I would like to learn more complicated things than the skills I already have.zts20305e	Hmm... let me see then...zts20306e	All martial arts build upon the physical body.zts20307e	If you want to learn how to use your hands and arms more effectively, visit the skill master in NosVille.zts20308e	If you prefer techniques relating to your feet and legs, then talk to the skill master in Port Alveus.zts20309e	And you can learn about invisible forces by visiting NosCamp Cave.zts20310e	Oh, that's very useful information. Thank you!zts20311e	I'll set off at once! Goodbye...zts20312e	Wait, that's not all.zts20313e	You must reach the right state of mind for each skill. Take your training step by step.zts20314e	And one more thing.zts20315e	Do you know the old masters who became famous for their martial arts?zts20316e	The old masters?zts20317e	Yes, the old masters. There were once four martial arts masters.zts20318e	For most people they have already faded from memory, but we martial artists don't forget our heroes.zts20319e	You can still read about their lives in Lord Cuarry's Library.zts20320e	Aww noooo! I hate books!zts20321e	Well fine... the old martial arts masters...zts20322e	(You see the sentence 'Put the book back once you've finished reading it.')zts20323e	What book is that?zts20324e	'The Cursed Clown' - author unknownzts20325e	Many years ago, there lived a popular clown.zts20326e	He was very proud of his ability to make people laugh.zts20327e	But he wanted to make the people laugh longer and harder, and his jokes became more excessive and rude.zts20328e	People didn't like his indecent jokes, so they turned him away.zts20329e	The clown tried to use magic to regain his old reputation.zts20330e	But unfortunately the magic he used was black magic.zts20331e	Hmm. Looks like this is the wrong book.zts20332e	(You discover a well worn book.)zts20333e	'The Truth Story of the War of the Gods' - author unknownzts20334e	Angels and demons: when did their conflict begin? And why?zts20335e	We have investigated the true story behind events.zts20336e	(The book continues...)zts20337e	We wanted to write the truth in this book, but we were unable.zts20338e	Doing so would have been dangerous to us.zts20339e	But anyone who finds us can learn the full truth.zts20340e	That's not the right book either.zts20341e	'Capturing Made Easy' - a Beast Masterzts20342e	All kinds of different creatures can be captured, everything from sheep and chickens right through to terrifying monsters.zts20343e	The simplest way to capture a creature is...zts20344e	(You notice a very old book.)zts20345e	'The History of the Forgotten Masters' - author unknownzts20346e	Eureka! This is it!zts20347e	(You open the book. It has four chapters, but three of them are blank.)zts20348e	Hmm... that's strange.zts20349e	Why are these chapters blank? Is it incomplete?zts20350e	'The History of the Forgotten Masters'zts20351e	On the first master, Draconic Fist, the Hero of Firezts20352e	Draconic Fist is a powerful master who commanded the flames.zts20353e	His strength comes from a bestial arm, an arm which glows red when summoning the flames.zts20354e	Although part of his body is large and grotesque, he can move with immense agility.zts20355e	And nobody can withstand the power of the flames.zts20356e	This seemingly barbaric creature is in reality almost childishly pure.zts20357e	The story describes how Draconic Fist challenged the ancient gods.zts20358e	Dragon Fist journeyed far and wide with the other masters to discover the origins of the War of the Gods.zts20359e	(The book continues...)zts20360e	They were last seen in the Misty Forest below Stone Cliff. And then... never again.zts20361e	Misty Forest? War of the Gods?zts20362e	Where is the Misty Forest? And what is the War of the Gods? I've heard that somewhere before.zts20363e	I need to find this forest.zts20364e	I didn't realise there was a forest like that around here.zts20365e	It's so misty here. I can barely see anything.zts20366e	This is a restricted area. I will punish you for trespassing.zts20367e	Excuse me? What's an angel doing here?zts20368e	Why?! I don't understand why that angel is here.zts20369e	I don't think I stand a chance against an angel...zts20370e	But I have to continue, despite the dangers.zts20371e	Hehe, a human here, and after such a long time. I'll get you! Mwahaha.zts20372e	Was that a demon?zts20373e	It's so dangerous!zts20374e	I have to get out of here.zts20375e	Just what are the angel and demon guarding here?zts20376e	Wait a second... the War of the Gods had something to do with angels and demons.zts20377e	That's right, the war was fought between angels and demons.zts20378e	But why are both claiming the other is intruding?zts20379e	What was Draconic Fist looking for in this forest?zts20380e	Wuhaa!zts20381e	What was that?zts20382e	That was neither angel nor demon!zts20383e	Looks like it's going to attack me...zts20384e	*wheeze*zts20385e	That was a close one! What sort of attack was that?zts20386e	Hmm? There's someone up ahead.zts20387e	Haha! I'm back! Yeah!zts20388e	Who are you?zts20389e	Oh. You saved me!zts20390e	Did you see a kind of puppet which looked like me?zts20391e	Ah! I defeated a puppet which attacked me.zts20392e	First of all, let me thank you for your help. Now where are my friends?zts20393e	And the world! How is the world? Are Zenas and Erenia still the same?zts20394e	Oh my god! I can't believe it!zts20395e	The enemy of the flame has vanished. Then Zenas and Erenia must still be suffering.zts20396e	I simply don't have the time. What should I do, what should I do, what should I do?zts20397e	Hey, please... calm down!zts20398e	I can't! After centuries I've finally gotten away! Oh, right. You're right.zts20399e	I need to calm down. She wouldn't like it if I were to lose my composure.zts20400e	Buh, just the thought of her makes me nervous. I don't like her, but I'm very lonely.zts20401e	Excuse me, but... well, who are you? What are you doing here? And who are the angel and demon outside?zts20402e	You don't know who I am? Oh no!zts20403e	(He suddenly assumes a strange pose.)zts20404e	Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the hottest of hot! The greatest of the great! The man of flames! I am Draconic Fist! Err... is this the right pose?zts20405e	Ahem... anyway, I think there are angels and demons all over this place.zts20406e	You should keep an eye out for them!zts20407e	Especially for Zenas and Erenia. They're behind everything. They swore to...zts20408e	?!?zts20409e	Oh no! I'm disappearing! There's no time. I have a lot of work to do...zts20410e	Hey! Your body's disappearing in the smoke.zts20411e	Time is running from us.zts20412e	Quickly, find my friends! Once you've found us all, we can be freed completely. And you need to find out the truth.zts20413e	Who are they? And what is the truth? Tell me!zts20414e	The book! Find the book containing the Masters' Memories. It explains our stories.zts20415e	Listen. Can you hear me?zts20416e	What? I can't understand you!zts20417e	Oh no... I'm disappearing... the seal hasn't been broken...zts20418e	I will give you the Haetae Energy, so you can find my friends... please use it... to find them...zts20419e	!!!zts20420e	(He disappears, leaving behind only white smoke.)zts20421e	Oh! What just happened?zts20423e	Hello, I'm a guard from Tart Hapendam.zts20424e	For centuries we Goths have been fighting against evil sorcerers, ancient dragons and other wicked adversaries.zts20425e	In order to survive, we had to develop effective fighting techniques.zts20426e	Our martial arts are particularly useful for young adventurers.zts20427e	That's why our guards travel the world to train adventurers in our ways.zts20429e	Tart Hapendam's Martial Artszts20430e	Adventurers between levels 1 and 80 can learn the ways of Tart Hapendam's martial arts.zts20431e	All Adventurers between levels 1 and 80 can learn the ways of Tart Hapendam's martial arts.zts20435e	11th Anniversary Eventzts20436e	NosTale's celebrating its 11th anniversary and it's all thanks to with! *applause*zts20437e	That's why we have the best present ever for our 11th anniversary!zts20438e	If you bring me the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 11, I'll transform them into your gift.zts20439e	Exchange for 11th Anniversary Medalzts20440e	Exchange for 11th Anniversary Buffzts20441e	The 11th Anniversary Medal has many shop item functions.zts20442e	You need all the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 11. Do you want to exchange them?zts20443e	The 11th Anniversary Buff increases your maximum HP and MP for 3,200 seconds.zts20444e	You need the letters Y, E, A, R plus the number 11. Do you want to receive the buff?zts20449e	Receive a Red-nosed Reindeer as a gift.zts20450e	Build the Sleigh with Red-nosed Reindeer.zts20451e	Why don't you add a Red-nosed Reindeer to your Magic Sleigh?zts20452e	To produce a Magic Sleigh with Red-nosed Reindeer, you need a Red-nosed Reindeer Bead.zts20453e	Build the Magic Sleigh with Red-nosed Reindeer.zts20454e	Have you ever heard of the Red-nosed Reindeer?zts20455e	A sleigh pulled by a Red-nosed Reindeer outpaces all other sleighs with ease. It's also much safer.zts20456e	If you eliminate the fiends making life difficult for us this winter, I'll give you the Red-nosed Reindeer.zts20457e	Well-behaved children deserve great gifts, hohoho!zts20458e	Okay, I'll destroy those fiends.zts20459e	Martial Artist - The Water Heroinezts20460e	So, you have gained the power of the master. You will be the envy of the other martial artists.zts20461e	I only have you to thank for that.zts20462e	I just taught you the basics. Hmm, I should train more myself.zts20463e	Now... where are you going?zts20464e	Hmm? I wanted to go back to the library.zts20465e	I just can't get the master's final words out of my head...zts20466e	New Informationzts20467e	I've found the book 'The History of the Forgotten Masters'.zts20468e	(You open the book. It says: 'Chapter 2 of 4'.)zts20469e	Oh! The pages were blank before, but now I can read the second chapter!zts20470e	How strange...zts20471e	'On the Second Master, Mystic Arts, the Water Heroine.zts20472e	The world has forgotten her, but this book will tell you all about her.zts20473e	They were strangers from the East, curious figures. They possessed mysterious skills and while Draconic Fist flaunted his strength, Mystic Arts radiated calm and prudence.zts20474e	But woe betide anyone who provoked her!zts20475e	She confounded her opponents' senses by summoning ornate floral patterns in the air, and then struck them down with lightning-fast, powerful attacks.zts20476e	The martial art of this master was at the same time beautiful and deadly.zts20477e	She saw the strength and the beauty of the martial art and deemed the techniques of Draconic Fist crude and barbaric.zts20478e	This incensed Draconic Fist, but he didn't let it show. Thus, discord sprouted between the two masters.zts20479e	According to legend, a large mountain comes into view when you cross the Misty Forest and then follow the side road. It is said that is where they are to be found.zts20480e	But until now, no one has seen Mystic Arts.'zts20481e	Mystic Arts? So that's the name of the second master?zts20482e	Draconic Fist tasked me with finding his friends.zts20483e	Mystic Arts is the second master. Hmm, and the book has four chapters...zts20484e	Ah, of course! There must be four masters in total!zts20485e	So, the third chapter is sure to appear when I find Mystic Arts!zts20486e	Hmm...zts20487e	(You leaf through the book.)zts20488e	Wait a second! There's something on the last pages...zts20489e	'Before times eternal, when light and darkness were still one, there lived a being, Ego, that possessed both powers.zts20490e	In those days, humans suffered under the bondage of the demons and prayed for salvation.zts20491e	Ego noticed that when the powers of light gained strength, darkness became weaker.zts20492e	When the humans were not plagued by the demons, they fought amongst themselves.zts20493e	Thus, there was constant war.zts20494e	Then there were times when the power of light was dwindling as the darkness grew stronger.zts20495e	Ego thought long and hard about it:zts20496e	"When the light grows stronger, darkness wanes. And when the power of darkness grows, the light fades.zts20497e	I exist in both powers. An imbalance would therefore be my end.zts20498e	So, I must ensure that the powers are in balance as I do not want to pass away."zts20499e	And with those words, the two powers were separated.'zts20500e	And then... Hmm? The next page is completely blank!zts20501e	So, light and darkness used to be one... But who or what is Ego?zts20502e	These lines weren't here before. Who wrote them?zts20503e	Hmm, first I need to find Mystic Arts. I should ask Tei Ken.zts20504e	Hello! I've already met one of the masters: Draconic Fist.zts20505e	Really? You've met the legendary martial artist?zts20506e	He's one of the most powerful warriors of all time. What was he like? What did he say?zts20507e	Ah, we only spoke briefly as he's still sealed.zts20508e	He asked me to find the other masters. I've got a clue already.zts20509e	Oh, wonderful! That's fantastic!zts20510e	No one's been able to find them, but you're on their trail! It must be your destiny to find the masters.zts20511e	Yes, my destiny...zts20512e	(Tei Ken takes something out of his pocket.)zts20513e	Here, my tutor gave me this when I was young.zts20514e	I don't know what it's for, but I've carried it with me ever since.zts20515e	My tutor said that it was a Mark of the Old Masters, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on me.zts20516e	Perhaps it'll help you to find the masters.zts20517e	That's...zts20518e	As I said, I don't know what it is, but I sense that it has something to do with the masters.zts20519e	Seek out the old masters and report what you find out to me.zts20520e	It would be a great honour for me if you were to find the legendary martial artists.zts20521e	(Hmm, so this is the Misty Forest.)zts20522e	(There was something about a Misty Forest in the book. Now I just have to find it.)zts20523e	(Here are the angels I met in the Cave of Memory.)zts20524e	(I need to defeat the Guardians.)zts20525e	(There's the side road!)zts20526e	(Hmm, I almost missed it. Right then, let's go!)zts20527e	(I'll get lost if I'm not careful. I need to concentrate.)zts20528e	There are angels... and demons with spears?! They're fighting together? Strange...)zts20529e	(Phew, that was intense. Get out of here quickly!)zts20530e	(That sounds like a waterfall. I need to find it.)zts20531e	(Ah, a hidden path!)zts20532e	(Seems no one has used it for a long time. I must almost be there.)zts20533e	(Hmm, the place I've been looking for should be here.)zts20534e	(It's so quiet. Really eerie...)zts20535e	(I hear something. But I don't know where it's coming from.)zts20536e	Do you serve the angels or the demons?zts20537e	I serve no one!zts20538e	Neither angels nor demons dare to come to this place. And certainly not humans. You are a fool!zts20539e	That's big talk for someone who's too cowardly to show themselves.zts20540e	Are you trying to provoke me? Come and find me in the moonlight.zts20541e	All right. This'll be a piece of cake!zts20542e	You actually found me.zts20543e	(Uh... That was just pure coincidence.)zts20544e	We should introduce ourselves. I am Mystic Arts.zts20545e	Pleased to meet you. I'm an adventurer who came across the story of the masters by chance.zts20546e	Very well. You are my guest, so enter.zts20547e	Thanks for the invitation.zts20548e	Wow, what a great temple! Those who train here must obtain unimagined powers.zts20549e	Speaking of which... it seems you have not come here to train. What brings you here?zts20550e	As I said, I learned about the masters by pure chance during my training.zts20551e	And then I met Draconic Fist.zts20552e	What? You've met Draconic Fist?zts20553e	Yes, he's got a really fiery temperament. He misses you, by the way.zts20554e	Bah, the feeling's not mutual... How's he doing?zts20555e	He asked me to search for the others and tell them the truth. Then he vanished into white smoke.zts20556e	You just don't give up, Draconic Fist...zts20557e	You do seem to miss him a bit...zts20558e	No, I don't! I'd just like to pit myself against him again, just like old times.zts20559e	Well, I can help you there.zts20560e	Really? How?zts20561e	Before he disappeared, he granted me his powers.zts20562e	So, you can pit yourself against Draconic Fist's powers if you like. I'm curious to know what skills you have.zts20563e	With pleasure! Transform into Draconic Fist then.zts20564e	Thank you. I've not had such a good battle in a long time. Perhaps you'll actually manage to free us all.zts20565e	I will do everything in my power.zts20566e	Good... Oh, the moon is giving way to the sun. My time is running out.zts20567e	What? Are you going to disappear as well?zts20568e	When the moon hides its face, I too must go. But I have something to tell you first.zts20569e	I'm listening.zts20570e	You've already freed me and Draconic Fist, but you must find the others as well.zts20571e	Then everyone will finally know the truth.zts20572e	Of course! I will find them all. Erm... Any chance you know where the third master is?zts20573e	Well, while we were fighting, I saw that you are wearing the Mark of the Masters. This mark is the key.zts20574e	So, the mark is the key, huh? Tei Ken gave it to me and said that I would find the masters with it.zts20575e	That's right. The mark will show you the way.zts20576e	My time is up. Thank you. May the Masters' Blessing be with you.zts20577e	Oh, how beautiful. It almost looked as if she melted into the moonlight. (To be continued...)zts20578e	Amora's Storyzts20579e	Hello, Amora! It is an honour to meet you.zts20580e	Oh, hello!zts20581e	I'd like to ask you something... Will I ever find true love?zts20582e	Love? Love isn't beautiful or fulfilling. Love is cruel!zts20583e	I'm confused. You are an angel of love, aren't you?zts20584e	*grumble* Leave me alone!zts20585e	What's troubling you?zts20586e	Bah... I'm not telling you. No one will help me anyway.zts20587e	Why are you so stubborn?zts20588e	I really do want to help you.zts20589e	Hmm, would you do me a favour then? But I'm not telling you my story, got it?zts20590e	Okay, I just want to cheer you up. What can I do for you?zts20591e	Thanks for your warm words.zts20592e	The NosVille army is camped in the NosVille Meadows. Some soldiers set out from there today.zts20593e	Could you find out what they're up to? Perhaps someone in the army knows.zts20594e	I'm on it. I'll be back soon.zts20595e	Hello, Commander Ray Ramos.zts20596e	Oh, adventurer! Great to see you. What brings you here?zts20597e	I've heard that some soldiers set out this morning. Is that true?zts20598e	That's true. But their mission is strictly confidential, so I can't talk about it. Why are you asking?zts20599e	Well, maybe someone's looking for them.zts20600e	And who would that be?zts20601e	Ahhh, that... was just speculations.zts20602e	Hmm, mysterious. Perhaps I can give you a few details.zts20603e	But only if you do me a favour.zts20604e	Of course. What do you want me to do?zts20605e	The monsters in the Fernon Temple are causing us major problems. Would you destroy them for us?zts20606e	Of course! I'll return as soon as the mission is complete.zts20607e	Done, Commander!zts20608e	Excellent! I would like to offer you a position in my army as an officer.zts20609e	I'm afraid I'll have to turn down your offer. I've already got my hands full.zts20610e	Your decision saddens me as you have some really outstanding skills.zts20611e	Would you now fulfil your part of the bargain and tell me where the soldiers went?zts20612e	Ah, of course! A few days ago, we discovered a new Time-Space. I dispatched them to explore it.zts20613e	That sounds rather dangerous. Can I help, perhaps?zts20614e	Your skills will be of great use. The Time-Space is located in the northern meadows.zts20615e	The commanding officer's name is Chris. He'll be easy to recognise as he's wearing the same uniform as me.zts20616e	Understood. I will cooperate with him. But I'm making a detour to NosVille first.zts20617e	Thank you! And good luck!zts20618e	Hey, adventurer! Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?zts20619e	Calm down! I know now where the soldiers are.zts20620e	Where? Is it far from here?zts20621e	How come you're so interested?zts20622e	Out with it! Is it nearby?zts20623e	Yes, they're in the NosVille Meadows.zts20624e	That's just around the corner, thank goodness! Uh, why have they gone there anyway?zts20625e	Are you finally going to tell me why you're so interested in the soldiers?zts20626e	That's my business. Tell me, what are they up to?zts20627e	They are inspecting a new Time-Space.zts20628e	I'm supporting Officer Chris, the leader of the mission.zts20629e	Do you know him? (She blushes.)zts20630e	This Chris is a really special guy, huh? (You wink at her and smile knowingly.)zts20631e	What's that supposed to mean? (She blushes even more.) Didn't you want to go and help them? You'd better hurry!zts20632e	All right, I'm on my way.zts20633e	Thanks, adventurer. Good luck in the Time-Space!zts20634e	I'll bring him back for sure.zts20635e	(... and she blushes even more.)zts20636e	Help! Help me!zts20637e	Are you okay? What happened?zts20638e	There's a demon raging in this Time-Space that I've never seen before.zts20639e	Are the other soldiers still in there? Where's Officer Chris?zts20640e	He's in the Time-Space, securing our escape route.zts20641e	Chris is surely in danger!zts20642e	Please rescue him, brave adventurer!zts20643e	Let's save him together, adventurer.zts20644e	Amora? What are you doing here?zts20645e	That's not important. We have to rescue Chris!zts20646e	You really are worried about him.zts20647e	No time to explain! Come on, we must hurry!zts20648e	Okay, let's get started!zts20649e	Argh... Officer... Ch... Chris....zts20650e	Where's Chris? Is he okay?zts20651e	The demon abducted him. We've tried our best, but we couldn't save him.zts20652e	Did he kidnap Chris to create a new demon?zts20653e	Oh no... my love...zts20654e	What? You love a human?zts20655e	Yes, I love Chris. But he doesn't know anything about it. He doesn't even know me!zts20656e	So this love is one-sided. But you can make everyone love.zts20657e	My job is to help people fall in love. But if I enter into a relationship with a human, I'll lose my wings and become mortal.zts20658e	Amora, you have to make sacrifices for love. You would surely be happier as a mortal who experiences true love. Do you want to regret it for the rest of your life that you didn't dare to take this step?zts20659e	I'm sure you're right. But I just don't have the courage.zts20660e	It's not too late. Confess your love for him once we've rescued him.zts20661e	Yes, I should do that. Thank you! You're right, love requires sacrifice... and courage!zts20662e	Let's rescue him quickly then, before it's too late!zts20663e	I will muster up all my courage and talk to Chris.zts20664e	*snigger* You fools! Do you really want to die?zts20665e	You filthy demon! Tell us where Chris is now!zts20666e	Mwahahaha, do you mean this wretched officer? He will make a nasty demon, hehe.zts20667e	He will resist you. You will never have him!zts20668e	You are dreaming! His courage was born of evil. He just didn't admit it.zts20669e	Chris is in great danger!zts20670e	Don't worry, you won't have to watch it. I will kill you before I transform him.zts20671e	I won't let that happen! I will strike you down with my power!zts20672e	To hell with you!zts20673e	Oh, Chris!zts20674e	Why... Why am I so angry? Argh!zts20675e	You are under the influence of the demon, Chris. Resist it!zts20676e	The whole world is full of pain. Everyone is suffering. The source of all pain is evil, so it rules the world. Mwhahaha!zts20677e	No, Chris. You are the light of righteousness! Fight back against evil!zts20678e	Righteousness is strength. And evil is also strength. So evil is righteousness!zts20679e	Amora, show him the power of true love.zts20680e	The power of love? Bah! You are so naive. Love does not last forever. It is only a fleeting desire... greed... lust!zts20681e	No, love isn't like that, Chris. Love requires sacrifice and courage. I will prove it to you!zts20682e	I love you. I have for a long time. I would give up everything for you!zts20683e	(Amora's wings vanish. She is now human.)zts20684e	Oh, Amora... You look so different...)zts20685e	What are you talking about? What's wrong? (He looks around nervously.)zts20686e	She has confessed her love for you and lost all her abilities in doing so.zts20687e	Chris, please come to!zts20688e	I fell in love with you a long time ago. With your eyes that twinkle like stars, with your deep voice, your rough hands, your silky hair, your lips and your iron will. I love everything about you.zts20689e	Why did you never tell me, Amora? (He seems to be in control of his senses again, but the demon's curse has really taken its toll on him.)zts20690e	No, I won't let you go!zts20691e	I also wish I had confessed my love to you earlier. You... are so... beautiful.zts20692e	My Chris...zts20693e	I love you, Amora. Now I'm happy... and sad at the same time...zts20694e	(Chris closes his eyes. He is dead.)zts20695e	I will not grieve for you, Chris. I will carry your love in my heart, always.zts20696e	I am so sorry, Amora! What will you do now?zts20697e	Can I join you? I will hunt demons with Chris's love in my heart.zts20698e	Whether as an angel or human: you're always welcome.zts20699e	Could you do me a favour? A New Year Lucky Pig has stolen the Gift Bags and Lucky Charms I was planning to give to my neighbours.zts20700e	Could you keep a look out for the Stolen Gift Bags and Lucky Charms on your travels?zts20701e	Where will I find the New Year Lucky Pig?zts20702e	You'll find the New Year Lucky Pig while hunting monsters within your level range.zts20703e	But you'll have to be quick! The pig won't hang around to fight when it sees you, it will simply run away!zts20704e	If you bring me 5 Stolen Gift Bags and 5 Stolen Lucky Charms, I'll give you a New Year's Gift Box.zts20705e	Cleansing the Eggs (Event)zts20706e	Hello <pname>. Have you heard the news? The Mad March Hare has entered into a pact with a demon, and given him all the eggs from the Chicken Farm.zts20707e	The demon has already handed out the eggs to other monsters! We have to get the eggs back. But some of them will doubtless have turned rotten.zts20708e	Fortunately I know how to cleanse rotten eggs! If you bring me 10 Rotten Eggs and a Soul Gem Refiner, I'll be able to cleanse them!zts20709e	Cleanse Rotten Eggszts20710e	Gathering Ingredients for the Cake (Easter Event)zts20711e	Hello adventurer.zts20712e	Have you heard? The March Hare has occupied Lord Cuarry's Chicken Farm!zts20713e	The last time the March Hare came to my shop, he was really upset.zts20714e	He said that nobody ever paid him any attention except at Easter time. He looked really downcast.zts20715e	That's our fault, we should be nice to him all year round, not just at Easter!zts20716e	Anyway, I've been given the task of baking the cake for Easter. But I don't have enough eggs.zts20717e	Plus there are some other ingredients I need. Do you think you could bring me the eggs?zts20718e	I heard that the alchemist can cleanse rotten eggs.zts20719e	If you bring me 10 Cleansed Eggs, I'll give you three slices of Easter cake.zts20720e	My cake is famous throughout NosVille for its amazing taste!zts20721e	Just a moment...zts20722e	Not Enough Ingredients! (Easter Event)zts20723e	I always wanted to make Easter decorations out of eggs and then sell them. Guess that won't happen now.zts20724e	The March Hare always used to be so nice, I can't believe how mean he has become. Maybe he's being manipulated by the demon.zts20725e	We should help him become his former self.zts20726e	Easter decorations are really important you know! If you can bring me 10 Cleansed Eggs, I'll give you an Egg-Shaped Chest.zts20727e	Just don't try to eat it, haha!zts20728e	Story of the March Hare (Easter Event)zts20729e	Are you curious to find out why the March Hare went mad? Okay, if you bring a slice of Easter cake, I'll tell you!zts20730e	Wow, you've brought me the cake! That's pretty hard to come by these days. Well, as I promised, I'll tell you what I know.zts20731e	A few days ago I was meant to repair the roof of the barn down on the Chicken Farm. So I set to work straight after lunch.zts20732e	It took me longer than I expected to do the repairs, and I wasn't finished until nearly sundown.zts20733e	After all that hard work, I needed a good rest.zts20734e	That's when I spotted a bail of hay, all dry and inviting!zts20735e	I lay down for forty winks, and when I woke up it was pitch black.zts20736e	I was just about to head for home when I heard a voice outside.zts20737e	It was the March Hare. He was standing outside together with someone I couldn't recognise. I could only make out their silhouettes.zts20738e	March Hare: How can they treat me like that? They only ever care about me at Easter, the rest of the year they completely ignore!zts20739e	Shadow: That's what people are like. They only pay attention to you when they want something. Once they've got what they want, they drop you and move on.zts20740e	March Hare: I want to ruin their Easter! That'll teach them!zts20741e	Shadow: An excellent plan. If you ruin their Easter celebrations, the people will pay more attention to you.zts20742e	March Hare: But how can I ruin their celebrations? I'm only one little hare.zts20743e	Shadow: You can do it, your spirit is strong!zts20744e	March Hare: You're right! I must be strong and ruin their Easter. Then they won't be able to ignore me any more!zts20745e	Shadow: I see what you have to do. Let me give you the power to do it. Bring me all the eggs you can find in NosVille.zts20746e	March Hare: When I'm a supervillain, then everyone will cower before me! I'll occupy the Chicken Farm and bring you all the eggs.zts20747e	Shadow: Excellent! You're going to be the meanest meanie in all of NosVille! Mwahaha!zts20748e	Then the shadow disappeared in a puff of smoke and a sardonic chortle.zts20749e	The March Hare transformed on the instant as well, and was a terrible sight to behold!zts20750e	It was all I could do to get away from the Chicken Farm.zts20751e	Even though the March Hare has turned evil, I can understand where he's coming from.zts20752e	Please help him to become the sweet little bunny he once was!zts20753e	When he's back to his usual self, I'll spend more time with him, promise!zts20754e	Speaking of which... I haven't spoken to my brother in far too long! I should probably pay him a visit.zts20755e	And why don't you say 'hi' to a few friends you haven't seen for a while?zts20756e	They'll be really pleased to hear from you!zts20757e	Good friends are never angry when you don't have time for them for a while.zts20758e	Well, that's all from me. Happy Easter!zts20759e	And thanks for the cake! Bye!zts20760e	You cannot enter Lord Cuarry's Chicken Farm at the moment. It's being occupied by the Mad March Hare.zts20761e	The Mad March Hare has stolen all the Easter eggs!zts20762e	Lord Cuarry's Knights are trying to defeat the March Hare.zts20763e	We're looking for valiant adventurers to help us.zts20764e	Please aid us so we can celebrate Easter in NosVille properly!zts20765e	[Benito Butler, Lord Cuarry's Faithful Servant]zts20766e	A Special Energyzts20767e	- The Martial Artist: Hero of the Light -zts20768e	Hello there. What can I do for you?zts20769e	Hey, there's something I wanted to ask you.zts20770e	Sorry, I don't give credit.zts20771e	Oh no, it's not about that. Can you tell me what this is?zts20772e	That? I suppose you're going to tell me it just fell into your lap, huh?zts20773e	What do you take me for?!zts20774e	Haha, calm down, I'm only pulling your leg.zts20775e	Very funny. Well, could you take a look at it? *You show her the Mark of the Old Masters.*zts20776e	Wow, quite extraordinary!zts20777e	Can you tell me anything about it? You usually know about things like this.zts20778e	I'm afraid there's nothing more I can say.zts20779e	Try asking Malcolm Mix.zts20780e	I'm sure he'll be able to tell you more.zts20781e	Oh, come on, there's something you're not telling me.zts20782e	Well... I feel like this mark is... radiating something.zts20783e	But I don't know what exactly, it's beyond my knowledge.zts20784e	Okay, well thanks for your help. Guess I'll pay Malcolm a visit.zts20785e	What, without buying anything? What about this pretty little ring? Just in this week!zts20786e	...!zts20787e	Hello, what brings you here?zts20788e	Hey, could you take a look at this for me? *You give the alchemist the Mark of the Old Masters.*zts20789e	What are you showing this to me for? What is it anyway?zts20790e	Soraya said that you might know what it is.zts20791e	Oh she did, did she? Wow, this is...zts20792e	Can you feel the special energy too?zts20793e	Yes, it seems to be reverberating the energy of the old masters.zts20794e	You could be more right than you know. That's the Mark of the Old Masters.zts20795e	This energy is unbelievably pure.zts20796e	Pure? That doesn't sound much like the old masters.zts20797e	By pure I mean that the power hasn't been clouded by greed or envy.zts20798e	Hmm... doesn't make any sense to me. Anything else you can tell me?zts20799e	There's something else about this purity. It's wild... almost savage... this is the energy of a wolf!zts20800e	Huh, wolf energy? What do you mean?zts20801e	Yes, this mark is emanating pure wolf energy. But I can't tell you any more than that.zts20802e	I'm even more confused now than I was before. What's all this about pure wolf energy?zts20803e	I suggest you take a look in the library. Maybe you can find out more there.zts20804e	Oh, good idea! I'd better get down to the library.zts20805e	I hope I was able to help you, at least a bit.zts20806e	Yes, you've helped me a lot, thank you!zts20807e	Ah, this is the book! *You open the book.* What? There's nothing here!zts20808e	*The next page is also blank.*zts20809e	Wait a minute... just maybe... *You place the Mark of the Old Masters on the blank page.*zts20810e	Just as I thought! *Some sentences appear on the page.*zts20811e	How cool is that?! Now let's see what it says...zts20812e	- The Book -zts20813e	Erenia, the preserver of all life, brought peace to the world after she defeated of Zenas.zts20814e	But humanity was already corrupted. Erenia became disillusioned by the endless wars the people fought amongst themselves.zts20815e	Her disillusionment turned into fury, and the kindness in her heart cooled.zts20816e	Erenia was overcome by a dark energy which took possession of her spirit.zts20817e	(Whatever happened to Erenia? She must have been so sad!) *You turn the page.*zts20818e	Zenas, on the other hand, lost all her energy after being defeated by Erenia, and dissipated to nothingness.zts20819e	That is until she was healed and her very being was flooded with the light.zts20820e	(Wow, what a twist! I never saw that coming.)zts20821e	So Erenia and Zenas were reborn through these polar opposite energies.zts20822e	Yet the energy of both came from the same source.zts20823e	Zenas served the light, Erenia the darkness, and both fought to ensure their energy was not destroyed by imbalance.zts20824e	(This story is amazing...)zts20825e	Hmm... that seems to be everything. But where's the story of the third master? *You turn over the page.*zts20826e	Ah, here it is!zts20827e	- The Story of the Forgotten Master -zts20828e	This is the story of the third master, the hero of the light: Master Wolf.zts20829e	Lycanthropes are creatures that are half-human, half-wolf. In common parlance they're referred to as werewolves, humans with the bravery and agility of wolves.zts20830e	The strongest and bravest among them found enlightenment through meditation and penance.zts20831e	Harnessing the immense power inside him, he created and honed his own martial arts style.zts20832e	A creature repugnant to behold, he nevertheless fought ceaselessly to bring justice to the world.zts20833e	Eventually, his path led him to discover the secret of virtue, and the people referred to him henceforth as Master Wolf.zts20834e	But one day he was cursed by Erenia, who prematurely aged him and transformed him into an old and wizened wolf. No one knows what happened then, but it's assumed that he ran away and joined a pack of wolves.zts20835e	Hmm, then I'll have to track down this werewolf.zts20836e	Good thing he's standing on the side of justice. But how will I be able to find him?zts20837e	There are so many wolves on Mount Krem. I'll pay Uncle Carven a visit first.zts20838e	Hey, long time no see. How are you?zts20839e	Hey, how are tricks? I'm trying to find a wolf.zts20840e	A wolf? Shouldn't be too hard. There are plenty of them. What do you want a wolf for?zts20841e	Well, it's like this you see... *You tell him your story.*zts20842e	Woah, you've been through a lot. But back to the matter at hand... hmm... there's only one wolf that comes to mind.zts20843e	Tell me!zts20844e	In my youth I always wanted to explore Krem. One day I got lost and stumbled into a wolf's lair.zts20845e	I thought that was the last of me, that I was surely done for. But then a strange-looking wolf approached me.zts20846e	What was strange about the wolf?zts20847e	I can remember his eyes like it was only yesterday. When he looked into mine, it was like he was trying to tell me something.zts20848e	After staring at me for some time, he raised his head and began to howl. The other wolves heard his cries and withdrew. Then he scampered away as well, but before disappearing, he turned to look at me one last time.zts20849e	That might be Master Wolf.zts20850e	Just what I was thinking.zts20851e	Where can I find him?zts20852e	It's a very dangerous place. You'd be putting your life at risk.zts20853e	Don't worry about that. I've grown a lot stronger since we last met. I'm a powerful Martial Artist now!zts20854e	If you say so... well, if you think you need to meet him. Maybe he can teach you something new.zts20855e	Do you remember where you came across him?zts20856e	Travel to Eastern Krem. There's a large cave in the cliffs there.zts20857e	A cave? Great, I should be able to find him now!zts20858e	Just be careful! That wolf only let me go because I was such a handsome young thing.zts20859e	Haha, when you go making jokes like that, it can't be all that dangerous!zts20860e	Bah, you youngsters. How wonderful it must be to feel indestructible. Well, good luck and look out for yourself!zts20861e	Farewell! Take care of yourself, Carven.zts20862e	(Wow, that must be the cave Carven spoke of. I must admit, it's giving me goosebumps just thinking of venturing inside, but I have to go in if I want to learn the truth.)zts20863e	(Woah, That's a long way down! God, it makes me dizzy just to look... come on... pull yourself together!)zts20864e	(Hmm... no exit here. Oh, those sentinels are from the angels and demons. Then I must be on the right track.)zts20865e	(So many wolves here. I should do my best to avoid fighting them.)zts20866e	(If I accidentally beat up one of his friends, Master Wolf won't be best pleased!)zts20867e	(Done it! He must be in here somewhere. Let's go!)zts20868e	(That must be the wolf Carven spoke of. He's absolutely huge!)zts20869e	*woof* *grrr*zts20870e	Hello? Are you Master Wolf? I'm not here to fight you!zts20871e	*grrrrrr* *GRRRRRR*zts20872e	(My word! Carven really must've been more handsome than me... well, no option now but to fight!)zts20873e	Gah, that was a tough fight... please don't bite me! Here, look at this... *You show him the Mark of the Old Masters.*zts20874e	*grrr, whine* *The mark transforms into a ball of energy which flies into the wolf's jaws.*zts20875e	Oh my! The mark disappeared and the wolf has been transformed! Are you Master Wolf?zts20876e	Who are you? And how do you know my name?zts20877e	Draconic Fist and Mystic Arts told me your name.zts20878e	You met my friends?zts20879e	Yes, I did. They've disappeared, but they told me to find you and the fourth master and uncover the truth.zts20880e	Then there's still a ray of hope. I must join them.zts20881e	Please, give me your power.zts20882e	I shall, but only if you promise to use it for good. Use it to uncover the truth!zts20883e	Yes, Master. But what happened to you? Why were you transformed into a wolf?zts20884e	You'll have to find that out for yourself. Seek out the fourth master, and the truth shall be revealed.zts20885e	Oh no! You're turning back into a wolf!zts20886e	The mark's energy allowed me to become myself again... but its power is waning... *whine, grrr*zts20887e	Mark my words: the fourth master will soon appear... she can feel my energy...zts20888e	What's happening to you? Master Wolf!zts20889e	*grrrr* *arh-WOOOOOO*zts20890e	*The wolf looks at you indifferently for a moment, then scurries off.*zts20891e	I hate sad goodbyes. I will find out the truth, I promise. Goodbye, Master Wolf!zts20892e	Rainbow Shopzts20893e	12th Anniversary Giftzts20896e	12th Anniversary Eventzts20897e	NosTale's celebrating its 12th anniversary and it's all thanks to you! *applause*zts20898e	That's why we have the best present ever for our 12th anniversary!zts20899e	If you bring me the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 12, I'll transform them into your gift.zts20900e	Exchange for 12th Anniversary Medalzts20901e	Exchange for 12th Anniversary Buffzts20902e	The 12th Anniversary Medal has many shop item functions.zts20903e	You need all the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 12. Do you want to exchange them?zts20904e	The 12th Anniversary Buff increases your maximum HP and MP for 3,200 seconds.zts20905e	You need the letters Y, E, A, R plus the number 12. Do you want to receive the buff?zts20910e	Filled with evil energy (Quest of the Shadow Element Martial Artist)zts20911e	- The Martial Artist: Hero of the Shadows -zts20912e	You're back. Did you meet Master Wolf?zts20913e	Yes. And I learned all of his skills.zts20914e	That's fantastic! You look pretty rough.zts20915e	Yes, I feel kind of weird and... depressed. I need to rest.zts20916e	Your body seems to be filled with some strange sort of energy.zts20917e	I just need some rest.zts20918e	I hope you're right. But this energy is really unusual... Could you do me a favour? Would you please bring this to Catlotte?zts20919e	(Hey, you! Kitty cat with the huge eyes!) Excuse me... are you Catlotte?zts20920e	Why yes, I am. Woah, you have some really odd energy in you. Who are you?zts20921e	(I'm the most powerful and beautiful girl in the whole world! Hahahaha!) Quiet now! I'm an adventurer, I was sent by Carven. (You hand her the gemstone.)zts20922e	That's kind of Carven. Wow, this is an exceptionally pretty gemstone. But... I think he might have sent you to me for a different reason. Hmm, let met take a closer look at you...zts20923e	(Say what? Get your hands off me!) Ah, that wasn't me! I don't know who said that. Please forgive me.zts20924e	Don't worry about it. You've been possessed by a spirit. A pretty annoying but powerful one.zts20925e	Really? So it's the spirit that keep interrupting me?zts20926e	Correct. You should get rid of it as soon as possible, otherwise... you might die.zts20927e	(Huh? I'm already dead!) Oh no, what am I going to do?zts20928e	What do you think, Catrisha?zts20929e	Who's Catrisha? Ah, there she is, sitting next to Catlotte. (That's annoying!)zts20930e	Woah, this spirit seems to be the soul of a vain demon lady.zts20931e	What? The soul of a female demon?zts20932e	And she seems to like luxurious things... Okay, we now what to do.zts20933e	And what's that? (Yeah, come on, spit it out! Hehehe!)zts20934e	We can use Carven's gemstone to craft a pretty necklace. Maybe we can use it to lure her out.zts20935e	But it can't be done everywhere. You should try it at the place where the ghost came from.zts20936e	Hm... Oh! There is a cave in Krem, a sanctuary of the demons. That could be the right place.zts20937e	And who will craft the gemstone necklace?zts20938e	I can do that. I am an excellent jeweller, hehe.zts20939e	Wonderful, please do.zts20940e	It could take a while. How about you explore the Demon Sanctuary until I'm done here?zts20941e	Good idea! However, that place is very well hidden. Only the demons know where it is. So you'll have to find it first.zts20942e	Okay. I'll look for the sanctuary and you can craft a pretty necklace for me.zts20943e	The spirit inside you is already quite strong. Here, take this. It'll weaken its influence for a while.zts20944e	What a pretty ring. Why are you giving it to me?zts20945e	This ring will fascinate the spirit so much that it won't be able to control you.zts20946e	Ah, I see. Thank you!zts20947e	(The ring seems to be working, I feel better already. I should stop by Carven first.)zts20948e	I'm back, Uncle!zts20949e	You look a bit better already. Were you able to rest a little?zts20950e	Not yet, unfortunately. But this ring is protecting me from the soul of a demon.zts20951e	Did you just say 'demon'? This energy is of demonic origin then?zts20952e	Yes, at least that's what Catlotte and Catrisha said. And now I have to find the Demon Sanctuary.zts20953e	Oh, that won't be easy.zts20954e	I have to succeed, otherwise I may never get rid of this spirit.zts20955e	Then you should find the Rosebud Witch. No one knows more about demons than her.zts20956e	Where can I find her?zts20957e	She dwells in the second basement of the Shanera Dungeon.zts20958e	Okay, thanks for the tip!zts20959e	Of course. Take care of yourself!zts20960e	I've collected some pieces of the Time-Space. Now I'd better move on to a different place.zts20961e	I've gathered all the map pieces. Now back to Carven, I bet he has glue.zts20962e	Look, Carven! I did it! I know now where the sanctuary is.zts20963e	Excellent! Give me the map pieces, I'll glue them together.zts20964e	(Yeees, devote all your attention to me!) Urgh, I'm sorry.zts20965e	The ring seems to be losing its power. Please hurry!zts20966e	Yes, I should go back to Catlotte. (She's a loyal servant. I can't wait to see the necklace she's making for me, hehe!)zts20970e	The necklace is in this sealed chest. Don't open it until you're inside the sanctuary.zts20971e	(Open it, OPEN IT!) I see. Thank you, thank you so much!zts20973e	Oh, that's convenient. Thank you for your help.zts20974e	Ah, the Demon Sanctuary. Into the cave we go. Hm, I am a bit nervous about facing this spirit. (You open the chest and take out the necklace.)zts20975e	Come on out, demonic spirit! Show yourself! Look, here's the necklace.zts20976e	Oooooh, that's a gorgeous necklace! And it's all mine, hehe!zts20977e	(Oh, that's a pretty demon! *cough*) What were you doing in my body?zts20978e	How could I resist such a beautiful necklace? I just had to come out, hehe.zts20979e	I asked you why...zts20980e	Wait a minute! You were looking for me, weren't you? Well, here I am. You should be grateful!zts20981e	What do you mean? I wasn't looking for you.zts20982e	I saw what you saw. It was so nice to see my old friends again.zts20983e	Hmm? Then you're...zts20984e	That's right, I am the fourth master.zts20985e	I knew there were many types of heroes but who knew a demon could become one... Anyway, it's nice to meet you.zts20986e	Don't rejoice too soon. Your true test is yet to come, hehe.zts20987e	What test? Hey, wait, I'm not ready yet!zts20988e	Hoho, you have passed the test. I will transfer my powers to you. Now you're the hero who unites the powers of all the masters.zts20989e	Thank you! But I'd like to find out more about you.zts20990e	You will. This book has all the answers that you're looking for.zts20991e	Oh, can I read it now? I'm dying to find out how the story ended.zts20992e	- The Book -zts20993e	Erenia was never averse to war. All the battles the humans fought out of greed and hatred made the dark power inside her grow.zts20994e	She became stronger and stronger until she finally defeated the ruler of hell and took his place.zts20995e	Zenas, however, had to grow stronger to save the world. But the humans didn't understand what peace meant.zts20996e	So Zenas turned her back on them and let them wage their wars.zts20997e	Zenas received the power of light, while humanity was suffering from war. Finally, Zenas subdued all of Mystic Heaven.zts20998e	Erenia and Zenas secretly promised to continue the war between Hellord and Mystic Heaven to maintain balance and expand their power.zts20999e	Four heroes among Erenia's and Zenas' followers could not bear the situation any longer and decided not to serve the goddesses anymore.zts21000e	They tried to prevent war and spread the truth. But Erenia and Zenas worked together to lock up the heroes.zts21001e	And so the war between the two goddesses raged on...zts21002e	I didn't know that Zenas' and Erenia's scheme was the reason the endless war began.zts21003e	Do you understand? We fought for the truth and this curse was our reward. Now that you know the truth, it will be revealed to everyone. Nothing will change for the time-being. But you alleviate our fears.zts21004e	Everyone will remember you as heroes. With your powers, I will save this world.zts21005e	Oh, I like you. I will rest now, I'm tired of playing a spirit.zts21006e	Of course. Don't worry about this world. May you rest in peace.zts21007e	Wonderful! Let's exchange this necklace for my powers, hahaha. Goodbye, new hero! The old hero is out!zts21008e	Don't worry. I will fight for peace in NosVille and tell everyone the truth. May the old heroes rest in peace...zts21009e	Hello, are you the Rosebud Witch? I'm looking for the Demon Sanctuary.zts21010e	Why yes, I am. You are the first human to ask me about the Demon Sanctuary. What do you want from there?zts21011e	I have a demonic spirit inside me. I need to go there to banish it from my body.zts21012e	Interesting. Only demons know the sanctuary. The demons dwell in the third basement of the Shanera Dungeon. There's a stone there that takes them to the sanctuary.zts21013e	Good. I despise demons and I'm great at defeating them.zts21014e	Wow! Of course a brave Adventurer like you is not afraid of demons then. Good luck!zts21015e	Thank you! Bye for now.zts21016e	You have returned. Did you meet the demonic spirit?zts21017e	Yes. She was the hero I'd been looking for. I found the last hero and I also learned the truth.zts21018e	The truth? A truth I don't know about?zts21019e	Possibly. But very soon, everyone will know.zts21020e	Interesting. I'm looking forward to hearing this truth.zts21021e	I don't need the ring and the necklace anymore. I'd like to give them back to you.zts21022e	Thank you very much, hehe. I'll hold on to them. Good luck, new hero!zts21023e	Did you mean to ask me that? (You're a bad person. I'm angry!)zts21024e	The strange energy is messing with your mind. Quick, take this gemstone to Catlotte.zts21025e	Oh, what did I say to you? I'm sorry. I better do as you say. (I'm sulking.)zts21026e	Oh, it's getting worse. I need to hurry.zts21027e	Yes, hurry!zts21028e	(Hahaha! Let's go!)zts21029e	Catlotte, I've found a stone that can take me there.zts21030e	Wow, excellent!zts21031e	(Show me the necklace this instant!) I'm sorry, Catlotte. The ring has stopped working.zts21032e	Her desire for extravagance is remarkably strong. But don't worry, I've finished the necklace.zts21033e	(Good. Give it to me!) I should hurry.zts21034e	You can use the Time-Space stone to teleport to the sanctuary.zts21035e	Understood. Thank you for your help.zts21036e	Good luck!zts21037e	The Missing Treasure Hunters (Act 7 Side Quest)zts21038e	Hey you, are you going east?zts21039e	Excuse me?zts21040e	I know two treasure hunters with the Akamur Merchants. They're brothers and also my friends. They set off on a ship going east looking for treasures a few months ago. I haven't heard anything from them since. Could you keep an eye out for them, please, if you're heading east?zts21041e	I'll keep my eyes peeled if I travel east.zts21042e	Maybe later.zts21043e	Act 7 - Cause for the Arrivalzts21044e	Hey adventurer! Do you want to hear the latest news from Mortaz Desert?zts21045e	Huh? Has a war broken out?zts21046e	Fortunately not. But there are some astounding rumours about a very special tribe going around.zts21047e	Really? What sort of tribe?zts21048e	They're huge creatures from the Far East who call themselves 'orcs'. Mortaz merchants and seamen are really nervous because there's an unknown island. But the orcs don't want to give away where it is.zts21049e	Why not?zts21050e	To be honest, I'm not sure. Maybe they're just wary of us. Could you convince them to reveal the location of the island?zts21051e	I'm curious as to where this unknown island is. That's why I'm going to go and see the orcs.zts21052e	Act 7 - Off to New Shores!zts21053e	Are you the orcs from the island in the East?zts21054e	Yes.zts21055e	Why don't you want anyone to know where the island is? We would surely get on well with your people.zts21056e	We're looking for someone strong to help us. Our island has a big problem at the moment. We'll only talk about it with someone we trust, and who will help us. As per our tradition.zts21057e	I see. Then tell me your story. I think I can help you.zts21058e	Are you sure you're strong enough?zts21059e	Yes. I'm absolutely certain of that.zts21060e	I can feel your energy. You seem to be telling the truth. Okay. I trust you. We come from Moritius Island far, far east of here.zts21061e	It used to be very fertile. But then a long period of drought came and many of us starved. Our chief gave orders for a very high tower to be built. He believed that it would rain again if we pierced the sky with the spire. Some of us had a different opinion and didn't want to be forced into labour against our will. So we fled. But the rest of our people are still there and need your help. Please convince the chief that he should stop building the tower.zts21062e	What? He wants to pierce the sky?zts21063e	Yes. He has an ancient, enchanted spear. According to legend, it can pierce through anything.zts21064e	That sounds like a bad idea. His plan could have devastating consequences. I need to go there.zts21065e	I will guide you across the sea to Moritius.zts21066e	Act 7 - The Harbour Guardzts21067e	(Oh... I've never seen such demons and monsters. I'll ask the Harbour Guard Perkichan what happened here.)zts21068e	Act 7 - Perkichan's Worrieszts21069e	Oh, Propga, is that really you? I thought you were dead. It's so good to see you! But who's that with you?zts21070e	An adventurer from the West who wants to help us.zts21071e	I see. Propga's friends are my friends, too. I trust you. Welcome to Moritius, where it's just swarming with demons and monsters, haha!zts21072e	Thanks. What happened here?zts21073e	After Propga left, the Celestial Spire was eventually completed. Then the sky became dark and, all of a sudden, countless demons and monsters appeared.  I quickly went and hid on the boat. When it became quiet, I came out again and saw that many of us were dead. I heard that the chief died fighting a demon. Of all the orcs that were still at the tower, only a single warrior survived. It was Tator, and he's now our chief.zts21074e	Thank you for telling me all of that. I'll ask the chief for more details. Are you coming, Propga?zts21075e	I would like to but I can't. I'm really worried about my relatives and neighbours. I'm sorry.zts21076e	I completely understand. I'll go alone.zts21077e	Act 7 - Cleaning the Beacheszts21078e	Wait, my friend. You owe me something for my story. See the monsters on the beach there? The fishermen aren't able to fish because of them. Defeat the monsters for us!zts21079e	Okay. Understood.zts21081e	Act 7 - Job Donezts21082e	(It's done. No more monsters will appear. Off to Perkichan.)zts21083e	Act 7 - Gifts for the Villagezts21084e	Great work! I'll enlighten you on another matter: because of the monsters, it's not easy to enter our village.zts21085e	So how do I get in?zts21086e	That's what I'm going to explain to you now. To be able to fight the monsters, the guards need meat. And the chief loves Cherry Apples.zts21087e	What are Cherry Apples?zts21088e	Oh, you don't know them? You poor thing! You've just got to try them. The flesh of the fruit is sweet and sour at the same time. Simply delicious beyond words. You'll find these apples in the forest. And Owlbear Meat would be good.zts21089e	Oh, one more thing: you should address our chief as 'Great Tator'.zts21090e	Okay. I'll keep that in mind. Now I've got to get some Owlbear Meat and Cherry Apples before I go to the village.zts21091e	Act 7 - The Freshness Testzts21092e	(That should be enough. Now I'll go to the orc village).zts21093e	Act 7 - The Orc Chieftainzts21094e	Stop! You look strange. You can't be an orc. Who are you?zts21095e	Hello, I'm an adventurer from the West. I came here with Propga.zts21096e	What? Propga? The fisherman who fled?zts21097e	Yes. That's him.zts21098e	Why should I believe you? My chief has forbidden me from letting strangers through this gate.zts21099e	I've come to talk to your chief. I also have a gift for him.zts21100e	No, you may not pass.zts21101e	Hmm. I've also got some delicious meat. But I suppose I'd better eat that myself, then. So long.zts21102e	W... wait! Okay. I'll allow you to enter. You have my permission. But if you act strangely in any way, I'll get you.zts21103e	Understood. I'll behave myself.zts21104e	Act 7 - Trial of the Orc Warriorzts21105e	Welcome, stranger. Taritus has already told me about you. What brings you here?zts21106e	I appreciate your hospitality, Great Tator. I come from the West, from NosVille. Propga brought me here to help you.zts21107e	I see. But I wonder if you can really help us. You look weaker than my warrior women.zts21108e	Don't worry about that. I'm stronger than you think.zts21109e	Haha, you've got guts. I like that. I have an idea.zts21110e	I'm listening.zts21111e	When we come of age, we orcs must undertake a test. If you pass this test, I will trust you and declare you a warrior.zts21112e	Good, I'll prove to you how brave I am.zts21113e	This is the test for becoming an orc warrior. I'll definitely pass it.zts21114e	(The test was more difficult than I expected. Now I can face the chief full of pride.)zts21115e	Act 7 - Captain of the Guardzts21116e	You succeeded. I wasn't expecting you to. I'm sorry that I misjudged you.zts21117e	That's okay. Am I a real warrior now?zts21118e	Yes. You've earned it. Congratulations.zts21119e	Thank you, I appreciate that. May I ask you something?zts21120e	Be my guest.zts21121e	Do you know what happened at the Celestial Spire? I only know that it was built in order to end the drought.zts21122e	That's right. I will tell you the whole story.zts21123e	I was the general under Chief Urgos. He was a good ruler. Once the tower was completed, I took Urgos and his sorcerer to the top of the spire. They held a ceremony there.zts21124e	I'm guessing the idea was to pierce through the sky?zts21125e	Yes, the sorcerer infused the magical spear with the power of the Loa. And then Urgos thrust the spear into the sky. We were expecting rain to fall from the sky, but demons and monsters fell to earth instead. They spread quickly over the whole island. How stupid we were! And then a huge demon appeared, who seemed to be their leader. Urgos fought with all his might against this demon. In the end he defeated it but he, too, was mortally wounded. He ordered me to withdraw... and then he died. The rest of us tried to go down the tower while fighting the demons on the stairs. Having reached the bottom, I realised I was the only survivor.zts21126e	What a terrible tragedy!zts21127e	I sealed the tower so the monsters couldn't spread any further. Thanks to Urgos' sacrifice, we were able to start rebuilding our village.zts21128e	You were surely pleased about that.zts21129e	Well, that's the end of the story. I will now allocate you some work for my village.zts21130e	Very well. I'm ready for any task.zts21131e	On the way to the Polluted Forest, there is a guard captain called Litatiz. He reported a problem in the forest. Go and help him.zts21132e	Yes, Great Tator.zts21133e	Act 7 - Scout in Needzts21134e	The chief has ordered me to come and help you.zts21135e	I've already heard about you. Are you the stranger who passed the warrior's test?zts21136e	Yes. That's me. News travels fast around here!zts21137e	I've got eyes and ears everywhere. I know about everything on this island.zts21138e	(He seems to be boasting.)zts21139e	Can you take on a mission for me? This path leads to the Polluted Forest. The forest is one of the areas most contaminated by evil. I sent out two scouts to find out the cause. But they haven't returned. I've already sent units out to look for the scouts, but most have returned wounded. Can you bring the scouts back?zts21140e	Okay. I'll bring them back.zts21141e	Act 7 - Help is Coming!zts21142e	(There's an orc who seems to be one of the missing scouts. He's surrounded by monsters. I should defeat the monsters first.)zts21143e	Act 7 - The Missing Scoutzts21144e	(That was close. He seems to be safe.)zts21145e	Act 7 - The Search for the Scoutzts21146e	Thank you very much. You look like you're not from around here.zts21147e	I come from NosVille. Litatiz sent me to rescue you.zts21148e	But where is your companion?zts21149e	His name is Logtas. We were both investigating why the forest is polluted. At some point we found a cave that was radiating a lot of evil energy. It became clear to us that it was the cause of the contamination. We tried to force our way in and investigate further, but we had to retreat very quickly because this awful energy from the depths of the cave was stronger than us. During the retreat, Logtas and I got separated. I wanted to go back into the cave and look for him, but then a whole horde of monsters appeared suddenly. I was so afraid that I ran from the cave. I've behaved like a coward and I'm ashamed that I left him behind. Please save him!zts21150e	Of course. I'll go to the cave.zts21151e	Act 7 - The Eerie Cavezts21152e	(Oh... Unfortunately, Logtas is already dead. I should have come more quickly. But I will find the source of this terrible energy.)zts21153e	Act 7 - The Power of Evilzts21154e	(Oh, this cave is already contaminated to a great extent.zts21155e	I must remove the source of the contamination. Otherwise, it could spread to the village.)zts21156e	Act 7 - Mission Reportzts21157e	(I've destroyed the Obelisk of Evil but... Logtas' death is really affecting me. I should report to the guard captain now. Off to see Litatiz.)zts21158e	Act 7 - Sad Newszts21159e	(You report to Litatiz about the cave, and explain where Tatirus and Logtas are.)zts21160e	So Logtas is dead, then. He was one of the best guards. He was only recently married. I shouldn't have sent him there.zts21161e	It's not your fault. I should have saved him.zts21162e	Don't blame yourself. At least you have avenged his death. Incidentally, Tatirus hasn't come back yet. I should look for her first. Could you take care of something important for me? Here is Logtas' letter. It's a tradition of ours to write down our last wishes before a dangerous mission. Could you deliver this letter to his wife? You can refuse my request if you're not prepared to do it.zts21163e	I'll do it.zts21164e	Act 7 - Food for the Funeralzts21165e	Hello, are you Logtas' wife?zts21166e	Yes. What brings you here?zts21167e	I'm sorry, but I'm to give you Logtas' letter.zts21168e	So that means he's dead. Right?zts21169e	I'm sorry that I couldn't save him.zts21170e	You don't need to apologise. These days there are lots of missing and dead soldiers. Such sad news was only to be expected. But even so I can't stop crying.zts21171e	I am so sorry...zts21172e	Thank you for bringing me my husband's letter. That can't have been easy. Could you perhaps do me one more favour?zts21173e	Yes, of course.zts21174e	I need various foods for Logtas' funeral ceremony. Could you fetch them from the grocery store for me? There's still so much I need to do for the ceremony.zts21175e	Yes. I'll bring you the food.zts21176e	Go to Ituros, the grocery store belongs to her. You'll recognise her by her white apron. She knows what I need.zts21177e	Act 7 - A Balanced Mealzts21178e	(This woman looks like the owner of the grocery store.) Hello.zts21179e	Hello! What can I do for you? You're not from here.zts21180e	Yes, I come from the Far West. I need food for a funeral.zts21181e	Oh... someone has died, then?zts21182e	Yes, a guard called Logtas. He died on a mission.zts21183e	How sad. Unfortunately, we don't have enough food for funerals because so many are dying these days. Owlbear Meat and Hill Strawberries in particular are sold out.zts21184e	I need these foods for his wife. Can I help you get them?zts21185e	That's very kind of you. You can get meat from the Owlbears close to the Woodland Path. And you can find Hill Strawberries on the Forest Cliff.zts21186e	Okay.zts21187e	Watch out for demons and monsters in the forest.zts21188e	(I've got the meat and the berries. Back to Ituros, then.)zts21189e	Act 7 - An Orc Funeralzts21190e	Here you are.zts21191e	Wow! Fresh meat and berries. Now I can give you what you need.zts21192e	Act 7 - Mourning a Lost Brotherzts21193e	I'm back. Here you are. Do you need anything else?zts21194e	The food is enough. But I've forgotten something important.zts21195e	I'm listening.zts21196e	According to an orc tradition, close relatives are invited to the funeral.zts21197e	Logtas only has an older brother called Martas. Out of sheer grief, I've forgotten to inform him. Could you ask him to come?zts21198e	No problem.zts21199e	Thank you! Martas is a blacksmith. He wears a leather apron and holds a hammer in his hand.zts21200e	Act 7 - One Step at a Timezts21201e	Hello, are you Martas, Logtas' older brother?zts21202e	Yes. Are you here about Logtas?zts21203e	How did you know that?zts21204e	Whenever someone comes here, they usually ask whether I'm a blacksmith. But you've come looking for Logtas' brother. What's happened to my little brother?zts21205e	I'm afraid he died on a mission. His wife invites you to come to his funeral.zts21206e	Oh... the little guy was much to young to die. Although I was against him becoming a guard, I couldn't change his mind. He was so proud. I would like to come. But I have too much to do because my chief has ordered a lot of weapons for tomorrow. So it won't be possible for me to attend the funeral.zts21207e	Can I help you in some way, so that you can finish your work earlier?zts21208e	Your hands don't seem to be made for the hammer. But perhaps there is something you can do.zts21209e	Which would be?zts21210e	There are lots of weapons chests that have been left behind on the farm. There are still weapons in some of the chests. If you bring them to me, I'll just need to sharpen them.zts21211e	That's a good idea. I'll take care of it and be back soon.zts21212e	(There are lots of monsters here. I had better deal with them before searching through the weapons chests.)zts21213e	Act 7 - Recyclingzts21214e	(Now I've decimated the monsters, I can get the weapons out of the chests.)zts21215e	(It's done. Now I just have to take the weapons to Martas.)zts21216e	Act 7 - Gone Fishin'zts21217e	What do you think of the weapons?zts21218e	Let's see... Oh, they're in good condition. Thanks to you, I can now go to my brother's funeral. Thanks.zts21219e	By the way... Ituros was looking for you.zts21220e	The owner of the grocery store? I'll go and see her in her shop.zts21221e	Were you looking for me?zts21222e	You've arrived just at the right time. I need your help.zts21223e	The fishermen are supposed to send me fish every day. But in the last few days, not a single one has got here. I would go myself but I can't just close my shop. Could you go to the beach and see what's going on?zts21224e	Of course, no problem. Who should I look out for?zts21225e	Propga is the fishermen's leader. Maybe he knows something.zts21226e	That's convenient. He's my friend. I'll go to him, then.zts21227e	Act 7 - Gone Fishin' Where?zts21228e	(Here's the beach where Propga's supposed to be. But I can't see any fishermen here. I'll have a look around.)zts21229e	(The fishing net and fish trap are broken. What happened here?)zts21230e	(The cart is broken as well. The fishermen and fish boxes have disappeared.)zts21231e	(Oh... that looks like bloodstains. The fishermen seem to be in danger. I have to follow the bloodstains quickly.)zts21232e	Act 7 - Big Fishzts21233e	(This cave seems suspicious. I'll have a look around inside.)zts21234e	Act 7 - Fate of the Fishermenzts21235e	(That was an enormous and brutal merling. The poor fishermen. But I've avenged their deaths. May they rest in peace. I should inform Propga.zts21236e	Act 7 - Fish Deliverieszts21237e	You're back. Did you find out anything?zts21238e	I came across a cave with a Large Merling inside. I dealt with him but the fishermen inside the cave were already dead. I'm very sorry. Here are their fish boxes.zts21239e	Thank you for seeing to their murderer. I am indeed very sad about their deaths, but now I've got to work even harder to supply the village with fish.zts21240e	Okay...zts21241e	Act 7 - A Farmer's Requestzts21242e	What happened on the South Beach?zts21243e	I encountered a Large Merling in a cave. He killed the fishermen and stole their fish. Then I defeated the merling. Propga is trying to deliver fish again.zts21244e	Oh, it's so sad that even more of us had to die. Thank you very much for your efforts.zts21245e	I hope this tragedy doesn't repeat itself.zts21246e	Yes. I hope so, too... By the way, have you met Kachantrok yet?zts21247e	No, who's that?zts21248e	An extraordinary farmer from our village. He was looking for you a while ago. He wears a white, cone-shaped hat and holds a sickle in his hand.zts21249e	A white, cone-shaped hat? Then he should be easy to find.zts21250e	Act 7 - The Missing Farmerzts21251e	Are you Kachantrok, the extraordinary farmer here in the village?zts21252e	Yes. But I'm not so keen on the title.zts21253e	Oh, sorry. I didn't know. Why are you looking for me?zts21254e	My brother wanted to go and fetch some wood but hasn't come back.zts21255e	I see. How long has he been gone?zts21256e	About half a day.zts21257e	Where did he go?zts21258e	I think he wanted to go to the Spirit Forest because of the particularly high number of trees there.zts21259e	The Spirit Forest. I'll go there now, then.zts21260e	Thanks!zts21261e	(Maybe he's left a trail. I should look for that first.)zts21262e	(There are footprints and wood splinters there. Someone's passed through here.)zts21263e	(A piece of wood is lying on the ground there. But where is he? I'll look around a bit more.)zts21264e	(His tracks lead deeper into the forest.)zts21265e	Act 7 - Spooky!zts21266e	(An orc is under attack by ghosts. It seems to be Kachantrok's brother. I should defeat the spirits first.)zts21267e	(That was close! The spirits were pretty hostile!)zts21268e	Act 7 - Farmer Kujeantrokzts21269e	Are you Kachantrok's brother?zts21270e	Yes! Do you know my younger brother?zts21271e	Yes. He asked me to look for you in this forest.zts21272e	Are you sure? He's really too shy to ask anyone for anything. His courage impresses me. Haha.zts21273e	Is he really that shy?zts21274e	Yes. He wouldn't even ask me for anything. He works very hard and never accepts help. And so he became an extraordinary farmer in the village.zts21275e	Sounds logical. What are you doing here exactly?zts21276e	Collecting wood. There's high-quality wood in this forest. The spirits have lived here for a long time, but they never used to be aggressive. I have no idea why that's changed.zts21277e	I see. Your brother is worried about you. Go back to the village.zts21278e	Yes. Thank you for your help. Come on, let's go!zts21279e	After you. (I must find out why the spirits have become vicious.)zts21280e	Act 7 - Mad Spiritszts21281e	Is Kujeantrok back?zts21282e	Yes. He's fallen asleep already. Thank you for your help.zts21283e	You're welcome. By the way... do you know anyone who knows about spirits?zts21284e	Just one: our chief.zts21285e	Thanks. Then I'll go and see him again.zts21286e	Long time no see. I've been hearing about your remarkable activities.zts21287e	You give me too much credit. I would like to know a bit about spirits. Why have they become so aggressive?zts21288e	They are normally very peaceful. Something's not right there.zts21289e	They attacked Kujeantrok and I for no apparent reason.zts21290e	Perhaps something has happened to the Spirit King, then. Ask my warlock for advice. He's a little dour. But I'll give you a letter to take with you that will help. Here you are.zts21291e	Act 7 - Summoning the Spirit Kingzts21292e	Excuse me. Are you the warlock?zts21293e	Yes! I'm the warlock Pikidir. You must be the stranger from the West. What are you doing here? I didn't send for you.zts21294e	I need your help. The forest spirits have suddenly become aggressive. I want to find out why.zts21295e	I'm busy at the moment. Find out on your own.zts21296e	Your chief gave me a letter to bring with me.zts21297e	What? I'm not willing to help you but I must obey my chief's orders.zts21298e	Will you help me, then?zts21299e	Listen carefully. I won't say this twice. There is Spirit King in the forest. I'm certain something bad has happened to him. You should look for him.zts21300e	How do I find the Spirit King?zts21301e	The Spirit King has a separate altar deep in the forest. If you take a Spirit Forest Branch, a Golem Core and a Jade Stone to this altar, you will reach him.zts21302e	Thank you very much. (I wonder what the Spirit King looks like.)zts21303e	(At last, I've got all the materials. Off to the altar.)zts21304e	Act 7 - The Twisted Spirit Kingzts21305e	(Oh no! The Spirit King has already been corrupted. There's no other way, I'll have to fight him.)zts21306e	Did you help me? You're my saviour!zts21307e	You've now been cleansed of evil. What happened to you?zts21308e	As more and more demons and monsters spread across Moritius Island, the evil also spread to this forest. At first I could cleanse myself with my own power. But soon the evil energy was stronger than me.zts21309e	And that's how you were corrupted? Is that right?zts21310e	Yes. And of that I'm deeply ashamed. I tried to heal myself during periods of consciousness but I didn't succeed. I owe you one. Thanks!zts21311e	You're welcome. So your spirits won't attack the orcs anymore, right?zts21312e	They obviously did that to protect me. But first I must regain my full power to be able to control them.  And that will take some time.zts21313e	I see. I'll let the orcs know that they should be careful for a while longer.zts21314e	Wait. There's something else on my mind.zts21315e	Before I took leave of my senses, I asked my friend, the Beast King Carno, for help. But he didn't reply. I suspect he's been corrupted as well. Please cleanse him, too. I can't fight all the demons and monsters on this island alone.zts21316e	I see. Where do I need to go?zts21317e	Go to the Beast's Lair. You'll find him there.zts21318e	Okay. I'll set off there right away.zts21319e	Act 7 - Show Your Worthzts21320e	Hello, are you a solider responsible for the guard here?zts21321e	Yes. That's me. May I ask what brings you here?zts21322e	I'm looking for the Beast King.zts21323e	There is no Beast King anymore. He's just a depraved beast now.zts21324e	I understand what you mean. I'm here to cleanse the beast. Where is it, exactly?zts21325e	I can't tell you that because the king is too strong. No one can defeat him. That's why I'm here. I cannot allow anyone to enter the cave.zts21326e	I'm strong enough to try.zts21327e	You're very brave. Very well. But first prove to me how strong you really are. Can you defeat the demons and monsters here?zts21328e	Child's play. I'll be back soon.zts21329e	(The monsters were strong, but not strong enough for me. Now I'll find out where the Beast King is.)zts21330e	Act 7 - The Hunt Beginszts21331e	I've passed your test.zts21332e	You're stronger than I thought! I'll keep my promise.zts21333e	Carno is resting after the orc heroes' attacks.zts21334e	Orc heroes?zts21335e	Strictly speaking, they are the orc heroes' descendants. In the then war between light and shadow, there were four powerful orc heroes. Their direct descendants are now fighting against the Twisted Beast King.zts21336e	I see. And where is the Beast King's resting place?zts21337e	Somewhere deep inside the Beast's Lair.zts21338e	Understood. I'll make my way inside.zts21339e	Act 7 - Hunter or Hunted?zts21340e	I think I'm very close to the king's resting place. I can feel his bad energy. It's even stronger than that of the Spirit King. I should be careful.zts21341e	Act 7 - The First Descendant of the Four Heroeszts21342e	Thank you for your help. Who are you?zts21343e	I am Cottari, a descendant of the Beast Overlord. Carno could come back.zts21344e	Let's meet on the north side of the Beast's Lair.zts21345e	Act 7 - Test of Couragezts21346e	I've been waiting for you.zts21347e	Ligtas has told me about you. You're one of the descendants of the four heroes, aren't you?zts21348e	That's correct. We were born with the heroes' talent. And, nevertheless, we train body and mind to fulfil the wishes of our forefathers.zts21349e	I must defeat Carno.zts21350e	As far as I can tell, you have the potential to defeat him. But you're not quite ready yet. You should further strengthen your power beforehand.zts21351e	And how do I do that?zts21352e	Firstly, you'll need the four relics of the orc heroes. For each test of the elements that you pass, you'll receive a relic. Once you have four relics, you will obtain true power.zts21353e	I understand. I'll try it now.zts21354e	Why don't you try the 'Beast Overlord's Test of Courage' near here?zts21355e	(This is the Test of Courage. I'll pass it for sure.)zts21356e	(Done. The test was really difficult. Now I should go to Cottari.)zts21357e	Act 7 - The Second Descendant of the Four Heroeszts21358e	I knew it. You must be the chosen one. Now you have three more tests to face.zts21359e	Where do I need to go?zts21360e	The next test is the 'Test of Patience'. In the Spirit Forest there is an orc with a big hammer. His name is Datitus. Go to him with the Relic of the Water Hero.zts21361e	Act 7 - Test of Patiencezts21362e	Are you Datitus, one of the descendants of the orc heroes?zts21363e	Yes. What can I do for you?zts21364e	(You show him the Relic of the Water Hero.)zts21365e	Hahaha, you're the one Cottari's chosen. You've earned the right to take the next test, the 'Test of Patience'. If you pass it, you'll receive the Relic of the Light Hero.zts21366e	(This is the Test of Patience. I'll definitely pass it.)zts21367e	(Evidently the tests get harder and harder. But I've already passed half of them. I should return to Datitus now.)zts21368e	Act 7 - The Third Descendant of the Four Heroeszts21369e	Fantastic! Now you can take the third test, the 'Test of Passion'. Find Taitur, an orc woman by the Forest Cliff who has claws on both hands. Show her the Relic of the Light Hero.zts21370e	Okay. Do you know anything else about her?zts21371e	She's very fierce. Bear that in mind.zts21372e	I will. Thanks!zts21373e	Act 7 - Test of Passionzts21374e	Hello, are you...zts21375e	Who are you? Come on, speak!zts21376e	(You show her the Relic of the Light Hero.)zts21377e	Are you the one Cottari's chosen? You seem rather too weak to me. Regardless, try your hand at the 'Test of Passion'. You'd better be quick.zts21378e	Yes. I will. (She seems very impatient.)zts21379e	(This is the Test of Passion. As Taitur said, I should be quick.)zts21380e	(I've passed the third test. Taitur will be surprised.)zts21381e	Act 7 - The Fourth Descendant of the Four Heroeszts21382e	Did you really pass it? Then you must be very strong. You've earned this. Now there's only one test left. Go to Asgothi in the Polluted Forest.zts21383e	I'm glad you recognise my power! I'll go to Asgothi now.zts21384e	Act 7 - Test of Wisdomzts21385e	Are you...zts21386e	Psssst... I know all about you. The loa told me. So you want to face the final test, the Test of Wisdom?zts21387e	How did you know that?zts21388e	The loa know everything and they share their knowledge with me. The Test of Wisdom is completely different to the other tests. May the loa be with you.zts21389e	In what way is this test different to the others?zts21390e	(At last, I've passed all four tests. Now I can fight the Beast King.)zts21391e	Act 7 - The Power of the Orc Heroeszts21392e	You did it!zts21393e	Did you know that beforehand as well?zts21394e	Of course. The loa told me.zts21395e	Why is nothing happening although I now have all four relics?zts21396e	They must be brought together as the Relic of the Great Orc Heroes. Only a warlock is able to do that. So go and see Pikidir.zts21397e	Okay. I'll go back to the village, then.zts21398e	Act 7 - Revengezts21399e	You're late! What happened?zts21400e	Yes. I've experienced a lot! (You tell him everything.)zts21401e	Is it true that you met the heroes' descendants and passed all the tests?zts21402e	Yes, it's true. Here you are. (You show him the four relics.)zts21403e	Very impressive! I will make the Relic of the Great Orc Heroes out of them. Wait a moment.zts21404e	(He utters a strange spell over the relics.)zts21405e	Done. If you use this, you can cleanse the Beast King. Go now.zts21406e	Yes. Thank you for your help.zts21407e	I can feel the heroes' power in this Relic of the Great Orc Heroes. Maybe I can really win this fight.zts21408e	Act 7 - It Is Donezts21409e	(I've finally defeated Carno. I should tell Ligtas. He will be very happy.)zts21410e	Act 7 - An Unexpected Resultzts21411e	I can't believe it! You did it.zts21412e	Yes. The power of the great heroes helped me.zts21413e	My chief will also be very pleased. Please tell him about it personally.zts21414e	Okay, I will.zts21415e	Thank you again for your service.zts21416e	Act 7 - Sudden Returnzts21417e	I would like to talk with the chief.zts21418e	Ah, the brave adventurer. You are our hero. You've saved our island. Thank you!zts21419e	My pleasure.zts21420e	Now you can return home.zts21421e	But I'd like to stay a little longer and help.zts21422e	We orcs will manage the rest on our own. We don't like strangers doing our work. It's a question of honour. I will be sure to reward you generously for your actions.zts21423e	Okay. I understand. I will comply with your wish and return home.zts21424e	Take my letter to Perkichan in the harbour. He'll take you home then. Farewell!zts21425e	Farewell, Propga.zts21426e	What do you mean? You're going again?zts21427e	Yes. Your chief has ordered me to leave the island. He said the orcs will take on what's left to do.zts21428e	He's probably right. Honour is very important to orcs. Nevertheless, we have you to thank for everything. Please accept this small gift as a thank-you from me.zts21429e	Thank you! Will we see each other again one day?zts21430e	Yes, I think we'll meet again.zts21431e	Do you want to go to NosVille? I happened to hear what you said.zts21432e	Yes. Please take me home.zts21433e	I guarantee you'll get home safely. Did you get a chance to try Cherry Apples?zts21434e	Not yet. Haha.zts21435e	But I said you should try them. Here you are. Try it.zts21436e	This ship will depart soon. Come aboard quickly!zts21437e	Act 7 - Sudden Returnzts21438e	(I'm pleased to be home again. But something's weighing on my mind. I need to know what's happened while I've been away. I should speak to Harbour Guard Tom first.)zts21439e	Act 7 - Small Gifts Make Great Friendszts21440e	Hello, how are you?zts21441e	You're back again from the new world? You haven't even been gone all that long?zts21442e	I wanted to stay longer but the island's ruler sent me back. The orcs wanted to see to the rest of their problems by themselves.zts21443e	I see. And, how did you like this new island?zts21444e	Apart form the monsters and demons, it's a beautiful island. There are interesting animals, plants and ores there. You should go there once all the monsters and demons have gone.zts21445e	Okay. I'll do that.zts21446e	The orcs gave me a few gifts to take with me. Do you know what these things are? (You show him what you've brought back from the island with you.)zts21447e	That all looks very interesting but I have no idea what it is. Why don't you ask Roram or the Akamur Merchants in Desert Eagle City? Maybe they will know.zts21448e	Hello, could you tell me what this is?zts21449e	Show me what you've got there.zts21450e	I've got all sorts of things. (You show him all of the items.)zts21451e	Hmm. Only one of the things seems familiar to me, namely this clay statue.zts21452e	Okay.zts21453e	The statue holds a very old magic. And it has a strange pattern. It's worth examining it more closely. Can I have it? I would pay for it, of course. How about 2,000 Gold?zts21454e	3,000 would be better.zts21455e	Okay. Then we have a deal.zts21456e	Thanks. (Damn, I should have named a higher price.) Off to the Akamur Quarter next.zts21457e	Hello, I've brought back a few strange items from a new island.zts21458e	I've heard. Do you mean the island in the East?zts21459e	Yes. You already know about it? The orcs from the island gave me a few things as a gift.zts21460e	Okay. May I have a look at these orcish items?zts21461e	Here. (You show the items.)zts21462e	Hmm. I'm interested in the gold coins. They're very attractive to collectors. How about 5,000 Gold?zts21463e	The gold coins were worth more on the island. I was thinking more of 8,000 Gold.zts21464e	How about 6,000, then?zts21465e	7,500 would be better.zts21466e	7,000 Gold is my final offer.zts21467e	Okay. Very well.zts21468e	That was a good deal. Tell me, are there many valuable resources on the island?zts21469e	There are delicious fruits, new types of animals, and minerals that are stronger than iron there.zts21470e	If that's true, I would gladly trade with the inhabitants.zts21471e	Unfortunately, that's not possible at the moment because there are still lots of demons and monsters causing trouble there.zts21472e	Oh, really? I hope the situation on the island stabilises as soon as possible. And where are you off to next?zts21473e	I don't have anything to do at the moment. I should go to NosVille and rest a bit.zts21474e	I see. Well, have a good rest in the city.zts21475e	(I'm back in NosVille. I've missed the city.)zts21476e	(I still have a few orcish items. Are orcish weapons and armour valuable? Teoman Topp might know.)zts21477e	Hello, how are you?zts21478e	Oh, long time no see. Where have you been?zts21479e	I was on Moritius Island. Orcs live there.zts21480e	Lords? Noble folk?zts21481e	No, orcs. They're a mysterious tribe. I've got weapons and armour from them. You're interested in such things, aren't you?zts21482e	Show me the weapons and armour. I can't imagine they're better than my works.zts21483e	(You give Teoman the weapons and armour.)zts21484e	Hmm. The style is very coarse. But they're very functional.zts21485e	What do you mean?zts21486e	Their construction is more lavish and practical than it appeared at first glance. It's worth examining them more closely. But they don't measure up to my works, of course.zts21487e	I see. Then take them all. I don't need them anymore.zts21488e	Oh, really? Fantastic! Thanks. Here's a little something in return.zts21489e	Thank you! Maybe you could also make use of a panacea from Moritius?zts21490e	I don't drink such strange potions. But maybe Malcolm Mix would be interested.zts21491e	You could be right. Bye for now.zts21492e	Hello, I've got a mysterious potion from the island in the East.zts21493e	Oh, may I see this potion?zts21494e	(You give him the panacea.)zts21495e	Hmmm... well, yes...zts21496e	Is it a real panacea?zts21497e	Never.zts21498e	Really?zts21499e	It's watered down. It won't have the slightest effect.zts21500e	Oh... Then I've been taken for a ride. What's it made of, then?zts21501e	I reckon fruit, moss...zts21502e	Ah, so it's a kind of drink. I'll drink it.zts21503e	W... Wait.zts21504e	(You've drunk the potion.) Oops. The taste was strange.zts21505e	The potion also contains the urine of an unknown animal.zts21506e	Seriously?! Ugh! Why are you only telling me this now? I'd better quickly eat something sweet after that. Bye!zts21507e	Act 7 - Matters of Urgencyzts21508e	Hello, I'm looking for something tasty to eat.zts21509e	Welcome. There's lots of delicious food here. Where have you been lately? I haven't seen you for a while.zts21510e	I've just come back from a new island called Moritius.zts21511e	Oh, maybe you brought me back a present? Hehe.zts21512e	Wait... I've got one of the local specialities. Here you are. (You give her a Cherry Apple.)zts21513e	I've never seen an apple like this. Does it taste sweet?zts21514e	Yes, very sweet and a little sour. It's called a 'Cherry Apple'.zts21515e	Thank you! I'll try it later. You can have a few dishes for free in return.zts21516e	Thank you! I should eat something tasty to get rid of the taste in my mouth.zts21517e	Oh, I forgot to tell you something. Mimi Mentor was looking for you a while ago. She looked as if it was urgent.zts21518e	Mimi Mentor? Then I had better go to her.zts21519e	You've received an express letter from Mortaz. I think it's about something urgent.zts21520e	Thank you! Who sent me this letter, I wonder? (You open the letter and read it.)zts21521e	It's from Propga: 'Some terrible things have happened to me. My son Licapga has disappeared. Lots of people have disappeared, but this is the first time it has happened to a child. I already asked our chief for help, and he sent out the guards to search for Licapga. But they didn't find my son. You are my only hope now. Please help me!'zts21522e	Oh, that really is urgent. I must go to Mortaz Desert Harbour.zts21523e	I understand. Take care.zts21524e	Thanks. Bye!zts21525e	(I've arrived at Mortaz Desert Harbour. I should find Propga before anything else.)zts21526e	Act 7 - Licapga Is Missingzts21527e	Hello, Propga. Is it true what you wrote to me about?zts21528e	Oh. I've been waiting for you. Thank you for coming. Yes, unfortunately it is true.zts21529e	We've no time to lose. Tell me everything on the way.zts21530e	Yes. Hurry!zts21531e	Okay. Let's go.zts21532e	Yes. Hurry!zts21533e	(We're back on Moritius Island. I need to know exactly what happened.)zts21534e	Act 7 - The Search for Licapgazts21535e	Can you describe to me in a bit more detail what happened with your son?zts21536e	It was about two weeks ago... We were supposed to deliver fish to the village that day. Loading the fish boxes on to the carts took longer than usual and it was already getting dark. As there weren't so many monsters, thanks to you, we decided to deliver the fish at night. Licapga insisted on coming along. I was against it at first, but I allowed him to in the end. The majority of the journey was safe. But when we turned onto the Woodland Path, merlings, sirens and satyri appeared, wanting to take our fish. I ordered Licapga to hide, and fought the monsters together with our guards. Eventually, we had defeated them all. But then I noticed that Licapga had disappeared. We searched the entire forest for him, but we couldn't find him. I should never have allowed him to accompany me.zts21537e	Don't blame yourself. He's bound to be somewhere safe. I'll go to the Woodland Path and look for tracks.zts21538e	Thank you very much. I'll wait here in case my son comes back on his own.zts21539e	Yes. That's a good idea.zts21540e	(I'd better look around for clues relating to Licapga first.)zts21541e	(There are a few small footprints here. It's clear that they belong to Licapga. But there are also larger footprints here, too. Whose can they be? Someone must have been with Licapga.)zts21542e	(I've found footprints belonging to Licapga and someone else.  Where were they going, I wonder?)zts21543e	(Perhaps they were heading to the Spirit Forest. I'm worried about him as the spirits are still dangerous.)zts21544e	(Based on the tracks, I assume that the unknown person knows where the spirits are.)zts21545e	Act 7 - The Entrancezts21546e	(This doll looks like Licapga's. Why has he come so deep into the forest?)zts21547e	(There are no more footprints here. He must be close by. I'll have a look around here as soon as I've defeated the spirits blocking my way.)zts21548e	Act 7 - Into the Unknownzts21549e	(There's a crack with a draft coming from it near the ground. It must be a secret door. I'll just go through it.)zts21550e	Act 7 - The Strange Prisonzts21551e	(Why are orcs standing guard here? That's strange. Anyway, I've got to find Licapga.)zts21552e	Are you Licapga?zts21553e	Yes. Who are you?zts21554e	I'm a friend of your father's. Let's get out of here.zts21555e	Thanks. But there are more of us here.zts21556e	We'll talk about that later. Enemies are approaching.zts21557e	Okay. Please rescue them later.zts21558e	Yes. I promise.zts21559e	Act 7 - The Truth about the Prisonzts21560e	At last, we're out of the cave. Let's go to Propga before the strange orcs come.zts21561e	Act 7 - A Helping Handzts21562e	Dad!zts21563e	Oh, thank the heavens! Are you okay, son?zts21564e	Yes. Your friend is very strong. He saved me.zts21565e	You saved my son's life.  Thank you, I appreciate it.zts21566e	You're welcome. Oh, by the way, there's a cave in the forest that's being used as a prison. It's being guarded by orcs. Licapga was held there, and there are more prisoners.zts21567e	Yes, I know. My aunt and uncle who live in the house next door are also locked up there. The orcs there beat them.zts21568e	That means... that some orcs are communicating with the demons.zts21569e	Yes. I think so, too. If it's true, I won't manage all of them alone. I'll need help. But we can't trust anyone in the village. Not even your chief.zts21570e	Who's going to help us, then?zts21571e	Ah! The heroes' descendants are independent of the village. Or not?zts21572e	That's right. All that interests them is their training and the safety of Moritius.zts21573e	Yes. I'll ask them for help. First, I'll go and see Taitur not far from here.zts21574e	Taitur, we need your help.zts21575e	Forget it. I've got enough to do fighting the monsters and demons.zts21576e	Some orcs are in cahoots with the demons and are kidnapping your people.zts21577e	Really? That's nasty. Where are they?zts21578e	Deep in the Spirit Forest.zts21579e	Datitus is responsible for that region. How could he let this happen? Let's go.zts21580e	Wait! The monsters and demons are coming!zts21581e	Damn it! We need to take care of them first.zts21582e	Yes. With our powers combined.zts21583e	I'll go straight to the prison. Bring the others here.zts21584e	Yes. Understood.zts21585e	I need your help, Asgothi.zts21586e	Is this about the Spirit Forest?zts21587e	Yes. So you know already. But why haven't you mentioned the prison?zts21588e	I didn't know because the loa didn't tell me. That means even the loa haven't picked up on it. The prison must be protected by powerful magic. Only high-ranking angels or demons, as well as the Demon God, can use this magic. As demons are spreading across our island, the Demon God could be behind it.zts21589e	That sounds logical. But first we have to rescue the people in the prison.zts21590e	You're right... Wait! Can you feel this strange energy, too?zts21591e	Yes. I can feel a very unpleasant energy.zts21592e	It's a kind of binding magic! I can't move an inch. What about you?zts21593e	I can move. What should I do?zts21594e	Demons have left magical objects here to bind me. Find and destroy them.zts21595e	Understood. I'll hurry.zts21596e	(I've destroyed all of the strange objects. Hopefully Asgothi will be able to move again.)zts21597e	Can you move now?zts21598e	Yes. Great work! Thank you for your help. I'll go to the prison now.zts21599e	Okay. I'll ask Cottari and Datitus for help.zts21600e	Cottari. We have serious problems.zts21601e	Get your breath back first. What's happened?zts21602e	Some orcs are joining forces with the Demon God and demons. They've kidnapped people from the village and locked them up in the Spirit Forest. We must rescue the villagers.zts21603e	That's really nasty. Let's go right away.zts21604e	Hmm? Where's the smoke coming from?zts21605e	My animals are getting restless. The smoke is obviously making them aggressive.zts21606e	Please find out what's causing the smoke and put a stop to it. I'll try to calm my animals down.zts21607e	Understood. Be careful until I get back.zts21608e	I've destroyed all the Obelisks of Evil. Are Cottari and his animals safe?zts21609e	I've destroyed the sources of the smoke.zts21610e	Great work! My animals are back to their normal selves. Thanks.zts21611e	You're welcome. Now there's just one more person I need to go and see. Let's go to Datitus together.zts21612e	Datitus! We're in trouble.zts21613e	Taitur and Asgothi have already told me. I'm sorry that I didn't foresee this.zts21614e	It's not your fault.zts21615e	We need to rescue the people and then find out who put the traitors up to it.zts21616e	Yes. Come on, let's go!zts21617e	Wait. The spirits have quite suddenly become even more aggressive. They can sense the energy of the Demon God at the prison. It doesn't look like we can avoid fighting the spirits.zts21618e	True. We need to break through the spirit ranks.zts21619e	Now we can get past.zts21620e	Yes. Let's hurry.zts21621e	Act 7 - Rescue Missionzts21622e	The people should be inside here. Quick, we've got to rescue them.zts21623e	Okay. Hurry!zts21624e	There seem to be a lot of opponents here.zts21625e	And I can feel the life force of a lot of people over there.zts21626e	We've rescued the orcs. Now let's get back to the entrance quickly.zts21627e	I'm afraid that's not possible.zts21628e	Why not?zts21629e	The entrance is sealed with strong demon energy.zts21630e	Which direction should we go, then?zts21631e	Fresh air is coming from somewhere. There has to be another entrance. Follow me.zts21632e	Act 7 - The Chief's True Colourszts21633e	Why are you here? I instructed you to go back home to give you a chance to survive. You shouldn't have come back. Guards! Kill them all!zts21634e	Oh my god! The chief's behind it all. We have to defeat him. And then we'll listen to what he's got to say.zts21635e	Act 7 - Defeating Belialzts21636e	It's over, Chief Tator.zts21637e	You can't be the mastermind behind such a big conspiracy. So who is it?zts21638e	That's true. You're not capable of wielding magic so powerful that we can't recognise it.zts21639e	Damn it! Now I'm in a tight spot! Is it over? Okay. I will tell you everything before I die. On the day the sky tore open, countless demons came to our island. One of the demons was the Demon God Belial. The chief at the time, Urgos, fought bravely against him. But he couldn't withstand Belial's strength for long. Despair rose up inside me. It was clear that Belial would lead our people and our island to ruin. And suddenly I had an idea.  I stabbed Urgos in the back to help Belial.  In doing so, I swore my loyalty to the Demon God. And in return, Belial promised to spare the village and its inhabitants.zts21640e	I see. And why did you have the villagers kidnapped, then?zts21641e	That was necessary for our safety. I had to offer Belial a few people as sacrifices.zts21642e	Otherwise our island would have gone up in flames. I've got nothing more to say. I know that I'm guilty, and that I've betrayed Urgos and all the others. Kill me now.zts21643e	No, I won't do that. On the contrary, I think that, as chief, you should try to reclaim the island for all the orcs.zts21644e	Huh? I don't understand what you mean. We're all going to die. Belial will come soon if no sacrifices are brought.zts21645e	As he said... defeating Belial will be difficult because he's just so strong.zts21646e	But in order to save the whole island, we must defeat him.zts21647e	What? It's impossible to defeat Belial. I looked for a way but he's so incredibly powerful.zts21648e	I can sense what his weakness is.zts21649e	What? His weakness? Then you mean...zts21650e	Before anything else we need to get out of here. Masses of demons and monsters are advancing.zts21651e	That's true. I hate the darkness here.zts21652e	Okay. Then let's get out of here.zts21653e	Act 7 - Not Even Gods are Infalliblezts21654e	So, what do you know about Belial's weak spots?zts21655e	I was able to eavesdrop on a conversation between Belial and his demons. In order to regain his power, he needs special marks. They are the Marks of Evil, Wrath and Greed. He has ordered the demons to erect the marks on the island. If the marks are destroyed, Belial will be weakened.zts21656e	Where are these marks?zts21657e	In the Polluted Forest, on the Forest Cliff and on the North Beach. To remove the marks, you'll need the opposing essences. You can obtain these essences from monsters and demons in this area.zts21658e	So first I have to get the essences.zts21659e	Exactly: the Corrupted Essences of Purity, Generosity and Serenity can become the Flawless Essences of Purity, Generosity and Serenity. You can destroy Belial's marks with the flawless essences.zts21660e	Okay. That's as easy as I expected. I'll set off, then.zts21661e	Take care.zts21662e	(The Mark of Evil is next. I should remove it from there first.)zts21663e	(I can destroy the Mark of Evil using the Flawless Essence of Purity.)zts21664e	(My next target is the Mark of Greed. For that I need the Corrupted Essence of Generosity.)zts21665e	(I can destroy the Mark of Greed using the Flawless Essence of Generosity.)zts21666e	(And last of all, the Mark of Wrath. For that I need the Corrupted Essence of Serenity.)zts21667e	(Now I have the Flawless Essence of Serenity and can destroy the Mark of Wrath with it.)zts21668e	Act 7 - Duel Against Belialzts21669e	(I've destroyed all of the marks. I should return to Tator now.)zts21670e	I've destroyed all of the marks. Where is Belial?zts21671e	You'll find him on the ground floor of the Celestial Spire. My warriors are guarding the entrance. To get inside, you'll need a certain seal.zts21672e	How do I get this seal?zts21673e	All of Belial's followers carry one. You can have mine.zts21674e	Here you are. Now go to the entrance. I have already instructed my guards to let you pass.zts21675e	I'll fight against Belial now.zts21676e	You're our only hope.zts21677e	Act 7 - Godslayerzts21678e	(I'm on my way to the last battle. Just how strong can Belial be?)zts21679e	Foolish human! I will make these stupid orcs into my soldiers and become ruler of the world. Whoever tries to stop me will die!zts21680e	A mortal human... I'm an immortal demon. I'll be back!zts21681e	(It's done. But it seems to me that Belial isn't dead once and for all. Anyway, Moritius is safe once again.)zts21682e	Act 7 - Saviour of the Orcszts21683e	So you really survived? Then that means Belial is dead?zts21684e	Yes. It was a long and hard fight but I won in the end.zts21685e	Thank you very much. You are the hero of our island.zts21686e	You've called me that once already. I like your sincerity. But Belial said that he will be back one day.zts21687e	Hmm... We should prepare ourselves for that eventuality.zts21688e	Yes. I agree.zts21689e	So... are you going back to NosVille? If you stay here a bit longer, I'll treat you like a hero every day.zts21690e	Well... I'd like to look around the island some more.zts21691e	Does that mean you're staying? Then I'll put on a celebration for you.zts21692e	Ah! Could you go straight to Pikadir? He would like to talk to you in private.zts21693e	Yes. No problem.zts21694e	Oh, here comes the saviour of the orcs.zts21695e	Haha, you're embarrassing me. Why did you want to speak to me?zts21696e	I'm assuming Belial said something before he died? Am I right?zts21697e	Yes. How did you know that?zts21698e	Powerful demons like Belial never really die. As soon as he gets a new body, he'll be back.zts21699e	What can we do to prevent his return?zts21700e	I have no idea. But, either way, he'll have to get used to a new body.zts21701e	Then I will defeat Belial again.zts21702e	With Belial weakened, we would cope on our own. But I'll let you know if he comes back.zts21703e	Act 7 - Kidnapped Orc Manzts21704e	You're free. Get out of here.zts21705e	Thank you for your help. I'm going back to the village now.zts21706e	Act 7 - Kidnapped Orc Womanzts21707e	Hello, Propga. How are you?zts21708e	Oh, it's you. What brings you here?zts21709e	Not enough fish have been delivered to the village. I wanted to see why.zts21710e	Yes. I thought so. My fishermen disappeared after fishing. I looked for them but couldn't find them. It's all a mystery to me.zts21711e	Where were they fishing? I'll check there first.zts21712e	On the South Beach. Hopefully you'll find them.zts21713e	The Missing Treasure Hunterszts21714e	Have you seen a ship from the West around here?zts21715e	I'm not sure, lots of ships come to this harbour.zts21716e	The ship I'm talking about is different from other ships.zts21717e	Hmmm... Do you mean the shipwreck?zts21718e	Shipwreck?zts21719e	Yes, about a month ago, a ship was wrecked on the South Beach. Two men, who looked like you, survived the accident.zts21720e	(They must be the two treasure hunters.) Where are they now?zts21721e	They're living in a tent on the beach. I left them in peace because they're not dangerous.zts21722e	Do you know them?zts21723e	They're friends of an acquaintance.zts21724e	We're So Hungry!zts21725e	Are you a treasure hunter with the Akamur Merchants?zts21726e	Oh, you're not an orc. I never thought I would come across a human here. Yes. I'm a treasure hunter.zts21727e	I'm glad I've found you. Harbour Guard Tom asked me to look for you.zts21728e	I see. I'm overjoyed he was worried and sent you.zts21729e	How did you end up here, anyway?zts21730e	Together with my brother Orus, I found an old treasure map in NosVille. This island was marked on the map in the East, but not the sea route leading to it. So we took a guess and set sail. After a few months at sea, we were hit by a violent storm and were shipwrecked. When I came to my senses, I was looking into the eyes of an orc. His name was...zts21731e	Perkichan, right?zts21732e	Oh. That's right. He told us that our ship had capsized and we were the only survivors. And he told us about this island.zts21733e	Perkichan suggested we go back to NosVille. But we can't do that because we've made too great a loss.  So we decided that we would only go home once we've found the treasure.zts21734e	And? Have you found it?zts21735e	Not yet. That reminds me... You don't happen to have something to eat, do you? I'm so hungry.zts21736e	No, I'm afraid I don't have anything with me.zts21737e	Could you do me a favour, then?zts21738e	I think I can guess what it is. Do you want me to bring you something to eat?zts21739e	You're very clever. Yes, please bring me something to eat.zts21740e	I see. I'll see what I can do.zts21741e	Letter to a Friendzts21742e	(That's enough. I'll take the fish to Irus now.)zts21743e	Here, I've brought you some fish.zts21744e	Oh, thank you so much. I'm not a particularly good cook, so I'll give them to my brother. And I've written a letter to Tom. Could you send it, please?zts21745e	Very well. I will.zts21746e	Perkichan, could you do me a favour?zts21747e	I should think so. Oh, what kind of letter is that?zts21748e	It's from one of the treasure hunters to his friend. Could you take it to Mortaz Desert Harbour in NosVille?zts21749e	Of course. Just not today. I still have an awful lot to do. As soon as I have time, I'll see to it. The treasure hunter gave me this Obsidian. You can have it. I don't need it.zts21750e	Perfect for Trainingzts21751e	(That's enough monsters.)zts21752e	I'll bring you what you wanted.zts21753e	Thank you! Now we can perfect our training some more. Here, a thank-you gift.zts21754e	Oh, you shouldn't have. Thank you!zts21755e	Pre-emptive Strikezts21756e	(That's enough. Litatiz will be relieved.)zts21757e	I'm done.zts21758e	Thank you, I appreciate it. Now they won't attack our village for a while. If there are any more monsters, I'll let you know.zts21759e	Yes. Let me know.zts21760e	Recognitionzts21761e	(I've collected all the weapons. Off to Logotor with them.)zts21762e	Convincing a Fatherzts21763e	Here you are.zts21764e	You were very quick! Thanks. I'll repair them. Please wait a moment.zts21765e	(She repairs the weapons.) Done.zts21766e	Could you take them to my father and convince him?zts21767e	Okay. Don't worry about that.zts21768e	A Back-Handed Complimentzts21769e	Welcome, stranger. What brings you here?zts21770e	Hello, Chief. I'm here about Logotor.zts21771e	So you've met my daughter. How is she doing?zts21772e	Fine. Though she's desperately seeking your approval.zts21773e	Approval? She'll get it once she's a warrior.zts21774e	But she would like to have your approval as a blacksmith.zts21775e	Stop! Don't interfere with my family's affairs.zts21776e	I would never do that. But take a look at these weapons.zts21777e	What sort of weapons are these?zts21778e	They were left behind on the farm. But she repaired them and now they're as good as new. She's already as good as NosVille's blacksmith.zts21779e	Hmm. She really is good. I have to agree with you on that.zts21780e	But if she doesn't make progress very soon, I'll force her into military training.zts21781e	Yes. I'll pass the message on.zts21782e	How did it go?zts21783e	He recognised your talent as a blacksmith.zts21784e	Really? I'm glad I trusted you.zts21785e	He has one condition, though.zts21786e	If you don't make progress soon, he will force you into military training against your will.zts21787e	Then I've got to really make an effort now. Thank you for everything.zts21788e	You're welcome. You can do it. Be confident. See you.zts21789e	Wait. I have something else for you. That's a Black Titanium Bar.zts21790e	I can't accept it. Your master, Martas, will be furious with you if he's missing materials.zts21791e	Don't worry. He'll understand. Besides, he always says that good deeds must be rewarded.zts21792e	I see. Thank you!zts21793e	The Mysterious Treasure Chestzts21794e	Oh, it's you. Orus has told me about you. What can I do for you?zts21795e	Orus is wondering where the key is. He thinks you might know.zts21796e	Before I answer, I'd like to ask you something. Are you strong?zts21797e	Yes. I think so. Why do you ask?zts21798e	The key is in a cave. But I can't just go and get it because there's also a huge creature living in the cave.zts21799e	What sort of creature?zts21800e	I have no idea. I've only seen a large silhouette holding a spear in its hand.zts21801e	Is that why you haven't told Orus anything about it?zts21802e	Yes. He's very hot-tempered. If he knew where the key was, he would go there without a second thought.zts21803e	I understand. I'll defeat the monster and fetch the key.zts21804e	Really?zts21805e	Of course. Wait here.zts21806e	I'd better defeat the Large Merling first and then look for the key. Just what is this merling doing here?zts21807e	A Disappointing Resultzts21808e	I've found the key! I'd better take it to Orus now.zts21809e	Here's the key.zts21810e	Oh. Is that really the key? Where was it?zts21811e	In a cave.zts21812e	What? But the cave isn't far from here at all. Why didn't Irus say anything about it?zts21813e	There was a large, dangerous merling in the cave. I defeated him.zts21814e	Irus always worries about me. I would have knocked the merling down with single blow.zts21815e	But it doesn't matter, we've got the key. Give it to me, please.zts21816e	I'm so curious about what might be in the chest.zts21817e	We'll see as soon as I've opened it. (Orus opens the chest with the key.) Wah! What's that, then?zts21818e	What?zts21819e	Just a couple of old letters. It's probably someone's time capsule. We've failed! I need treasure!zts21820e	Then... are you staying here?zts21821e	Of course. I'm still going to make a great find here.zts21822e	Haha. Then good luck!zts21823e	Thank you for everything. Here, this is for you. Now we're quits.zts21824e	Thanks!zts21825e	Moss Porridgezts21826e	What is it?zts21827e	I cut the moss myself. Take it to my wife, Rochapgi. She will cook something using the moss.zts21828e	Moss Porridge for Old Boneszts21829e	Hey there, stranger. What brings you here?zts21830e	Tudotito asked me to bring you this moss.zts21831e	Oh... I apologise for my husband.zts21832e	That's okay. It wasn't that difficult. But what are you planning on doing with the moss?zts21833e	I'm cooking a porridge with moss and vegetables.zts21834e	That sounds very unusual. Where I come from, moss is neither cooked nor eaten.zts21835e	Moss also doesn't really taste very good. Please wait a moment.zts21836e	(When is this porridge going to be ready?)zts21837e	The porridge is ready. Here you are.zts21838e	Oh, is this the Moss Porridge? It looks tastier than I expected.zts21839e	And it's very healthy to boot. Please take the Moss Porridge to Tudotito before he gets angry.zts21840e	Yes.zts21841e	A New Lease of Lifezts21842e	Here's your porridge.zts21843e	Okay. Mmm... tasty! Very good! But there's too much for me alone. Help yourself.zts21844e	Erm, no thank you.zts21845e	Whippersnapper! This is a sign of my appreciation. So have some!zts21846e	Very well. Thanks. I'll have half a bowl of porridge, then.zts21847e	Distant Bridgezts21848e	(I've defeated the monsters near the bridge. Now I ought to inform Litatiz.)zts21849e	I'm done.zts21850e	Thank you, I appreciate it. Now the Forest Cliff will be safe for a while. But more monsters will certainly follow. Would you help us again when they do?zts21851e	Of course, just let me know.zts21852e	Regional Delicacieszts21853e	(I've got all the ingredients. Ituros will be pleased.)zts21854e	You were very quick! Thanks!zts21855e	Don't mention it.zts21856e	Here is your reward. Would you help me again next time?zts21857e	Your reward was very generous. Just let me know if you need any help.zts21858e	Fernon's Crystalzts21859e	Asgothi, I'd like to hear your opinion.zts21860e	Let's hear what you want to know.zts21861e	Churisgo has found a new way of increasing the loa's power using tattoos. She doesn't know which material would be suitable for it, though. Would you know the right material?zts21862e	The loa possess various elemental powers. But there are only two essences: light and shadow. So you need a material that contains two elemental powers.zts21863e	Could you explain it in a bit more detail?zts21864e	You won't find such a material on this island. But there is the world of winged creatures. The ones with the black and white wings have magic powers. If you bring me the material, I can use it to produce a magic crystal for the tattoos.zts21865e	But who are the ones with the black and white wings?zts21866e	You've defeated these monsters once already.zts21867e	Ah, now I see. Incomplete Fernons have black and white wings. Thanks for the tip! I'll come back with the material.zts21868e	(I have the Magical Fernon Powder now. I'll bring it straight to Asgothi.)zts21869e	Advanced Runic Carvingszts21870e	May I ask you something, esteemed warlock?zts21871e	Be my guest. What do you want to know?zts21872e	Martas has come up with a new way to enhance weapons that involves decorating them with runes. He wants to use them to enhance the weapons' magical powers. The first few attempts have failed, however. Do you know why?zts21873e	I suspect it's the catalyst that's the problem.zts21874e	Yes, that's what Martas said too. So what sort of thing makes a suitable catalyst?zts21875e	Unfortunately, the appropriate magical material isn't found on our little island. We'll need something of equal power to the runes if we're going to use their ancient power properly. And only angels and demons have access to that sort of power.zts21876e	Angels and demons? Heh, then I know what needs doing. I'll go to Felice. Thank you!zts21877e	I hope you find what you're looking for.zts21878e	Can you feel the power of the runes?zts21879e	Hmm, a little.zts21880e	That power grows each time I carve the rune.zts21881e	All right. I'll come back later.zts21882e	Howling Monsterszts21883e	(I've destroyed so many howling monsters. Everything seems quiet now.)zts21884e	I've driven out the monsters.zts21885e	Yes, finally some peace and quiet. Here, a little thank you for you.zts21886e	Oh, that's not necessary.zts21887e	Nonsense, I won't be needing it any more. Besides, it's too heavy for me. Take it already.zts21888e	In return I shall come to you for help if the howling starts up again.zts21889e	Easy Fishin'zts21890e	(Phew, there were certainly a lot of mermen and sirens there! I think it's best if I bring the fish to Propga.)zts21891e	Here's the stolen fish. And I also dealt with the monsters for you.zts21892e	Thank you! Now our people can fish in peace again. Here's your reward!zts21893e	I'll know who to turn to if there are too many monsters at the South Beach again.zts21894e	Defend the Farm!zts21895e	(Hmm, it's odd to see this many Trolls and Potato Goblins these days. I hope I managed to solve the Orcs' food problem.)zts21896e	There were quite a few Trolls and Potato Goblins at the farm. But I've dealt with it.zts21897e	Oh, that's great news - thank you! I'm sure it won't be quiet there for very long.zts21898e	Then I'll just have to show them what's for again!zts21899e	Round 2 Against the Beast Kingzts21900e	(Carno is back to his senses. I should tell Cottari.)zts21901e	Carno is better!zts21902e	Well done! He's still quite groggy, however. I'll look after him and keep an eye on how he's doing.zts21903e	Round 2 Against the Spirit Kingzts21904e	(The Spirit King is well again. I should tell Datitus.)zts21905e	The Spirit King is back to his senses.zts21906e	Excellent! Peace reigns in the Spirit Forest once more. I'll see to it that it stays that way.zts21907e	Please call on me if something like that happens again.zts21908e	Of course - I can rely on you!zts21909e	Belial's Returnzts21910e	(Phew, that fight was tough. I unfortunately didn't manage to destroy Belial's soul. He'll return in a new body, I'm sure of it.)zts21911e	I've defeated Belial again.zts21912e	You are a true hero! So... did you destroy his soul as well?zts21913e	I didn't manage to do that, no.zts21914e	We must find a way to destroy him for good.zts21915e	Hopefully we can think of something soon.zts21916e	I'll do everything I can. Will you apprehend Belial again when he returns?zts21917e	Of course!zts21918e	I have injected the material with loa energy, as the loa instructed us to. The crystal now contains the power of Fernon... and the power of the loa!zts21919e	Great! I'm excited to find out what it can do.zts21920e	If you need the crystal again, just come talk to me. The loa has told me to keep helping you.zts21921e	Thank you! I need to go to Churisgo now.zts21922e	Here is the Fernon's Rough Magic Crystal.zts21923e	Gosh, I can feel the powerful magic flowing through it. And the power of the loa! Yes, this is the right crystal.zts21924e	Excellent, please keep it.zts21925e	Hold on a second... (She's doing something to the crystal.) Right, I've made the rough crystal into two functioning crystals.zts21926e	I'll keep one, and you can have the other. And here are some Black Titanium Bars too.zts21927e	Thank you! I'll certainly find a use for these.zts21928e	Can I borrow your crystal... just in case I need it?zts21929e	Of course, no problem.zts21930e	(I've collected the Magical Fernon Powder. I'll go to Asgothi and ask her how to make the Fernon's Rough Magic Crystal.)zts21931e	Here, I've made the crystal.zts21932e	Thanks for the help!zts21933e	The Divine Crystalzts21934e	Hello! I'd like to ask you something.zts21935e	Be my guest. What can I do for you?zts21936e	Is there an ore or a jewel that has the magic power of high-ranking angels or demons?zts21937e	Hmm, no idea - but I've heard of a crystal that radiates with immense power.zts21938e	Really? Tell me more.zts21939e	It's called the Magic Divine Crystal.zts21940e	And where can I find it?zts21941e	You'll have to defeat Erenia and Zenas to collect some Magic Goddess Powder. Then you use that to make the crystal.zts21942e	So I'll need to fight them... Okay, I'll come back when I've defeated the goddesses.zts21943e	(I've defeated the goddesses and collected the magic powder. Now the alchemist Felice can craft the crystal.)zts21944e	A crystal? Right away!zts21945e	It wasn't easy, but I've done it. Here's the crystal.zts21946e	If you need any more of these crystals, just bring me more of this powder. I'd like to thank you, actually. I've learned quite a lot about new powers from crafting that crystal.zts21947e	Yes, I'll do that.zts21948e	Here's the crystal you need.zts21949e	Wow, excellent work! Let's see... Oof... I can feel the intense power inside this crystal. Where did you get it?zts21950e	From Cylloan. It wasn't easy.zts21951e	Thank you. I'm sure you could use runes to make it even more powerful. (He starts working the crystal.)zts21952e	Alright, I've split the crystal. I'll keep one half, and you can have the other.zts21953e	Can I have your crystal... just in case I need it?zts21954e	The Magic Divine Crystalzts21955e	(I'll go to Felice and make a rough crystal.)zts21956e	(I should bring the Rough Magic Divine Crystal to Martas.)zts21957e	No Potion, No Motionzts21958e	Thank you for your help. Our stock of potions was really getting low.zts21959e	It was my pleasure. If you need any more, please let me know.zts21960e	Oh, really? Alright, I will. Thanks again!zts21961e	Materials for a New Spellzts21962e	Here's everything you'll need.zts21963e	Oh, thank you! May I come to you again the next time I need new materials?zts21964e	Of course.zts21965e	Scorpion Poisonzts21966e	Here's the Scorpion Poison.zts21967e	Thanks a lot, this should be enough for a while. I'm sure we'll need more at some point. There are just too many monsters. May I come to you again the next time I run out of poison?zts21968e	Of course.zts21969e	Here's everything you wanted. Can you stop Belial from reincarnating?zts21970e	I fear this will only stop it from happening for a while. Belial's followers won't allow it. That's why we must continually fight them back. Can I ask you for help later if I need it?zts21971e	Of course I'll help! If Belial returns my home will be in danger as well, after all.zts21972e	Beast Bloatzts21973e	Thank you! Our village is safe again, at least for a while. Will you stand with us again the next time the monsters overwhelm us?zts21974e	I'm ready whenever!zts21975e	Wrath of the Spiritszts21976e	Thank you! You've thinned out the ranks of the spirits. But that won't last forever. Can we count on you to help when more spirits attack?zts21977e	Keep the Forest Cleanzts21978e	Thanks a lot, adventurer! You've thinned out the ranks of the monsters and demons. But I'm sure they will be back to full force soon enough. Will you help us again when that happens?zts21979e	The Magic Crystal's Creationzts21980e	Thanks for the help. Here's your part of the magic crystal.zts21981e	Oh, thanks.zts21982e	I'll seek you out again sometime.zts21983e	Conversation In Time-Space 93zts21984e	Oi, you there! It's dangerous here. You should leave!zts21985e	I've come here to defeat Carno.zts21986e	(Hmm, I can feel the adventurer's power. Perhaps...) Well, it looks like I can't persuade you otherwise. So I'll come with you. And if it gets too dangerous, we'll run away - got it?zts21987e	Okay. Then it's time to give Carno what for!zts21988e	Thank you! Here's your part of the crystal. I'll talk to you if I need it later.zts21989e	Conversation with Ligtaszts21990e	Scorpion Poison (Daily Quest)zts21991e	(Damn it, we're already running out of poison.)zts21992e	Hey, can I help you?zts21993e	Oh, just in time. Yes, I could use some help.zts21994e	What's wrong?zts21995e	Did you know that Redeye Scorpion Venom is especially potent?zts21996e	Yes. I've felt it run through my own body before.zts21997e	Then you must know how it works. It's deadly when used on monsters and demons. That's why we use poison on our weapons. Unfortunately, we're running out of supplies.zts21998e	I see. So you want me to get you some more supplies?zts21999e	Yes. You can get the poison out of the Redeye-Scorpions' stingers.zts22000e	Okay sure, I'll take care of it.zts22001e	Conversation with the Training Guardzts22002e	Perfect for Training (Side Quest)zts22003e	Aren't you the adventurer that came from the West?zts22004e	Yes, pleased to meet you.zts22005e	I have a request. We're training as hard as we can to prepare ourselves to fight monsters and demons. But a stationary straw dummy will never be the same as the real thing. It doesn't hit back, for one. So, would you catch us some Pikanyas and Screeching Wingworms to use instead? They'll be perfect for training with. I'll also have a little reward for you.zts22006e	Absolutely, I can manage that.zts22007e	Sorry, I'm too busy at the moment.zts22008e	Conversation with Litatizzts22009e	Choose a daily quest.zts22010e	Preemptive Strike (Daily Quest)zts22011e	Distant Bridge (Daily Quest)zts22012e	Defend the Farm! (Daily Quest)zts22013e	I'm the guard captain on Moritius. It's hard work, but I'm happy to do it.zts22014e	Monsters are pouring out of the Polluted Forest! Get ready!zts22015e	What's the matter? Are we being attacked by monsters?zts22016e	Yes. They just keep coming. I fear we do not have enough guards to hold them off.zts22017e	Why don't we turn the tables and attack them first?zts22018e	Hmm, it's not the best idea, but it could work.zts22019e	Alright, then I'll take the fight to the monsters!zts22020e	Really? Oh, thank you. Best of luck!zts22021e	Damn it! Everyone, retreat!zts22022e	Yes, Sir!zts22023e	Oh, you're just in time! Monsters have seized the bridge at the Forest Cliff. The guards up there were overrun.zts22024e	And I don't have any reinforcements to send them. The other warriors are needed to defend the village.zts22025e	I'M your reinforcements. Don't worry, I'll take care of this.zts22026e	Are you going to the rebuilt farm?zts22027e	I don't know yet. Why do you ask?zts22028e	The farm looks spick and span now, but we have more problems. Trolls and Potato Goblins are trying to get into our crops. Our farmers are scared for their lives, and worried that the monsters will eat all the crops.zts22029e	And you want me to defeat the monsters, correct?zts22030e	Yes, there's no end to them. You just need to deal with enough of them so that we can keep the rest at bay by ourselves. Will you help us?zts22031e	Of course, for the good of the villagers.zts22032e	I would, but I have business elsewhere.zts22033e	Conversation with Logotorzts22034e	Recognition (Side Quest)zts22035e	Hey, aren't you the adventurer that came from the West?zts22036e	Yes. Do you need any help?zts22037e	Yes. I'm Logotor, Chief Tator's daughter.zts22038e	Pleased to meet you.zts22039e	I've always wanted to become an armourer, but my father is against it. He wants me to become a great warrior and be his heir. But making weapons is such an amazing job!zts22040e	You're right, there. And it's an important one too. Hmm, looks to me like you're already an armourer.zts22041e	I just do what I feel like. Even if I'm not on the best terms with my father, it would still mean a lot to me to have his blessing. But how will that ever happen?zts22042e	Just show him what you can do. Then he'll see for himself that making weapons is your calling. It might be a good idea, right?zts22043e	Hmm, I suppose it's worth a try. But I don't have any Black Titanium I can use.zts22044e	That just makes your plan even better. That way you can show him that you can still do your work in the most adverse circumstances.zts22045e	Hmm, I see. Hehe, I just thought of something! There are loads of chests of broken weapons at the abandoned farm to the South. Bring them to me and I'll repair them. I'm sure that will impress my father.zts22046e	Great idea! I'll bring them to you.zts22047e	I'm Logotor, Chief Tator's daughter. And making weapons is the best job in the world!zts22048e	Conversation with Oruszts22049e	The Missing Key (Side Quest)zts22050e	Hey adventurer!zts22051e	Me and my brother finally found the treasure chest!zts22052e	Oh, really? Congratulations! So where was it?zts22053e	You won't believe it. It was buried right underneath our tent!zts22054e	So now what? Are you going to NosVille?zts22055e	Not yet. First we have to find out what kind of treasure is inside that chest. But it's locked, and we don't have the right key for it. I tried breaking it open, but all I managed to break were my tools. It's probably sealed with magic as well.zts22056e	Then we have to find the key. Do you have any idea where it could be?zts22057e	My brother Irus was looking for it while I tried to break open the chest. Ever since he got back I've had the feeling that he knows something about the key, but he doesn't seem to want to tell me. Maybe you could ask him?zts22058e	Okay, I'll ask him.zts22059e	I'm looking for treasure on behalf of an Akamur merchant. My search lead me here... Although the shipwreck didn't really leave me much choice.zts22060e	Conversation with Tudotitozts22061e	Howling Monsters (Daily Quest)zts22062e	Creaky Hinges (Side Quest)zts22063e	(Boohoo, I hurt all over! And this howling is driving me up the wall.)zts22064e	Hey, whippersnapper! Come over here.zts22065e	Of course, Elder. What can I do for you?zts22066e	The howling coming from the forest every night is keeping me awake.zts22067e	Yes, I've heard it too.zts22068e	When you're my age, a proper night's sleep is the be-all and end-all. Not enough sleep and us old folks might pop our clogs, don'chaknow! Will you deal with the problem in the Polluted Forest?zts22069e	Yes, of course.zts22070e	Hey, whippersnapper! C'mere!zts22071e	Hmm? Do you mean me?zts22072e	Who else could I mean?! You need to do something for me.zts22073e	My old bones have been aching so fiercely lately. That's why I went looking for a witch. She told me that to eat plenty of moss.zts22074e	Seriously? I doubt that will actually help.zts22075e	Bah, witches always know the best home remedies! Have a bit of respect, whippersnapper! Well, go and get me some moss then. Collect it by defeating Moss Gloops and Moss Fairies in the Spirit Forest.zts22076e	(Well, he's in a mood!) Of course, Elder, that's no problem.zts22077e	Sorry, but I'm busy.zts22078e	Conversation with Churisgozts22079e	Needle and Ink (Side Quest)zts22080e	Brave adventurer, could you do me a favour?zts22081e	I'm looking for new ways to improve my tattoos. But I just don't know what to try next.zts22082e	What's the problem?zts22083e	Our mages want to use tattoos to make the power of the loa even stronger. We got the idea from watching you perform magic. We've tried out various magical materials, but nothing has worked so far.zts22084e	Do you know why?zts22085e	Not exactly. It seems like there might not be enough magic. The materials we have on Moritius are only slightly magical, after all. Do you happen to know where we could find any more suitable material?zts22086e	Hmm, no idea.zts22087e	Maybe Asgothi would know. She's very close to the loa, after all. Could you ask her about it please?zts22088e	Sure, I'll do that.zts22089e	I'm too busy. Maybe later.zts22090e	No Potion, No Motionzts22091e	Materials for a New Spellzts22092e	Hey adventurer! Could you do me a favour?zts22093e	The ongoing battles against the monsters have depleted our supply of potions. Could you get me a few Orc Moss Potions?zts22094e	Of course, no problem.zts22095e	I'll bring you the potions later, okay?zts22096e	Hey adventurer! Sorry, but I need your help.zts22097e	I'm researching a new spell that will protect us from monsters. But I'm missing the correct material component for it.zts22098e	What do you need?zts22099e	You'll find everything I need in the Beast's Lair: Owlbear Manes and Redeye Scorpion Poison. Could you get them for me?zts22100e	Yes, I'm on my way.zts22101e	Sorry, but I'm busy. Maybe later.zts22102e	Please ask me anything you want to know about tattoos.zts22103e	What are tattoos, and how do I get one?zts22104e	What do tattoos do?zts22105e	Tattoos are pictures of loa that are painted under the skin using needles and ink. Marking yourself with the power of the loa allows you to use certain skills.zts22106e	Ah, I see. So how do I get one of these tattoos?zts22107e	First you'll need a design. There are four different designs: Bear Loa, Lion Loa, Snake Loa, and Eagle Loa. If you bring me one of these designs and the right materials, then I can give you a tattoo.zts22108e	Does each design have its own effect?zts22109e	That's right. The bear loa increases your defence and the fire element, the lion loa your attack and the light element, the eagle loa your dodge, your hit rate, and the water element, and the snake loa your magic and the shadow element. You can also upgrade your tattoos.zts22110e	Tattoos let you use powerful loa skills. The skills just have a long cooldown before you can use them again.zts22111e	Sounds good. Can you tell me anything else about each of the skills?zts22112e	Each loa increases either your attack, defence, or one of the other stats, plus an element. The skills are more effective if you use them in combination with one another, or by meeting certain requirements.zts22113e	Can I also get attack skills from tattoos?zts22114e	Of course. Each loa comes with an attack skill. Each skill's attack is modified by a specific stat.zts22115e	Tell me more about that.zts22116e	The Bear Strike is modified by the melee defence stat of the person that uses it, the Lion Strike by the dodge stat. Hit rate affects the eagle loa's damage, and magic defence modifies the snake loa.zts22117e	Back to the First Pagezts22118e	All right. Thank you!zts22119e	Brave adventurer, I need more Magic Fernon Crystals. Can you help me?zts22120e	Yes, I'll bring you some.zts22121e	Sorry, I'm too busy right now.zts22122e	Conversation with Propgazts22123e	Off to Moritius!zts22124e	Ready? Let's take a shortcut to Moritius.zts22125e	Yeszts22126e	Nozts22127e	I have come from an island far to the East to find a powerful hero to aid us.zts22128e	Conversation with Ituroszts22129e	Regional Delicacies (Daily Quest)zts22130e	Hello, adventurer. Do you have time to talk to me?zts22131e	Sometimes people come from the West to taste the local delicacies. Cherry Apple and Owlbear Meat are both especially popular.zts22132e	Oh, you must love the sound of the cash register!zts22133e	Yes, I can't complain. Although we're running low on supplies.zts22134e	And you want me to go get these supplies, right?zts22135e	Haha, you're sharp as a tack! Yes, would you pick up some Owlbear Meat and Cherry Apple for me?zts22136e	Of course, I'm on it.zts22137e	I'm responsible for making sure this village is kept well fed. But our food supplies are running low. Damn it, if only we had as much food as we have monsters attacking us!zts22138e	Conversation with Martaszts22139e	Advanced Runic Carvings (Side Quest)zts22140e	The Magic Divine Crystal (Daily Quest)zts22141e	Do you have time to talk to me?zts22142e	We need more powerful weapons if we're going to withstand the growing hordes of monsters and demons. That's why I've developed a new method of carving runes.zts22143e	In theory, when I carve runes into magical ore or gems it should enhance the spirit energy. However, so far none of my tests have gone very well - the runes are less powerful than I expected them to be.zts22144e	What's causing it?zts22145e	I think it's the material I'm using. It's just not magical enough. But I don't know much about that sort of thing. Maybe you could ask Pikidir the warlock for advice?zts22146e	Yes, I'm sure we can manage it together.zts22147e	I'm busy right now, but I'll come back later.zts22148e	I make all sorts of equipment in my work as a blacksmith. It's a lot of work, and I could do with more apprentices. So, what can I do for you?zts22149e	What are runes exactly, and how can I carve them?zts22150e	What do runes do?zts22151e	A rune is an ancient kind of letter that contains powerful magic. If you carve it into a weapon you can imbue it with magic powers. Of course, you never know what kind of power you'll unleash.zts22152e	How many different powers do runes have?zts22153e	According to some sources there are 15 different powers. We only know about ten of them so far. But I'm sure we'll find out more about the others.zts22154e	Ah, I see. So how do you carve a rune?zts22155e	You can only use them on main weapons. Each rune requires 6 materials. Each weapon can be enchanted a maximum of 15 times. You can give your weapon new powers each time you enchant it.zts22156e	Okay. And can it have a maximum of five powers?zts22157e	No, each weapon can have a maximum of two powers.zts22158e	What happens to the weapon if something goes wrong?zts22159e	If carving the rune goes wrong then it can leave your weapon damaged. But don't worry - the weapon won't be destroyed. The materials will just be consumed. If your weapon gets damaged you can mend it again using the Rune Anvil. Or you can just wait 5 hours.zts22160e	All right. Thanks for explaining.zts22161e	I've destroyed all the Obelisks of Evil. Is Cottari safe?zts22162e	I've destroyed the sources of the strange smoke.zts22163e	Yes. (25,000 Gold)zts22164e	That's right. The bear loa increases your defence, the lion loa your attack, the eagle loa your dodging and the snake loa your magic. You can also upgrade the tattoos.zts22165e	With a tattoo you can use powerful loa skills. You can use the skills again after a long cooldown. They will also cost you less mana then.zts22166e	Each loa increases either your attack power, defence power, or other stats as well as an element. Additionally, there's a chance of unlocking a special skill.zts22167e	Of course. Each loa grants an attack skill. With the power of the loa, you inflict more damage on your opponents.zts22168e	When rune carving fails, it can damage the weapon. But don't worry: the weapon won't be damaged; only the materials are consumed. If the weapon is damaged, you can repair them on the Rune Anvil. Only then will you be able to add new runes to the weapon.zts22169e	The higher the level of the rune, the more power it gives the weapon. You can add new rune powers at levels 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. Additionally, certain abilities are enhanced.zts22170e	What are rune powers?zts22171e	When you attack an opponent, there's a chance of the power of the rune being activated and meteors or snowstorms being summoned, for example.zts22172e	Could you bring me the Magic Divine Crystal again? I need to equip the guards' weapons with runes.zts22173e	Conversation with Propgazts22174e	Easy Fishin' (Daily Quest)zts22175e	I need your help, adventurer.zts22176e	Of course, no problem.zts22177e	Thank you! Our fishermen may have been able to go about their work again since you defeated the Large Merling, but they keep being attacked by monsters stealing their catch.zts22178e	Do you mean those monsters on the South Beach?zts22179e	That's right! Could you destroy the monsters on the Waterfront and bring back the stolen fish?zts22180e	Of course, I'm on it.zts22181e	I hope our fishermen are able to work in peace one day. Maybe that'll be possible eventually.zts22182e	Conversation with Tatorzts22183e	Demon Hunt (Daily Quest)zts22184e	Can you help me, adventurer?zts22185e	With joined forces we were able to overcome Belial, but his minions are still infesting this island. The warlock and I fear that they are gathering dark energy in order to resurrect Belial. Please could you stop them? If you bring me Signs of the Demon, I will reward you handsomely.zts22186e	Okay, I'll take care of it.zts22187e	I am Chief Tator and I rule over Moritius island. The safety of my people is of great importance to me.zts22188e	Conversation with Cottarizts22189e	I am Cottari, descendant of the Beast Overlord. Together with my animal companions, I fight against the monsters on this island.zts22190e	We've got a big problem, adventurer!zts22191e	The Beast King Carno fears that he could be corrupted by evil again, so he's asked me to keep an eye on him. However, he disappeared a few days ago.zts22192e	So you're afraid that the Beast King has been manipulated by evil forces again?zts22193e	I'm sure he won't surrender without a fight, but he won't be able to resist it alone. We have to help him.zts22194e	I agree.zts22195e	So would you help the Beast King?zts22196e	Can you help me, adventurer?zts22197e	The monsters in the Beast's Lair are multiplying rapidly. This poses a huge threat to our village. Would you decimate the monsters' ranks?zts22198e	Yes, I can do that.zts22199e	Conversation with Datituszts22200e	Welcome, stranger. I am Datitus, descendant of the orc crusader. I keep watch over this island with the power of holy light.zts22201e	Do you have a moment, adventurer?zts22202e	As I'm sure you know, I protect the Spirit Forest. Unfortunately, the spirits are behaving very aggressively at the moment.zts22203e	Hm, could it be that the Spirit King has been corrupted again?zts22204e	Yes, but he seems to be fighting back against it so we can still save him! Would you go to him and purify him?zts22205e	Ah, there you are. I have a request.zts22206e	What is it?zts22207e	There are more and more aggressive spirits, so nobody dares enter the forest any more. Could you take action against the violent spirits and reduce their numbers?zts22208e	Of course. I'll take care of it before it becomes a problem.zts22209e	Conversation with Pikidirzts22210e	Belial's Return (Daily Quest)zts22211e	Oh dear, we've got a big problem. He has been resurrected!zts22212e	Are you talking about Belial?zts22213e	Yes. He has returned in a new body, just as I'd feared. However, he still isn't used to his new body and hasn't regained his full power, so we have a chance against him. Would you help us again and save our island?zts22214e	I'm warlock Pikidir. The warlock is subordinate only to the chief, so I am his deputy.zts22215e	Conversation with the Family Managerzts22216e	Travel to Mortaz Desert Harbourzts22217e	Travel to Port Alveus Squarezts22218e	Do you want to travel to Mortaz Desert Harbour?zts22219e	Do you want to travel to Port Alveus Square?zts22220e	Yes. (30,000 Gold)zts22221e	I am Perkichan, the Harbour Guard of Moritius. Pleased to meet you. Our island is actually a beautiful paradise, but the many monsters are making life hard for us right now.zts22222e	Conversation with Merchant Ben (Mortaz)zts22223e	Cause for the Arrival (Main Quest  Act 7)zts22224e	Travel to Port Moritiuszts22225e	Do you want to travel to Moritius island? Are you sure?zts22226e	Conversation with Asgothizts22227e	Keep the Forest Clean (Daily Quest)zts22228e	I'm Asgothi, descendant of the powerful Voodoo Priest, and I have Curse Power.zts22229e	Don't worry, I won't curse you. May the loa be with you.zts22230e	I have a job for you, adventurer.zts22231e	What is it?zts22232e	Belial has been defeated and Obelisk of Evil in the Polluted Forest has been destroyed. However, the number of monsters and demons is increasing. If it carries on like this, they will soon overrun our village. Could you reduce their numbers?zts22233e	Conversation with Taiturzts22234e	Conversation with Lisukazts22235e	Conversation with Kachantrokzts22236e	I'm just a simple farmer and... I want nothing more than a plentiful harvest.zts22237e	Conversation with Kujeantrokzts22238e	My brother is very timid and doesn't speak to others much. That worries me.zts22239e	Conversation with Tatiruszts22240e	I've found out why the forest is contaminated, but I can't solve the problem alone. Hopefully, a strong warrior will help me...zts22241e	Conversation with Iruszts22242e	I am Irus, the brother of Orus, and a passionate treasure hunter. I'm a little worried as my brother is a bit of a hothead.zts22243e	Conversation with Rochapgizts22244e	Ah, my poor, old husband. He's always worrying about something. That's not good for his health.zts22245e	Conversation with Tarituszts22246e	I'm the village gatekeeper. I don't let any suspicious-looking people past.zts22247e	My husband Logtas is one of the village guards. He always volunteers for the most dangerous duties and is very proud.zts22248e	Conversation with the Guardswomanzts22249e	Celestial Spire Ground Floor Entrancezts22250e	The Celestial Spire is an extremely dangerous place. You can only enter it with the chief's permission.zts22251e	You may only pass if the chief has given you permission.zts22252e	Oh, the chief has allowed you to enter the tower? Then of course you may pass.zts22253e	Entrancezts22254e	Conversation with the Spirit King's Altarzts22255e	(Wow, the altar is huge. What is it used for?)zts22256e	Moritius NosBazaarzts22257e	After Propga left, the Celestial Spire was eventually completed. Then the sky became dark and, all of a sudden, countless demons and monsters appeared.  I quickly went and hid on the boat. When things calmed down, I came out again and saw that many of us were dead.zts22258e	I heard that the chief had died fighting a demon. Of all the orcs that were at the tower, only a single warrior survived. That was Tator, and he's now our chief.zts22259e	Yes, the sorcerer infused the magical spear with the power of the loa. And then Urgos thrust the spear into the sky. We were expecting rain to fall from the sky, but demons and monsters fell to earth instead. They spread quickly over the whole island. How stupid we were!zts22260e	And then a huge demon appeared, who seemed to be their leader. Urgos fought with all his might against this demon. In the end he defeated it but he, too, was mortally wounded. He ordered me to withdraw... and then he died. The rest of us tried to flee. We fought through the ranks of enemies blocking the stairs. Once I reached the bottom, I realised I was the only survivor.zts22261e	His name is Logtas. We were both investigating why the forest is contaminated. At some point we found a cave that was radiating a lot of evil energy. It became clear to us that it was the cause of the contamination. We tried to force our way in and investigate further, but we had to retreat because this awful energy from the depths of the cave was stronger than us. During the retreat, Logtas and I got separated.zts22262e	I wanted to go back into the cave and look for him, but then a whole horde of monsters appeared suddenly. I was so afraid that I ran away. I behaved like a coward and I'm ashamed that I left him behind. Please rescue him!zts22263e	It's from Propga: "Something terrible has happened to me. My son Licapga has disappeared. Lots of people have disappeared, but this is the first time it has happened to a child.zts22264e	I already asked our chief for help, and he sent out the guards to search for Licapga. But they didn't find my son. You are my only hope now. Please help me!"zts22265e	It happened about two weeks ago... We were supposed to deliver fish to the village that day. Loading the fish boxes on to the carts took longer than usual and it was already getting dark. As there weren't so many monsters, thank to you, we decided to deliver the fish at night.zts22266e	Licapga insisted on coming along. I was against it at first, but I allowed him to in the end. The majority of the journey was safe. But when we turned onto the Woodland Path, Merlings, Sirens and Satyri appeared, wanting to take our fish.zts22267e	I ordered Licapga to hide, and fought the monsters with our guards. Eventually, we had defeated them all. But then I noticed that Licapga had disappeared. We searched the entire forest for him, but we couldn't find him. I should never have allowed him to accompany me.zts22268e	Damn it! Now I'm in a tight spot! Is this the end? So be it... I will tell you everything before I die. On the day the sky tore open, countless demons came to our island. One of the demons was the Demon God Belial. The chief at the time Urgos fought against him bravely. But he couldn't withstand Belial's strength for long.zts22269e	It was clear that Belial would lead our people and our island to ruin. And suddenly I had an idea.  I stabbed Urgos in the back to help Belial.  I swore my loyalty to the Demon God. And in return, Belial promised to spare the village and its inhabitants.zts22270e	Together with Irus, I found an old treasure map in NosVille. This island was marked on the map in the east, but not the sea route leading to it. So we took a guess and set sail.zts22271e	After a few months at sea, we were hit by a violent storm and were shipwrecked. When I came to my senses, I was looking into the eyes of an orc. His name was...zts22272e	I'm the guardian of the Beast's Lair. This area is very dangerous at the moment, so we're not letting anybody in.zts22273e	I'm Taitur, descendant of the fire druid. If you have nothing important to say, please leave. I'm busy.zts22274e	Commotion in the Celestial Spirezts22275e	Welcome, adventurer. Litatiz has told me about you.zts22276e	What has happened to the secret agents?zts22277e	I'm afraid I don't know, but I've not received a report from them in quite some time.zts22278e	And the noises from inside are getting louder and louder. I don't like it at all.zts22279e	I see. I'll take a look around inside the Spire then.zts22280e	That's extremely dangerous... but I suppose nothing can unsettle Belial's slayer, huh?zts22281e	(There are many corrupted orcs prowling around here. I should defeat them, and perhaps I'll find some information.)zts22282e	Spy Reportzts22283e	(Hm, a part of the secret agents' report. If I find the other parts, I'll be able to piece them together.)zts22284e	What's Going on There?zts22285e	Oh good, you've come back unscathed! Did you find the secret agents?zts22286e	I'm afraid not. But I did find pieces of their report.zts22287e	Not bad. It must have been written by their leader. Please show it to me.zts22288e	 Content of the Report zts22289e	There has been lots of activity lately in the Celestial Spire. Belial's followers have been up and down between the basement and the top floor a lot.zts22290e	But I've got no idea what they're doing up there.zts22291e	It may be dangerous, but I will instruct an agent to follow them each day.zts22292e	 End of the Report zts22293e	None of the agents I sent to the top floor has returned. There's only me left now. I will find out what they're up to if it's the last thing I do!zts22294e	On my honour, I will do it!zts22295e	It seems all of the agents are dead...zts22296e	But they didn't die in vain; they fulfilled their task. At any rate, we now know that something's going on in the Celestial Spire.zts22297e	I agree, but we need more information. Please would you report to Tator? Meanwhile, I will confer with my soldiers.zts22298e	Whoa, you're in a hurry!zts22299e	There's news from the Celestial Spire. Belial's army is up to something on the top floor.zts22300e	Unfortunately, the agents who found this out have all fallen. We should honour their memory and forge plans.zts22301e	Their deaths will not have been in vain, I swear! We have to find out what's going on there.zts22302e	We're still missing some important information. Perhaps it's a trap and they're trying to lure us into the Spire.zts22303e	What's the plan?zts22304e	We need to put together a task force and gather some more information.zts22305e	And we need your help for that.zts22306e	The Lost Reportzts22307e	Thanks! We'll surely be able to obtain more information from the pieces of the report. I'll be in touch when I need you again.zts22308e	Commotion in the Celestial Spire (Side Quest)zts22309e	The Lost Report (Daily Quest)zts22310e	Although Belial has been defeated, the number of his followers in the Celestial Spire continues to grow. I have sent my secret agents to gather information. They sent regular reports at first, but it's been a while now since I received the last one.zts22311e	Could you get to the bottom of this? The guards outside the Celestial Spire will be able to tell you everything else.zts22312e	Okay, I'm on it.zts22313e	The agents' reports are probably still inside the Spire. Every little snippet could be important. Would you take the pieces of the report from the corrupted orcs in the Spire?zts22314e	Of course, I'll bring them to you.zts22315e	Gathering Information (Side Quest)zts22316e	We need to steal the orders from Belial's followers to obtain further information. Could you bring me Belial's Orders from his defeated followers?zts22317e	Of course, I'm on it.zts22318e	What's the story?zts22319e	I hear that you've been looking for me. What's the matter?zts22320e	Would you do me a favour? The New Year Bully Bushtail has stolen the Gift Bags and Lucky Charms I was planning to give to my neighbours.zts22321e	Could you keep a look out for the Stolen Gift Bags and Lucky Charms on your travels?zts22322e	Where will I find the New Year Bully Bushtail?zts22323e	You'll find the New Year Bully Bushtail while hunting monsters within your level range.zts22324e	But you'll have to be quick! Once it sees you, it'll turn tail and run rather than get dragged into a fight with you.zts22325e	If you bring me 5 Stolen Gift Bags and 5 Stolen Lucky Charms, I'll give you a New Year's Gift Box.zts22326e	Amora's Valentine's Dayzts22327e	Hellooo, <pname>!zts22328e	Would you like to help me spread love around the world to make it a more beautiful place? If not on Valentine's Day, then when? Hmm...?zts22329e	Helping me will fill your own heart with love. *wink*zts22330e	Yes, of course.zts22331e	Sorry, I'm busy.zts22332e	Valentine's Day Eventzts22333e	Ah! My heart is aflutter... Hurry back to Amora!zts22334e	Thank you so much! My senses tell me more love is in the air.zts22335e	But sadly, I'm running low on magic Cupid's arrows. Would you help me make new arrows?zts22336e	First, I need Magic Hearts. Strong monsters like to feed on them, but this reduces the love in the world.zts22337e	I'm sure they'll drop some if defeated.zts22338e	Now I have all the Magic Hearts. Head to Amora!zts22339e	Oh, you're done already? Wow, that's a lot of hearts! How exciting!zts22340e	For the arrow shafts, I need Rare Wood. Would you please bring me some?zts22341e	Lovely! That is just the wood I need.zts22342e	I... I have to tell you something. I'm a little embarrassed, but...zts22343e	I was on my way through the Maple Woods when... a horde of Wollets swiped the last of my Fairy Dust!zts22344e	But I absolutely NEED it to make my arrows. Can you get it back for me?zts22345e	That should be enough Fairy Dust. It's best I bring it to Amora right away.zts22346e	Oh, my! Just what have these Wollets done with my Fairy Dust?! It's not sparkling at all anymore! Look how dull it is... No, this won't do.zts22347e	I know! We simply need a few Golden Stamens.zts22348e	With them I can shine up this dust. Then it will twinkle like the stars!zts22349e	Thank you so much, <pname>!zts22350e	People are kind to one another and frolicking again thanks to you.zts22351e	Now I can resume my life's mission. Just hold stiiill... *Her whole face lights up.*zts22352e	*Amora aims the arrow right at your heart.*zts22353e	Descendant of the Fire Druidzts22354e	Welcome, <pname>! Unfortunately I have some bad news. And we really need your help.zts22355e	Take a look at these decrypted orders. Here.zts22356e	*You read the orders.*zts22357e	Hmm, we should block up the rift in the sky as soon as possible.zts22358e	Yes, definitely! Unfortunately I have no idea how we're supposed to achieve that.zts22359e	I understand there was a similar problem during the great war. The legends tell us that our ancestors foiled an invasion from Hellord through a rift in the sky.zts22360e	We need to find out if there's any truth to that legend.zts22361e	I agree. But there are no written records from that time. The legends of the great war have only been passed down orally.zts22362e	Maybe the descendants of the orc heroes who fought in that war know something more. Talk to Taitur first.zts22363e	So Many Demons!zts22364e	Taitur, we need your help.zts22365e	I need yours too! There are so many demons here, I can't deal with them all on my own.zts22366e	No problem, I'll help you.zts22367e	The Beast Overlord's Childrenzts22368e	So, that put paid to the demons.zts22369e	Thanks. I like to see people who value efficiency. So, what can I do for you?zts22370e	Could you tell me something of the great war? The legends say that the orc heroes drove back Hellord's demons that were streaming through a crack in the sky, and then sealed it up behind them.zts22371e	Hmm... I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to say anything about that.zts22372e	Why not? We need this information!zts22373e	We fire druids are forbidden from talking about the crack.zts22374e	That is our oath.zts22375e	I'm sorry, but I cannot help you. But maybe Cottari can tell you something.zts22376e	Fine. I'll go and talk to Cottari then.zts22377e	The Madness of Demonszts22378e	Cottari, we need your help.zts22379e	Hello, adventurer. You scratch my back first, and I'll see what I can do. I need your help too.zts22380e	While I was patrolling near the Beast's Lair, I discovered that the demons have secretly been erecting Obelisks of Evil.zts22381e	I tried to drive them out, but there are simply too many of them.zts22382e	We need to destroy the obelisks, before the evil power has a chance to spread.zts22383e	Okay, I can manage that. Where do I find the obelisks?zts22384e	Head to the southern end of the Beast's Lair. There's a broken altar nearby.zts22385e	All right. Leave it to me.zts22386e	Descendant of the Voodoo Priestzts22387e	I've defeated all the monsters and destroyed the Obelisks of Evil.zts22388e	Great work! Now it's my turn. What can I do for you?zts22389e	I'd like to learn more about the great war and the rift in the heavens. In particular, I need to know how it's possible to seal such a rift. I tried asking Taitur, but she said she's not allowed to say anything about it.zts22390e	Hmm... I'm afraid I can't help you there either. I only know that it is a taboo subject and no one is allowed to talk about it.zts22391e	Why will no one tell me anything? Even you are sworn to secrecy...?zts22392e	That's just the way it is. Maybe Asgothi can help you.zts22393e	Fine, then I'll go and ask Asgothi.zts22394e	Troublesome Stone Statueszts22395e	I need your help, Asgothi.zts22396e	Sorry, I'm too busy right now. My loa tells me those weird stone statues are back again.zts22397e	If you could destroy the horrible statues and wipe out the demons, I'll help you in return.zts22398e	Fine, just wait here.zts22399e	Descendant of the Orc Crusaderzts22400e	I've destroyed the statues and killed all the demons, Asgothi.zts22401e	Wonderful! Then how can I be of service?zts22402e	I'd like to learn more about the rift in the heavens during the great war.zts22403e	Hmm... sorry, but I don't know much about that. There are no written records from that time.zts22404e	Why not?zts22405e	I can only assume that the heroes who sealed the rift didn't want their story to be recorded.zts22406e	I've asked my loa about it, but he doesn't answer.zts22407e	Maybe the power required to seal the rift is too great to risk it ever falling into the wrong hands.zts22408e	Datitus might know more about it, why don't you ask him?zts22409e	That makes sense at least.zts22410e	Yes, I'll go and talk to Datitus.zts22411e	May the loas watch over you.zts22412e	Raging Spiritszts22413e	Datitus, I need your help.zts22414e	Oh, hello there, adventurer! Sure, we can talk, just as soon as you've helped me with my little problem.zts22415e	You see, this place has been invaded by demons.zts22416e	I've already defeated them, but the corrupting energy in their hearts has only transformed them into raging spirits. Could you banish them?zts22417e	Of course! I'll deal with it.zts22418e	(Monsters, demons and raging spirits everywhere you look. I only hope we're not too late...)zts22419e	The Offeringzts22420e	I've dealt with all the raging spirits.zts22421e	Thank you very much! Now the orcs can continue gathering materials in peace. So, now we have a little quiet. What did you want to talk to me about?zts22422e	Hmm... the Spirit King knows about all that. If you want to know more, you'll have to ask him.zts22423e	As I'm sure you know, you'll need to make an offering at the Spirit King's altar at the edge of the forest.zts22424e	Thanks, I'll make an offering.zts22425e	The Spirit King's Altarzts22426e	Oh, great Spirit King! I bring an offering. Please hear my call!zts22427e	I heard your pleas, mortal. What brings you here?zts22428e	I'd like to learn more about the rift in the heavens during the great war.zts22429e	Sealing a rift requires an unbelievable amount of power.zts22430e	Only very few are party to this knowledge, as power of that magnitude would be enough to bring about the end of the world, if it were to fall into the wrong hands.zts22431e	Hmm... Moritius and NosVille are in great danger.zts22432e	The demon hordes from Hellord will stream through the rift above the Celestial Spire, if it isn't sealed.zts22433e	And then Hellord's evil master will appear here eventually. We cannot allow that to happen! We must find this power and bring peace to the world!zts22434e	Well said. The time has come to unleash this power once more.zts22435e	The heroes of the great war predicted that the demons would try to conquer the world again, some day. That's why they perpetuated their story through the generations, so that it might never be forgotten.zts22436e	Long ago, the demons attacked the island of Moritius.zts22437e	Orcs, spirits and loas fought as one to fight off the demon assault and protect their homeland.zts22438e	The longer the war dragged on, the more hopeless the battle became. The demons corrupted everything they touched, and their power only grew.zts22439e	Four powerful loas passed their essence on to the strongest orcs, imbuing them with mighty powers: the orc heroes of legend.zts22440e	It was thanks to these four heroes that the tides were finally turned, and the demons could be surrounded.zts22441e	But then the demons opened the great rift in the skies. The masters of Hellord sent reinforcements to bolster their evil armies.zts22442e	Powerful demons streamed through the rift, and not even the heroes were capable of stopping such a gigantic army.zts22443e	The heroes knew they would have to seal the rift to have any chance of winning the war, and they begged the loas to give them the power they needed.zts22444e	The loas listened. Together with the orc heroes, they combined their power into a huge needle and mighty thread.zts22445e	But the loas paid a huge price for their actions. They gave everything to create the Needle and Thread of Holy Light, some even sacrificing their very being.zts22446e	Armed with these holy relics, the heroes cut through the demon hordes and ultimately sealed the rift. The war was won.zts22447e	So those are the items we need to seal the rift once again. Do you know where I can find them?zts22448e	Patience! The story is not over.zts22449e	The heroes feared that the needle and thread could fall into the wrong hands. That would spell the end of Moritius.zts22450e	Their first thought was to destroy them, but it was impossible; the power of the relics was too great. So they hid them, far, far from Moritius.zts22451e	So where did they take them to?zts22452e	The secret locations were engraved on a stone tablet.zts22453e	Well that sounds promising! And where is this tablet?zts22454e	The tablet is in my possession. But I will only grant it to the person who proves themselves worthy.zts22455e	You must pass my test. Only then will I grant it to you.zts22456e	I'll pass your test! For NosVille and Moritius!zts22457e	Ha! Your pluck is encouraging. Then let the test begin!zts22458e	The Spirit King's Testzts22461e	A Worthy Herozts22462e	I've passed the test. Right?zts22463e	I knew you'd manage.zts22464e	You step up to any challenge, no matter how difficult. I'm sure the needle and thread will be in safe hands with you.zts22465e	Here, take this. All the clues to the relics are engraved on this tablet.zts22466e	The Fields of Goldzts22467e	Let's see what this inscription says exactly.zts22468e	*The inscription on the stone tablet starts to glow.*zts22469e	Hmm... what does that mean? According to the tablet the needle is hidden...zts22470e	... in the Fields of Gold.zts22471e	Is that supposed to mean fields of wheat? No, that can't be right. Otherwise farmers would've discovered the needle sooner or later. That wouldn't have been clever.zts22472e	Maybe it's a reference to the desert. When the sand reflects the sun, it shimmers in a golden light. And nobody would go searching the desert for a needle.zts22473e	Right then. Perhaps I can find out more in Desert Eagle City.zts22474e	The Needle in the Sandszts22475e	As this is an ancient relic, I'm best off asking an archaeologist.zts22476e	Excuse me? I have a question.zts22477e	Yes, what is it?zts22478e	I'm looking for an ancient and powerful relic: the Needle of the Holy Light.zts22479e	Have you ever heard of it?zts22480e	Hmm... the Needle of the Holy Light? No, can't say that I have.zts22481e	But I heard a story once of four strangers who came to this place and secretly buried something in the sands.zts22482e	Four strangers...? Then I'm on the right track after all! Do you know of the lonely tree, standing in the desert?zts22483e	No, never heard of it.zts22484e	You should probably ask the merchants here. They regularly cross the desert on their trade routes. If anyone can help you, they're the ones.zts22485e	That makes sense. Thanks for your help! I'll ask the merchants next.zts22486e	Greetings, dear customer! What can I do you for?zts22487e	I need some information.zts22488e	Of course, of course! The customer is always king. What do you need to know?zts22489e	Do you know anything about a giant needle or a lonesome tree around here somewhere?zts22490e	I don't know anything about any needles, but there is tell of a mysterious tree.zts22491e	Really? Tell me more.zts22492e	Ha! You don't get anything for free in this life. Information has its price like any other commodity. I'll tell you all I know for the laughable sum of 100,000 Gold.zts22493e	Err... I'll have to think about it. (What an absolute shark! But what other choice to I have?)zts22494e	Here's your money. Now tell me what you know about this tree.zts22495e	Thank you, loyal customer! Right, let me see now.zts22496e	Somewhere in the desert there's a bare tree. But there's something unusual about it. Someone once approached that tree, and then - gone! Disappeared in an instant.zts22497e	What do you mean, 'disappeared'?zts22498e	Exactly that. Gone. Vanished. Like a drop of water soaked up by the sand.zts22499e	Maybe he stood on quicksand?zts22500e	Well... the only person who could answer that would be the man himself.zts22501e	Go to the Akamur Camp if you want to learn more.zts22502e	There's a merchant there who's travelled every inch of the desert. I'm sure he'll be able to tell you more.zts22503e	Thanks for your help! I'll set off at once.zts22504e	Hello! May I ask you something?zts22505e	Hello, adventurer. Of course, fire away.zts22506e	I've heard of a tree out in the desert that made a person disappear. Do you know anything about it?zts22507e	Oh yes, I know that story. Unbelievable, isn't it?zts22508e	Can you tell me where it happened?zts22509e	Hmm... maybe... if you do something for me first!zts22510e	Name it!zts22511e	Since we've been trading with Moritius, the demand for the rare ore Black Titanium has been on the rise in NosVille.zts22512e	Black Titanium is popular because of its extreme versatility. But it's also hard to acquire. Could you bring me a few fragments?zts22513e	Alright. But then you promise to tell me the full story, okay?zts22514e	Of course. You have my word.zts22515e	Here are the Black Titanium Shards you wanted.zts22516e	Wonderful! Well you kept your part of the bargain, let me do mine. Every Akamur Merchant knows of the tree in the northern desert.zts22517e	But we avoid it.zts22518e	In the northern desert? That makes sense. Then now I know.zts22519e	Oh really? Err, I mean... glad to hear it! Happy I could be of service. But just be careful! Nobody who has approached that tree has ever returned.zts22520e	The Quest for the Holy Threadzts22521e	Finally, I've found the needle! Now I just need the thread to go with it. Let's see, what clues do we have...zts22522e	*Search the abandoned temple at the furthest bounds of God's will.*zts22523e	*He who fears not the saints will find the thread to seal the rift.*zts22524e	Hmm... what could the 'furthest bounds of God's will' mean? Is that a reference to Mystic Heaven? Or Hellord?zts22525e	And the inscription says something about saints. So it really must have something to do with Mystic Heaven or Hellord.zts22526e	I guess the best place to start would be the Forgotten Archipelago, that's where they both are.zts22527e	Though I should probably go back to NosVille first and talk to Crusader Graham.zts22528e	Thread in the Skyzts22529e	I need your help, Graham.zts22530e	Long time no see! How can I help you?zts22531e	I'm looking for the Thread of the Holy Light. Apparently it's supposed to be found in an abandoned temple... at the 'furthest bounds of God's will', whatever that means.zts22532e	God's will? Well if that's supposed to refer to one of our goddesses, then it can only mean one place.zts22533e	Do you mean Ancelloan's Will?zts22534e	Yes, I think that's what is meant.zts22535e	And do you know where the abandoned temple is then?zts22536e	No, that doesn't ring any bells.zts22537e	Oh well, never mind. Thanks for your help anyway! Guess I'll head for Ancelloan's Will.zts22538e	I need to find this temple... maybe the Crusader knows something.zts22539e	Pardon me, I don't mean to bother you, but can I ask you something?zts22540e	Certainly.zts22541e	I'm looking for the Thread of the Holy Light. It's supposed to be in an abandoned temple around here. Do you know anything about it?zts22542e	An abandoned temple? No, can't say I do. But there are a few ruins around here. Particularly in Ancelloan's Will 2, there are a lot which have never been explored. Maybe you'll find what you're looking for there.zts22543e	I hope that helps. But could you also do me a favour? I have a little problem.zts22544e	Of course. What do you need?zts22545e	We Crusaders are fighting against some evil spirits entirely unknown to us. Many of our number are already wounded or dead. Could you help us fighting back these spirits?zts22546e	Sure, that's my speciality!zts22547e	(So, that's that. Better go back and tell the Crusader.)zts22548e	Hey, Crusader! I've defeated the spirits!zts22549e	Thank you! I can see there are a lot fewer spirits now that you've done your bit.zts22550e	It was nothing. Bye for now.zts22551e	Be careful! There are still many evil spirits on the road ahead.zts22552e	I'll investigate all the ruins here thoroughly.zts22553e	Hmm, not in there. Let's look at the next ones.zts22554e	Nope, no hint of the thread. Off to the next ruins!zts22555e	Ooh, there's something written on these ruins. I can't decipher the writings, but I feel some strange energy. I'll have to take a closer look.zts22556e	Woah, what's this?! A gateway appeared when I touched it! I bet I'll find the Thread of the Holy Light inside.zts22557e	Needle and Threadzts22558e	Finally, I have the needle and thread. Time to return to Moritius!zts22559e	Escape from the Spirezts22560e	Chief Tator, I've found the Needle and Thread of the Holy Light!zts22561e	Ha! I knew you'd manage! Now we can seal the rift in the sky.zts22562e	I'll head for the Celestial Spire.zts22563e	Wait! You can't enter the spire yet.zts22564e	I dispatched a number of orc soldiers to find out about Belial's plans, but only a few have returned.zts22565e	The demons seem to be getting more powerful.zts22566e	The few soldiers who came back were able to provide us with some information.zts22567e	What could they tell us?zts22568e	You need to talk to the warlock. He's looking after the wounded.zts22569e	Certainly, chief! I'll visit the warlock.zts22570e	The Solutionzts22571e	Hey, warlock, how are the soldiers doing?zts22572e	Hello, adventurer. Sadly, some of them have succumbed to their wounds.zts22573e	Oh, I'm very sorry.zts22574e	But at least they were able to deliver us some very important information. You know already about the power of evil?zts22575e	Yes, I fought against it on Moritius.zts22576e	That's right. Well there's another power in the Celestial Spire which is even greater.zts22577e	What's the difference exactly?zts22578e	The power you have confronted until now only strengthens the monsters and demons on the island.zts22579e	But the evil power in the Celestial Spire simultaneously weakens our troops.zts22580e	That means you also will be weaker in the spire. It would be a foolish mistake to go rushing headlong into there.zts22581e	But how are we going to seal the rift if we don't?zts22582e	Our soldiers have brought us a vital clue. It was only down to fortune that we were able to rescue anyone at all from the spire.zts22583e	You see, many of the soldiers have reared and trained wolves, and it was these loyal companions who rescued them.zts22584e	One of the soldiers reports that while he and his comrades were weakened, the wolves were actually strengthened under the influence.zts22585e	The wolves tore the demons to shreds, before rescuing their masters.zts22586e	Wow, that's amazing! But why did the wolves get stronger in the spire?zts22587e	I assume that this evil new power considers the wolves to be monsters. But I can't be sure. Either way, we should use this knowledge to our advantage.zts22588e	Yes, that sounds like a good idea. Why don't we try to neutralise the evil energy?zts22589e	Great idea! You'll need to neutralise it to enter the spire. I've already tried to extract it from the soldiers' bodies.zts22590e	Only the magic of the light loa has had any impact. But even with all my skills, I wasn't able to do it.zts22591e	We'll need more powerful light energy to neutralise it.zts22592e	And where will I find that?zts22593e	Talk to Asgothi. She knows all about the magic of the loas.zts22594e	Monsters in the Towerzts22595e	Asgothi, I need your help.zts22596e	Good that you're here. I need yours too!zts22597e	The strange statues in the Polluted Forest are boosting the power of evil.zts22598e	I bet they've been set up by demons.zts22599e	Destroy them first, then I will help you.zts22600e	Understood. I won't be long!zts22601e	The Obelisk of Lightzts22602e	Thanks. So how can I help you?zts22603e	I need powerful light energy to neutralise the power of evil in the Celestial Spire. Do you know where I can find that?zts22604e	Very wise of you to come to me! I've put a lot of thought into this evil power that's plaguing us.zts22605e	Ha, Asgothi always knows who to turn to! So what have you discovered?zts22606e	Light elemental magic is very effective against regular evil powers.zts22607e	But this evil is too powerful to be neutralised by a single spell.zts22608e	Do you know how or where to get the light energy needed to neutralise this evil?zts22609e	The Obelisk of Light is the key. It has the energy needed to break the evil.zts22610e	And where can I find this obelisk?zts22611e	Talk to Datitus in the Spirit Forest. He'll be able to help you.zts22612e	Raging Spiritszts22613e	Hello Datitus.zts22614e	Oh, hello there, adventurer! Sorry, don't have time to talk just now.zts22615e	So I see. You seem stressed.zts22616e	Can you help me? It's madness right now.zts22617e	What's wrong?zts22618e	The spirits are going crazy. The Spirit King seems to be the problem.zts22619e	But I can't get to him for all the spirits. Can you visit him for me?zts22620e	Sure thing, I'll pay the Spirit King a visit.zts22621e	Energy Transferzts22622e	Thanks a lot, adventurer! The spirits seem to have calmed down for now.zts22623e	What was it you wanted of me earlier?zts22624e	I've heard that the Obelisk of Light is strong enough to neutralise the power of evil. Do you know anything of this obelisk?zts22625e	Indeed I do. Unfortunately, it cannot be moved.zts22626e	Oh, that's no good. Is there no alternative? We need its light energy to save the world.zts22627e	Well, I can transfer the energy from the obelisk onto a totem. It won't be as concentrated, but it might be enough.zts22628e	That sounds promising. Where can I get a totem from?zts22629e	To craft a totem, you need Sekraz Ore, Jade, branches from the trees of the Spirit Forest, and Loa Runic Powder.zts22630e	Afterwards, we can transfer the light energy from the obelisk onto the totem using Holy Bone Powder.zts22631e	I need to perform a ritual to extract the powder near the Obelisk of Light.zts22632e	Can you deal with obtaining everything for the totem first?zts22633e	Certainly, I'll bring you everything you need.zts22634e	The Place for the Ritualzts22635e	The totem is ready. Now we just need the Holy Loa Bone Powder. I'll perform the ritual to extract the powder.zts22636e	The light energy will attract demons. You need to protect the obelisk while I perform the ritual.zts22637e	Okay, no problem... err, where are we going?zts22638e	We have to go to consecrated ground. Follow me.zts22639e	Guarding the Ritualzts22640e	So, here we are. I'll perform the ritual now, you protect the Obelisk of Light.zts22641e	Finally, the totem is complete.zts22642e	This will get you into the Celestial Spire. But remember, the totem is weaker than the Obelisk of Light.zts22643e	You must enter the spire alone. The totem can only protect one person. Make sure it doesn't get destroyed. And whatever you do, don't lose it! That would be the end.zts22644e	Understood. As long as my loyal pets and partners are with me, nothing can stand in my way.zts22645e	Let's only hope that they can get you to the roof of the tower safe and sound. You're our only hope.zts22646e	The Lower Levelszts22647e	Everything is prepared, chief. (You explain to the chief everything that has happened to now.)zts22648e	You did it! I knew you would! Sadly the evil energy in the spire is only getting strong.zts22649e	Oh no! Has the evil overlord already descended?zts22650e	Not yet. But there's not much time left to halt this invasion.zts22651e	Then I will get to work neutralising the evil energy in the lower levels immediately.zts22652e	Good plan. And good luck!zts22653e	I should probably let the chief know that I've secured the lower levels.zts22654e	Moving On Upzts22655e	I've cleared the lower levels.zts22656e	Good job, keep it up! Are you going to continue to the middle levels as well? I will assemble the troops ready for an attack.zts22657e	I should probably let the chief know that I've secured the middle levels.zts22658e	To the Pinnaclezts22659e	The middle levels are also secure now.zts22660e	Wonderful! I'll order my troops to bring the Holy Needle and Thread to the spire. In the meantime, you should neutralise the evil energy in the upper levels.zts22661e	I should probably let the chief know that I've secured the upper levels.zts22662e	The Final Battlezts22663e	The upper levels of the spire are secure now as well. Your soldiers can head to the top.zts22664e	All levels are secure? Excellent, then we can finally deal with the rift.zts22665e	Definitely. I'll seal the rift with the needle and thread.zts22666e	Hurry! Victory is close at hand!zts22667e	At Terror's Endzts22668e	Done it! I've closed the rift in the heavens and defeated the evil overlord.zts22669e	Bah! Don't rejoice too soon. My body is broken, but my soul is undying!zts22670e	Woah, demons really are a curse. You can't return to Hellord if I've sealed the rift, right?zts22671e	My soul will dwell in the Celestial Spire and radiate evil for all eternity!zts22672e	Sorry, I have bad news for you. I've already neutralised the tower of evil.zts22673e	Haha! My soul is pure evil. You cannot neutralise that!zts22674e	The power of evil will continue to grow, and there's nothing you can do to stop it!zts22675e	All NosVille will fall under an evil spell!zts22676e	Never! I will fight your evil to my dying breath, just like every other hero of this world. We will never give up until your soul is defeated!zts22677e	Oh really? Challenge accepted! Evil is back in the Celestial Spire! Mwuhahaha!zts22678e	For World Peacezts22679e	I've sealed the rift and defeated the evil overlord.zts22680e	Thank you. I'll withdraw my troops from the spire so they aren't overpowered by the spreading evil. What happened exactly?zts22681e	When I reached the roof, the evil overlord Paimon was already there. I quickly sealed up the rift, and then defeated Paimon.zts22682e	Paimon's soul cannot return through the rift, and now it's trapped here. He's locked himself in the Celestial Spire, and it's now haunted by his spirit.zts22683e	What? The Celestial Spire is cursed?zts22684e	Yes. Although I neutralised the energy before, it's back now and the whole Celestial Spire is corrupted by it. That's why the monsters and demons are getting stronger once again.zts22685e	So this was all for nought?zts22686e	No, we must continue to neutralise the energy. If we don't, the evil will only continue to spread.zts22687e	I see... then we orcs will ensure this can never happen! But we won't manage it alone. We'll need the support of all the heroes of this world.zts22688e	I agree.zts22689e	Anyone who wishes to challenge evil can enter the Celestial Spire via the gatekeeper. For glory, for honour... and to save the world, of course. That is the mark of a true hero!zts22690e	I will take on this challenge in time.zts22691e	To the Infinite Celestial Spirezts22692e	Hmm, the monsters in the spire are stronger than I expected. I should tell Tator.zts22693e	I have to tell you what I've seen in the spire.zts22694e	First, let me just say I'm glad to see you back unharmed. Now tell me what you found out.zts22695e	The monsters there are far more powerful than imagined. Also I was weakened by the power of evil there; it's too strong.zts22696e	You need strong partners and pets to reach the uppermost levels.zts22697e	I see. I will ensure that all challengers know of this. Thanks. Here, this is for you.zts22698e	What is it?zts22699e	This chest is for heroes who have completed the challenge of the spire. If you want more chests like that, you need to pay for them with Infinity Coins. There are lots of useful items inside.zts22700e	But you never know exactly what you'll get. Here, take it. As a small sign of gratitude for your efforts.zts22701e	The Celestial Spire Challengezts22702e	That should be enough. I'll go back to Tator.zts22703e	I have defeated Paimon's monsters.zts22704e	Thanks. Sadly, the evil energy keeps the monsters coming back.zts22705e	Let me give you an Infinity Coin for your deeds.zts22706e	Paimon's Monsterszts22707e	That should be enough. I'll go back to Tator.zts22708e	I have defeated Paimon's monsters.zts22709e	Thanks. Thanks to you, we have a bit of breathing room. But the evil energy will soon see the number of monsters replenished.zts22710e	Don't worry! I'll be here when you need me.zts22711e	Thank you! I trust you.zts22712e	Cleansing the Celestial Spirezts22713e	Thanks. Now we have a moment's peace.zts22714e	Paimon's Shadowzts22715e	I have defeated the phantom of the evil overlord. I'll go and tell Pikidir.zts22716e	I have defeated Paimon's phantom! It was almost as powerful as Paimon himself.zts22717e	Thanks. That's a surprise! I never would have thought that the evil energy could create such a powerful phantom.zts22718e	The phantom will appear again. When it does, I'll let you know.zts22719e	All right. I'll be here for you.zts22720e	Paimon's Tenacityzts22721e	I've dealt with Paimon's phantom.zts22722e	Oh, thank you. Here, take these crystals in reward. You've more than earned them. Could you help me again if the phantom reappears?zts22723e	The Convention (Main Quest Act 7.2)zts22724e	I hear that Belial's orders have been deciphered. Go and talk to the chief. This is a serious matter.zts22725e	Okay, I'll set off immediately.zts22726e	Sorry, I have other matters to attend to just now.zts22727e	To the Infinite Celestial Spire (Side Quest)zts22728e	The Celestial Spire Challenge (Daily Quest)zts22729e	Paimon's Monsters (Side Quest)zts22730e	Cleansing the Celestial Spire (Daily Quest)zts22731e	You've come at just the right time. Can you help me with something in the Celestial Spire?zts22732e	Sure, what do you need me to do?zts22733e	Since Paimon was defeated, no one has entered the Celestial Spire. So we don't know what's going on in there. Could you enter the Celestial Spire and take a look around? We need whatever information you can bring back for us.zts22734e	Ha! Easy peasy. Err... what do you need that information for exactly?zts22735e	We're setting up guidelines to explain what exactly is required to be able to enter the spire. We don't want rookies going in there and winding up mincemeat. If you gather this information for us, I'll make sure you receive a just reward.zts22736e	Okay, I understand. I'll be back shortly.zts22737e	Sorry, I have something else to be doing right now. I'll come back later.zts22738e	Even though Paimon has been defeated, the number of monsters in the spire keeps increasing because of his curse.zts22739e	Maybe they're trying to reopen the rift in the heavens?zts22740e	Could you deal with the monsters for us?zts22741e	Will do!zts22742e	Maybe next time.zts22743e	Even though Paimon has been defeated, the number of monsters in the spire keeps increasing because of his curse.zts22744e	We need to cull their numbers... for safety reasons. Can you deal with that?zts22745e	Sure, no problem.zts22746e	Sorry, maybe another time.zts22747e	It's been reported that the number of monsters is increasing in the spire again. Would you go and sort it out?zts22748e	Of course! I'll drive them out.zts22749e	Paimon's Shadow (Side Quest)zts22750e	Paimon's Tenacity (Daily Quest)zts22751e	I need your help right now.zts22752e	Using a special spell, I've been observing events on the roof of the spire.zts22753e	And... well I hardly know how to say this... I saw Paimon up there, the one you defeated...zts22754e	Upon closer inspection I discovered that it is only a phantom of Paimon.zts22755e	But who knows how dangerous it is and what it intends to do? Could you destroy it?zts22756e	Sure, leave it to me.zts22757e	Hmm, I'll have to prepare myself first.zts22758e	Paimon's phantom has reappeared. I need your help.zts22759e	Okay. Then I'll head for the roof of the spire.zts22760e	Enter the Infinite Celestial Spirezts22761e	Enter Paimon's Raidzts22762e	[Paimon's Raid] You can enter Paimon's Raid from the uppermost level of the spire. Do you want to enter?zts22763e	Enter the Uppermost Level of the Celestial Spirezts22765e	Be careful! There are many unknown evils ahead.zts22766e	- Orders -zts22767e	These are your orders, my loyal servants:zts22768e	My lord and master, the dark overlord of Hellord, will soon arrive. Paimon is coming!zts22769e	But adventurers from NosVille are attempting to foil our plans.zts22770e	Reinforce our troops in the Celestial Spire and make sure our enemies cannot seal the rift to prevent Lord Paimon's arrival from Hellord.zts22771e	When Lord Paimon appears...zts22772e	... you will rule over NosVille once more!zts22773e	- The Demon God Belial -zts22774e	- The Inscription on the Stone Tablet -zts22775e	To those who seek to find the Needle and Thread of the Holy Light:zts22776e	Seek out the lonely tree to the north of the Fields of Gold.zts22777e	If you do not fear the earth, you will find the needle to close the heavens.zts22778e	Seek out the abandoned temple at the furthest bounds of God's will.zts22779e	If you do not fear the saints, you will find the thread to seal the rift.zts22780e	Celestial Spire Shopzts22782e	Celestial Spire Challenge (Main Quest Act 7.2)zts22783e	Are you ready for the Celestial Spire challenge?zts22784e	The Top Level (Paimon Raid)zts22785e	What was that?zts22786e	Arena of Gloryzts22787e	Join the Arena of Glory!zts22788e	13th Anniversary Eventzts22789e	NosTale's celebrating its 13th anniversary and it's all thanks to you! *applause*zts22790e	That's why we have the best present ever for our 13th anniversary!zts22791e	If you bring me the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 13, I'll transform them into your gift.zts22792e	Exchange for 13th Anniversary Medalzts22793e	Exchange for 13th Anniversary Buffzts22794e	The 13th Anniversary Medal has many shop item functions.zts22795e	You need all the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 13. Do you want to exchange them?zts22796e	The 13th Anniversary Buff increases your maximum HP and MP for 3,200 seconds.zts22797e	You need the letters Y, E, A, R plus the number 13. Do you want to receive the buff?zts22798e	The Cursed 13zts22799e	Did you know that 13 is a cursed number?zts22800e	Monsters are trying to make use of that curse by carrying out an awful ritual.zts22801e	I've heard rumours that monsters won't give any more XP if the ritual is completed.zts22802e	There's only one way to stop them.zts22803e	You need to complete all 3 Halloween raids 13x.zts22804e	If you succeed, you'll get the Monstrous title.zts22805e	Of course I'll stop the ritual!zts22806e	Oh, you've saved us again!zts22807e	Thank you, Monstrous <pname>!zts22808e	Fisherman Wadezts22809e	The Merling's Curse (Fishing Specialist Quest)zts22810e	Fishing Tackle Shopzts22811e	Daily Fishing Questzts22812e	Please help me, adventurer. My brother's in great danger... and it's my fault.zts22813e	I can teach you how to fish.zts22814e	Fishing Instructionszts22815e	What do I need to go fishing?zts22816e	Where can I fish?zts22817e	How do I get fishing experience?zts22818e	First, you must switch to Fishing Specialist.zts22819e	Then you can fish from the shore.zts22820e	Use the 'Cast Line' skill and then wait until something bites.zts22821e	Then, at the right moment, you'll need to use 'Reel In'.zts22822e	Depending on the probability rating, the result will be 'Success', 'Fail' or 'Fishing line broke'.zts22823e	'Success' means you've caught a fish. 'Fail' means the fish got away. If the result is 'Fishing line broke', you'll lose your fishing line and come away empty-handed.zts22824e	I have another question!zts22825e	You'll need bait as well as a fishing line in order to go fishing.zts22826e	Make sure you've got at least one of each in your inventory.zts22827e	When you use 'Cast Line' or 'Cast Line (Pro)', one piece of bait will be used up.zts22828e	If the fishing line breaks, it will be removed from your inventory.zts22829e	I sell both items. If you feel like fishing, I'll do you a good deal.zts22830e	You can look up fishing spots in the Encyclopaedia of Fish.zts22831e	Fishing spot levels and fish you've caught are recorded in there.zts22832e	The displayed level relates to the Fishing Specialist, not to your combat level.zts22833e	Anglers can only receive experience points by fishing.zts22834e	The experience points you receive depend on the value of your catch.zts22835e	A Fishing Specialist can reach a maximum level of 50.zts22836e	A Great Day for Fishing, Isn't It?zts22837e	A Fishing Jolly in NosVillezts22838e	A Fishing Jolly in Port Alveus Squarezts22839e	A Fishing Jolly in Maple Woodszts22840e	A Fishing Jolly in the Desert Izts22841e	A Fishing Jolly in the Desert IIzts22842e	A Fishing Jolly in the Oasiszts22843e	A Fishing Jolly in the Tropical Seazts22844e	A Fishing Jolly at the Tropical Riverzts22845e	A Fishing Jolly in the Polluted Forestzts22846e	A Fishing Jolly at the Spirit Riverzts22847e	A Fishing Jolly in the Lava Regionzts22848e	A great day for fishing, isn't it, adventurer?zts22849e	What can be better than starting the day with a bit of fishing?zts22850e	It's fun and relaxing. And if you're lucky, you might even catch something!zts22851e	I'm in! (Accept)zts22852e	The fishing spot in NosVille is suitable for beginners at levels 1-4.zts22853e	The fish there literally throw themselves at the bait!zts22854e	In NosVille, you'll learn all the basics a real angler needs.zts22855e	Wonderful! Then I'll try my luck at this fishing spot. (Accept)zts22856e	The fishing spot in Port Alveus Square is suitable for anglers at levels 5-9.zts22857e	You can catch your first marine fish there.zts22858e	There are tons of these slippery delicacies to be had there.zts22859e	In Port Alveus Square, you can build on your basic angling skills.zts22860e	The fishing spot in Maple Woods is suitable for anglers at levels 10-14.zts22861e	There are freshwater fish there that you've never seen before!zts22862e	Maybe you'll pick up a new fishing skill or two there as well.zts22863e	The fishing spot in Mortaz Desert Harbour is suitable for anglers at levels 15-19.zts22864e	There are all sorts of fish at the fishing spot near the desert.zts22865e	Maybe you'll pick up a new fishing skill or two there as well.zts22866e	The fishing spot in Tart Hapendam is suitable for anglers at levels 20-24.zts22867e	This fishing spot is also near a desert, but the fish you can catch there are different to the ones in Mortaz Desert Harbour.zts22868e	Maybe you'll pick up a new fishing skill or two in Tart Hapendam as well.zts22869e	The fishing spot in the Oasis is suitable for anglers at levels 25-29.zts22870e	This fishing spot is located in the middle of the desert, at an oasis.zts22871e	It might be hard to believe, but it's teeming with fish there.zts22872e	You'll be absolutely amazed!zts22873e	The fishing spot in Port Moritius is suitable for anglers at levels 30-34.zts22874e	You've become a competent angler.zts22875e	Now you can try your hand at catching the strong, large fish in the tropical zone.zts22876e	That's where you'll catch the most magnificent specimens!zts22877e	The fishing spot on the Woodland Path is suitable for anglers at levels 35-39.zts22878e	The Tropical River is alive with aggressive, hardy fish that will do whatever it takes to defend their territory.zts22879e	You can be really proud of yourself if you catch one like that!zts22880e	The fishing spot in the Polluted Forest is suitable for anglers at levels 40-44.zts22881e	As you well know, the river has been polluted by evil forces.zts22882e	That's why the fish there have mutated. I doubt you'll ever have seen anything like it.zts22883e	You can eat them, but only in moderation.zts22884e	The fishing spot in Spirit Forest is suitable for anglers at levels 45-49.zts22885e	The forest is guarded by spirits.zts22886e	They protect all living beings in the forest, which makes it harder to catch fish there.zts22887e	Oh, what am I talking about. You've become so experienced that you'll rise to this challenge, too.zts22888e	The fishing spot at Phoenix Wings is only suitable for anglers who have learnt all the skills.zts22889e	Did you know that lots of creatures live in the molten lava?zts22890e	I didn't believe it at first, either.zts22891e	But it's true. And among them are lots of fish.zts22892e	This will be your most difficult fishing challenge so far.zts22894e	What's wrong? You look so serious.zts22895e	Hm? Oh, I was just thinking about my brother.zts22896e	We loved fishing even when we were kids. We travelled the world on the hunt for new fishing spots.zts22897e	One day, we heard that the sea route leading to Moritius Island had been created.zts22898e	So we made our way to Moritius in the hope that we'd find some rich fishing grounds.zts22899e	Eventually, we discovered a murky swamp that no one had entered up until then.zts22900e	We came across a superb fishing spot and set up camp straight away.zts22901e	... And I'll regret it to the day I die.zts22902e	What happened there?zts22903e	A strange fog came down around us all of a sudden, and we passed out.zts22904e	We eventually came to inside a cave.zts22905e	My brother was in a lot of pain and turned into a merling!zts22906e	And then a huge merling suddenly appeared.zts22907e	Did he cast a spell on you?zts22908e	Yes, that's exactly what happened. He said he was the powerful merling sorcerer Arku. He seemed incredibly angry.zts22909e	He bellowed that it was his kingdom.zts22910e	And that if I wanted to save my brother, I would have to complete a task for him.zts22911e	Arku ordered me to catch the most delicious fish in the world and gave me a month to do it.zts22912e	If I can't do it, my brother will suffer the curse for all eternity.zts22913e	I've been catching fish all over the world, each one more succulent than the last.zts22914e	But Arku's turned his nose up at all of them so far.zts22915e	My time is up tomorrow and... I don't know what to do anymore. Please help me!zts22916e	I don't know the first thing about fishing, but I have a friend who certainly does. Don't worry, I'll help you and your brother.zts22917e	Thank you so much, adventurer!zts22918e	(My best bet is to ask Propga in Mortaz Desert Harbour if he can help me.)zts22920e	Hello, Propga.zts22921e	Oh, hello there, adventurer! What brings you here?zts22922e	Do you know which is the most delicious fish in the world?zts22923e	Hm, the most delicious fish in the world...zts22924e	A difficult question that I can't answer in general terms, unfortunately. After all, each one has its own flavour.zts22925e	Personally, I love tuna.zts22926e	So who's this fish for?zts22927e	It's for a merling sorcerer. He's tasked someone with bringing him the most delicious fish in the world.zts22928e	Hm, a fish for a merling?zts22929e	Exactly. So do you know what type of fish merlings like?zts22930e	Indeed I do. Most merlings like fish that smell really rank. The more rancid, the better.zts22931e	Ugh! How disgusting.zts22932e	Hehe, yes. I can't understand why, either.zts22933e	Thanks for the information. I've got to get going.zts22934e	You're welcome. Good luck with your search!zts22935e	(Right, back to Wade!)zts22937e	Hello, adventurer! Do you have good news for me?zts22938e	Yes, I do... but also bad news.zts22939e	Oh... Then please start with the good news.zts22940e	I've found out that merlings like rotten fish.zts22941e	Ah, so that's why he didn't like the fresh fish I brought him. And what's the bad news?zts22942e	It'll be hard for us to come by rotten fish in such a short space of time.zts22943e	So then my brother's lost...zts22944e	We'll find a way, I promise! We've just got to make sure the fish gives off a good pong. Maybe we'll be able to trick the merling using other food that's gone off.zts22945e	Hm, good idea! But still, how are we going to get hold of rotten food?zts22946e	Let me worry about that. In the meantime, you just concentrate on getting a fish that we can stuff full of food.zts22947e	Okay, I'm on it.zts22948e	(Hm, Eva Energy is bound to have some food that fits the bill. I'll pay her a visit.)zts22950e	Hellooo, Eva. Have you got any groceries on offer that have gone off?zts22951e	What? Groceries that have gone off? I beg your pardon! I only sell fresh food!zts22952e	What do you need it for, then?zts22953e	I need a rotting fish so I can save someone who's been captured by a merling.zts22954e	The plan was to trick him using a fish filled with food that's gone off.zts22955e	Ah, now I understand. Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that at the moment. But I think Mimi Mentor's having some problems with unpleasant smells. Ask her if she can help you.zts22956e	Thank you!zts22957e	Do come back when you're in the mood for something tasty.zts22959e	Hello! Eva told me you've got a little 'odour problem'.zts22960e	So word's got around already. Yes, there's a terrible smell in the NosVille Meadows.zts22961e	I fear that the stench will spread into NosVille, too.zts22962e	I'll go and have a look what's causing the stench.zts22963e	Thanks. If you go from here towards the NosVille Meadows, you'll come to a narrow path that goes off left through the trees. The source of the smell must be somewhere on that path.zts22964e	All right. I'll take care of it.zts22966e	(The stench was originating from rancid cheese and rotten eggs that evil imps had hidden there.)zts22967e	(I'm sure I'll be able to rescue Wade's brother with this stinking lot.)zts22969e	I've destroyed the source of the stench. You should now be able to breathe freely there again.zts22970e	Thanks. Urk... I've still got that stench in my nose.zts22971e	I took some of the cheese and eggs with me. I'll need them to rescue someone.zts22972e	All right. I hope you know what you're doing. That stuff smells awful. *retch*zts22973e	Thanks for your help once again!zts22974e	Oh, it was nothing. Farewell! (Well, I shouldn't keep Wade waiting any longer.)zts22976e	Phwooooar, you were obviously successful. You stink to high heaven!zts22977e	Yes. I've got some rotten eggs and rancid cheese here. Did you get the fish?zts22978e	Here, take it. A tasty piranha.zts22979e	Then I'll stuff the rotten food into it now. Right, done.zts22980e	Perfect! *retch* How can such a small fish smell so rank? We're sure to outsmart that merling with this.zts22981e	Now, where can I find this merling? And how do I get there?zts22982e	Arku gave me this magic statue that will teleport me to him.zts22983e	Take it. It will take you straight to Arku's Cave.zts22984e	Okay. I can manage that.zts22985e	You should keep an eye out for Arku's undead henchmen!zts22987e	(So I can use this statue to get to Arku. Then let's...)zts22989e	Hm? You're not Wade. Who are you?zts22990e	I'm his messenger.zts22991e	*sniff* What's that gloriously rotten smell?zts22992e	This delicious fish here.zts22993e	Oh, a delicacy! Give it here!zts22994e	It's making your mouth water, hm? Sure, you can have it.zts22995e	Oh, that's kind of you. Now give it here already! Come on!zts22996e	Only on one condition.zts22997e	Let me guess... You want me to let that pathetic human I turned into a merling go. Is that right?zts22998e	That's right. Let him go, then you get the fish.zts22999e	Give me the fish first and then you can have him.zts23000e	How can I trust you? You're only getting the fish once you've let him go.zts23001e	If not... then I'll just eat the fish myself.zts23002e	W... Wait, not so fast! All right, you win. But heaven help you if I don't get my fish!zts23003e	(Arku casts a strange spell.)zts23004e	Oh, I... I'm me again! Where's my big brother?zts23005e	I'm a friend of Wade's. He asked me to rescue you. Don't worry, he's fine.zts23006e	Now you've got to keep your end of the bargain. Give. Me. The. FISH!!!zts23007e	Very well. Here, Arku. Enjoy. Tuck in!zts23008e	*nomnom* Thanks.zts23009e	Ugh! It tastes disgusting! Please, who goes sticking mouldy cheese into fish!?zts23010e	You tricked me. Now you're on the menu!zts23011e	Be careful!zts23012e	Challenge accepted! Show me what you've got!zts23014e	Argh, I surrender! Please forgive me!zts23015e	Why did you do that to the twins?zts23016e	I just hate people fishing in my swamp.zts23017e	But that's not a reason to threaten them, or go as far as abducting them! No, I won't accept your excuse.zts23018e	I swear on the holy Merling Loa that I'll never attack anyone again! Please forgive me!zts23019e	Bah, am I meant to believe you?zts23020e	As a token of my sincerity, I will give you my most valuable possession.zts23021e	Here, with this equipment you'll become a true professional angler. Now go, please.zts23022e	Then we'll let mercy come before justice on this one. But if you ever attack anyone again, I'll finish you!zts23023e	Understood. I swear.zts23024e	(Hm, a specialist card. Maybe Wade will know what to do with it.)zts23026e	(It's best if I take Wade's brother back to him.)zts23028e	Wade, I'm back!zts23029e	My dear brother! You're okay. Oh, thank you so much, adventurer!zts23030e	I'm pleased for you.zts23031e	What did you do with Arku?zts23032e	He swore to me that he'll never attack anyone again.zts23033e	He's so intimidated that he won't be going anywhere near a human again.zts23034e	That sounds good. It's put my mind at ease.zts23035e	Oh, by the way, Arku gave me this card. According to Arku, this magic thing will make me into a professional angler. I wanted to give it to you because fishing's not really my thing.zts23036e	Wow! Amazing - this card is regarded as legendary treasure in the fishing community. Thank you, but I can't accept it.zts23037e	Keep it for yourself and give it a try.zts23038e	But I don't have a clue about fishing.zts23039e	With this card, your body will automatically make all the right movements. And I'll help you out as well.zts23040e	But you want to travel the world and discover new fishing grounds.zts23041e	Ah, when I was on the hunt for the perfect fish for Arku, I saw all of the world's fishing spots.zts23042e	Now I've set myself a new goal.zts23043e	And that would be?zts23044e	As a self-proclaimed fishing ambassador, I'll go out into the world and spread the word about the finest hobby of all. I'll teach people and open their hearts to the joy of fishing.zts23045e	That sounds great! Then I'll be your first student.zts23046e	I hope that humans will enjoy fishing as much as I do.zts23047e	Tight lines, adventurer!zts23048e	Fishing Side Questzts23049e	Hey, adventurer! Do you know what makes a fisherman really happy?zts23050e	No idea.

That is quite clearly the biggest fish of its kind.zts23070e	So you know all about freshwater fish, then.zts23071e	Let's see if that's also case with marine fish.zts23072e	Have a go at catching the biggest Red Starfish.zts23073e	Wade, I've caught the biggest Red Starfish!zts23074e	Congratulations!zts23075e	Let's turn up the heat a bit now. Catch the biggest Bespectacled Carp for me.zts23076e	Wade, look! I've caught the biggest Bespectacled Carp.zts23077e	Great! So are you ready for the next challenge?zts23078e	This time, I'd like you to catch the biggest Deep-Sea Pollock.zts23079e	You can fish for the Deep-Sea Pollock at the fishing spot in Mortaz Desert Harbour.zts23080e	Here's the biggest Deep-Sea Pollock, Wade.zts23081e	Oh, wonderful. Next up, hook yourself the biggest Squid.zts23082e	You can fish for that one in Tart Hapendam.zts23083e	Come on, show me what you've got!zts23084e	Here, Wade. The biggest Squid in the world.zts23085e	Excellent! Now you've got to catch the biggest Snakehead.zts23086e	For that, head to Akamur Camp or the Oasis.zts23087e	But be careful! The bad-tempered ol' Snakey-head is not to be trifled with.zts23088e	So, I've got the biggest Snakehead here.zts23089e	Hm, it'd be fantastic if you caught the biggest Tuna.zts23090e	Be prepared because Tuna are very strong fish, which means they're not easy to catch.zts23091e	I've caught the biggest Tuna, Wade.zts23092e	Next, you've got to catch the biggest Red Sunfish.zts23093e	The Red Sunfish is very small and inconspicuous. So keep your eyes peeled!zts23094e	If I remember rightly, you'll find Red Sunfish by the Woodland Path on Moritius Island.zts23095e	Go, bring me the biggest Red Sunfish!zts23096e	Look, I've caught the biggest Red Sunfish!zts23097e	I'd like another Snakehead next.zts23098e	But not just any old Snakehead - the most dangerous one in the world!zts23099e	I'm talking about the Red Snakehead.zts23100e	You'll find the Red Snakehead near the Polluted Forest on Moritius Island.zts23101e	So, here you are. The biggest Red Snakehead in the world.zts23102e	It's time for your last challenge.zts23103e	And this one is really something. Bring me the biggest Lava Shark!zts23104e	You'll find it in Valakus' Claws, the Phoenix Wings or on Katol's Street.zts23105e	You'll also need an item such as Ice Flower Oil in order to enter the Lava Regions, for sure.zts23106e	Wade, I did it! Here's the biggest Lava Shark.zts23107e	Many congratulations, you've mastered all of the challenges!zts23108e	Here is your well-earned reward.zts23109e	What did you think of the challenges?zts23110e	To be honest... At the beginning, it was all about the reward for me. But then I realised how much fun fishing is.zts23111e	That's great. It's true that, with fishing, having a goal makes you much more motivated.zts23112e	(He's right! Now I'll have to find myself a new goal. Hm, where should I go fishing next?)zts23113e	I wonder what sort of reward I'll get.zts23114e	Level 20 - Bigfootzts23115e	Hey, adventurer! Have you ever heard of Bigfoot?zts23116e	Who or what is a 'Bigfoot'?zts23117e	Bigfoot is a legendary creature which appears in many myths.zts23118e	Oh, a legendary creature.zts23119e	That's right. Even though there are many rumours about this creature, no one has ever seen it.zts23120e	Not much has been said about it recently.zts23121e	However, a few people have reported seeing an ape-like being in the snow and a talking tiger who can walk upright.zts23122e	That's sure to be related to Bigfoot.zts23123e	Interesting. Do you know where I can find this creature?zts23124e	It you go searching around the snowy level and can find out where this tiger is, you might be able to learn more about Bigfoot.zts23125e	Oh, wonderful. I'll do that.zts23126e	See you later!zts23128e	Well then, let's set out in search of Bigfoot.zts23130e	And? Did you find out anything?zts23131e	Sorry, no.zts23132e	Too bad.zts23133e	But thanks for looking into it.zts23134e	Do you believe in Bigfoot?zts23135e	Of course! I know it's real. I'll find it one day.zts23136e	Our world is vast and full of strange creatures. Yes, I can imagine that.zts23137e	Easter Questzts23138e	Colourful Eggs and Word Gameszts23139e	<pname>!

Then you need to be right level. Finally, of course, you need the ingredients!zts23187e	Once you've got all of those things, you can try to prepare a meal.zts23188e	The ingredients need to be chopped up ready before you start cooking.zts23189e	Use the Chop Ingredients skill to do that.zts23190e	There are three basic types of meal: Roasts, Stir Fries and Stews.zts23191e	Select the type of meal you want to prepare and then the specific dish you want to cook.zts23192e	When you start, you'll see and hear the sounds of cooking.zts23193e	Once dark steam starts to rise, it's time to stop cooking.zts23195e	There are three possible results to your cooking: success, major success and failure.zts23196e	Depending on the result, you'll either get the meal you wanted... or something else!zts23197e	What results can there be when cooking?zts23198e	I have some more questions.zts23202e	How long do Full Belly Buffs last?zts23203e	I make special spice mixes myself.zts23204e	These are Garlic Powder, Chilli Powder, Cinnamon, Pepper and MSG. I make them according to my own special recipes from back home.zts23205e	I can sell most of them to you any time you want. You can get MSG from the raid bosses on Moritius.zts23206e	Do you want to know where you can harvest vegetable ingredients?zts23207e	Big Lettuces, Tomatoes, Onions and Mangos grow on certain fields.zts23208e	Just go and pick them yourself.zts23209e	You'll find them all over the world.zts23210e	Well, how do you like cooking with my special powers?zts23211e	You should practise your skills every day to keep getting better.zts23212e	Why don't you prepare any two meals of your liking for me?zts23213e	Of course I'll give you something in return for your efforts.zts23214e	Alright, I'll do my best.zts23215e	Maybe later.zts23216e	Anything else you want me to do?zts23217e	Ooh, it smells burnt! Roasts clearly aren't your speciality.zts23218e	You need to practise more before you'll be able to help me.zts23219e	It's important that you get the temperature right.zts23220e	It looks easier than it is.zts23221e	Keep practising your roasts.zts23222e	Cook a simple roast for me.zts23223e	You know, stews seem to be going out of fashion these days.zts23224e	They're not always easy, as they need a lot of time and different ingredients.zts23225e	But just dip your spoon into a warm stew and you instantly realise it was worth the effort.zts23226e	Right, let's practise making stews today.zts23227e	Bring me the following stews.zts23228e	Guess what my favourite dishes are? That's right, stir fries!zts23229e	Stir fries are absolutely magical. Just the sound of freshly chopped spices sizzling in the wok is enough to make my mouth water!zts23230e	Any chef worth their salt should have at least one good stir fry recipe up their sleeve.zts23231e	Make sure you practise hard.zts23232e	I should probably report back to my kingdom about some of my results.zts23233e	I'm currently working on some simple roast recipes that anyone could cook.zts23234e	Could you recommend any to me?zts23235e	Bring me two roast meals that would be easy for a beginner like you.zts23236e	Of course there'll be a little something in it for you too.zts23237e	I'm currently working on some simple stew recipes that anyone could cook.zts23238e	I'm currently working on some simple stir fry recipes that anyone could cook.zts23239e	The people from my kingdom are already looking forward to our next meals.zts23240e	They want even more tasty roasts.zts23241e	It'd be great if you could rustle up some more difficult roasts.zts23242e	Ready, steady, cook!zts23243e	They want even more tasty stews.zts23244e	They want even more tasty stir fries.zts23245e	Royal Meals on Wheels 1zts23246e	Royal Meals on Wheels 2zts23247e	Royal Meals on Wheels 3zts23248e	Royal Meals on Wheels 4zts23249e	Royal Meals on Wheels 5zts23250e	Royal Meals on Wheels 6zts23251e	Royal Meals on Wheels 7zts23252e	The Last Mealzts23253e	If you're very fortunate, your meal will be blessed.zts23254e	You'll also receive an additional Fortune Cake.zts23255e	Eat the Fortune Cake and you might get some handy items.zts23256e	If you're very fortunate at a higher cooking level, you could get an even better Fortune Cake.zts23257e	When you manage to cook properly, you'll receive the meal you were making.zts23258e	However, if you fail, you'll get a Dodgy Dish.zts23259e	This is still edible, but it might not be too healthy.zts23263e	Your fullness points show how long your Full Belly Buff will last.zts23264e	The number depends on the meal you eat.zts23265e	Your activities will also reduce that number.zts23266e	Using skills or receiving damage costs you points.zts23270e	When it comes to combat, Chefs aren't like other specialists.zts23271e	Specialists like Anglers and Chefs can trade with others.zts23272e	In other words, they're both Lifestyle specialisations which you can choose as a side job.zts23273e	And if you want to become a Lifestyle specialist, you'll need to choose a side job of your own.zts23274e	To do that, simply go and talk to the person who's a master in that area.zts23275e	It doesn't cost you anything to choose a side job.zts23276e	Even if you decide to change your side job, your previous Lifestyle specialist card will be saved.zts23277e	Select Chef Side Jobzts23278e	Amateur Rotisserie Chefzts23279e	Professional Rotisserie Chefzts23280e	Rotisserie Masterchefzts23281e	Amateur Stew Chefzts23282e	Professional Stew Chefzts23283e	Stew Masterchefzts23284e	Amateur Stir Fry Chefzts23285e	Professional Stir Fry Chefzts23286e	Stir Fry Masterchefzts23287e	With this card, your body will automatically make all the right movements.

Otherwise it costs 1,000,000 Gold. Consider wisely before making your decision, and then tell me if you want to become an Angler.zts23290e	Let me introduce myself.zts23291e	No, don't bother, just tell me about these mysterious powers.zts23292e	My name's Terry, and I'm from the Kingdom of Savero, the nation of food under the ground.zts23293e	(Fine, let's see what he has to say.)zts23294e	The people in the kingdom only have one goal in life: to try out as many new meals and learn as many new recipes as possible.zts23295e	For a long time, we had plenty of ingredients in our underground world, enough for us to cook lots of delicious meals and experiment with new recipes.zts23296e	But these days it's a lot harder finding new things.zts23297e	I'm here on a quest to seek out new ingredients and discover new recipes.zts23298e	I've never heard of this place.zts23299e	That doesn't surprise me. It's been thousands of years since we last appeared above ground.zts23300e	I see. Well, what can I do for you?zts23301e	I'm told this land above ground is full of terrifying and dangerous monsters.zts23302e	So I'd be much obliged if you could help me to learn some new recipes.zts23303e	And in return, I'll teach you the secrets of these mysterious powers.zts23304e	Really? Oooh, I so want them! What do you need me to do?zts23305e	First and foremost, I need some fresh vegetables.zts23306e	Show me a new vegetable.zts23307e	Alright, I'll see what I can do. (I think there are some vegetables in NosVille. Best hop to it!)zts23309e	I was right. Now I just need to harvest enough Big Lettuces.zts23311e	Here you go. This is a fresh vegetable which grows above ground. Do you like it?zts23312e	Wow, that's so much bigger than anything we have! What is it called?zts23313e	They call it 'Lettuce'.zts23314e	Excellent! I'll use this lettuce as a vegetable base. The next thing I need is some meat.zts23315e	There are lots of different types of meat. What sort do you want?zts23316e	I think something fatty would go well with this lettuce. What would you suggest?zts23317e	Hmm... why don't I bring you a few different meats to try? That way you can taste them all and see which is best.zts23318e	An excellent idea! Okay, you fetch me a few different types of meat from your world.zts23320e	So this is what meat above ground looks like... Thanks, I'll give it a taste.zts23321e	(I wonder what he'll say to that?)zts23322e	Hmm. It's salty, but otherwise this fish doesn't taste of much.zts23323e	The dried meat is a bit tough on the teeth. And while the chicken is nice and spicy, it's not really my thing.zts23324e	Hmm... this pork is pretty good though. Let me cook that with the fresh lettuce.zts23325e	So it's pork you want?zts23326e	Yes, it's perfect. Bring me some more and I'll cook up the most delicious pork dish you've ever tasted.zts23327e	Okay. (I'll ask Eva Energy where to get pork from.)zts23329e	Hello, adventurer, what brings you here?zts23330e	Hey, can I buy some pork from you?zts23331e	Oh no, sorry, I'm all sold out of pork today.zts23332e	Darn. Do you know where I could get some?zts23333e	My supplier told me something.zts23334e	He said he sources his pork from the pigs in Krem.zts23335e	Thanks for the tip! (Guess I should catch a few pigs in Krem.)zts23337e	Here's the pork you wanted.zts23338e	Thank you! That looks very fresh.zts23339e	Right, let me whip up my first meal with pork and lettuce.zts23340e	Everything's ready to cook. A good chef, fresh ingredients and... just a moment! Oh no, where are they?!zts23341e	What do you need?zts23342e	Oh my word! I've got a big problem here.zts23343e	My special spices have vanished!zts23344e	What do you mean? Can't you make the spices yourself?zts23345e	Yes, but I can't make any more. They're made from special ingredients from my country back underground.zts23346e	You know, while I was passing through Maple Woods, I had to run away from some monsters who were nipping at my heels.zts23347e	I bet I dropped the spices there. Could you go back to the woods and find them for me?zts23348e	I suppose I don't have much choice, do I? Alright, I'll try to find them for you.zts23349e	Oh, thank you! I had three spices altogether.zts23351e	I found three bottles of spices. Are these the ones?zts23352e	Yes! Spices #1, #2 and #3, all present and account for! Great job, thank you so much.zts23353e	So are you going to cook now?zts23354e	You bet! Let me show you my skills.zts23355e	Mmm... that smells delicious!zts23357e	Right, done. My first meal above ground: Roast Pork a l Terry!zts23358e	Wow, that's delicious! I think this is the best thing I've ever tasted!zts23359e	Haha! But it doesn't only taste good. This food also gives you power.zts23360e	Seriously? So what are these mysterious powers you keep talking of?zts23361e	When you eat it, you'll unlock incredible powers.zts23362e	Yes, but what powers?zts23363e	The food will still your hunger and give you a feeling of being full. And those fullness points will grant you a Full Belly Buff.zts23364e	Here, eat up and feel the energy.zts23365e	But I've never felt any special power from eating food before.zts23366e	No, that's because only meals prepared by the chefs of our kingdom have this power.zts23367e	I can't explain to you exactly how, that's a secret which belongs to our kingdom's chefs.zts23368e	I can only say that it's passed from master to apprentice.zts23369e	I see. So you're saying that the only way to get that power is by eating food you prepare?zts23370e	No, you can make the meals yourself!zts23371e	I told you I would share with you my powers. This here makes you a cook of the Kingdom of Savero. Congratulations, you're now a chef!zts23372e	Wow, amazing! Can I cook something now?zts23373e	Not yet. First you need to select Chef as your side job. If you already have another side job, this change will cost you a lot of gold.zts23374e	If you decide to become a Chef, you can only select other Lifestyle specialisations such as Angler once you change your side job again.zts23375e	Congratulations, you're now a Chef!zts23376e	Wow! It's an unexpected honour, but I bet it'll be great fun!zts23378e	Good news!zts23379e	Our dish is very popular with the kingdom's royal masterchef.zts23380e	He's decided to present the dish to the king and his guests!zts23381e	I'll have to cook up some big portions, and will need your help to prepare it all.zts23382e	Can you help?zts23384e	Well done! Now we can deliver these meals to the royal palace.zts23385e	If they're satisfied with our food, they're sure to order more later.zts23386e	When that happens, I'll ask you for help again.zts23388e	The king was very pleased with our meals and I've already received another order.zts23389e	We need to deliver some more meals, and I'll need your help.zts23390e	I'll be sure to tell my king about everything you've done.zts23391e	Can you give me a hand?zts23393e	Excellent! Now we can deliver these meals to the royal palace.zts23394e	If they're satisfied with our food, they're sure to order more later.zts23395e	When that happens, I'll ask you for help again.zts23397e	The royal palace has ordered some gourmet meals from us.zts23398e	But I'm sure you'll manage it. After all, you're a Royal Apprentice Chef yourself!zts23399e	Think you could help me again?zts23401e	That sure looks tasty!zts23402e	I knew you'd manage it!zts23403e	I'll ask you for new recipes later when I receive fresh orders.zts23405e	The royal palace has ordered some more gourmet meals from us.zts23406e	They've asked for something with noodles. I bet you have a special recipe for them?zts23407e	I have faith in your abilities. Just bring me the food when it's ready.zts23409e	Wow, that tastes even better than I expected!zts23410e	Right, I think it's about time you earned a promotion.zts23411e	I'll send to the kingdom and put your name forward for a promotion.zts23413e	We've mastered everything - roasts, stews, stir fries.zts23414e	We'll manage.zts23415e	Please put your soul into it. If this delivery is successful, you'll be promoted to a Royal Chef.zts23416e	Don't panic! You'll manage.zts23418e	Everything is perfect!zts23419e	You're now officially a Royal Chef of my kingdom!zts23421e	And you've received your first order as Royal Chef.zts23422e	For this meal you'll need some extremely rare ingredients.zts23423e	Looks like a very difficult order.zts23424e	But I have confidence in your abilities: after all, you're the first Royal Chef from above ground!zts23426e	Absolutely scrumptious! You're a very talented cook.zts23427e	I think you can reckon with more orders soon.zts23428e	Keep practising your skills for the next meal.zts23430e	Your last dish was very popular with the royal family.zts23431e	Now everyone at court is dying to taste your next creation.zts23432e	We've received a new order for gourmet meals.zts23433e	It'll be hard work, but I'm sure you'll make it look like child's play.zts23435e	Excellent! A virtuoso performance in the kitchen, no question about it.zts23436e	It seems to me that you've really mastered everything there is to know as a masterchef.zts23437e	I'm going to suggest that you be granted the title as the Royal Chef of Honour.zts23438e	Finally! That's the last order, and with it you'll earn the title of Royal Chef of Honour.zts23439e	Make sure you put together the most opulent and delicious meals your cooking skills can manage!zts23440e	If this delivery is a success, you'll become a Royal Chef of Honour and be richly rewarded.zts23441e	Cook like you've never cooked before!zts23443e	You did it! My king has granted you the title, Royal Chef of Honour!zts23444e	If you ever visit my kingdom some day, you'll be allowed to cook for the royal family whenever you like.zts23445e	Thank you so much. I'll let you know as soon as any more orders come through.zts23447e	(That's all of Terry's spices. Best bring them back to him.)zts23448e	If you can put together a Mixed Bunfish Skewer for me, I'll grant you the title Amateur Rotisserie Chef.zts23450e	Wow, you couldn't get a tastier Mixed Bunfish Skewer. You've certainly earned the title Amateur Rotisserie Chef.zts23451e	If you prepare a Sockeye Salmon Fillet for me, I'll grant you the title Professional Rotisserie Chef.zts23453e	That's one superb Sockeye Salmon Fillet! You've certainly earned the title Professional Rotisserie Chef.zts23454e	If you whip up a BBQ River Tyrant for me, I'll grant you the title Rotisserie Masterchef.zts23456e	Delicious and crispy, that's the epitome of a BBQ River Tyrant. You've certainly earned the title Rotisserie Masterchef.zts23458e	If you put together an Owlbear and Moss Stew for me, I'll grant you the title Amateur Stew Chef.zts23460e	Wow, the flavours in this Owlbear and Moss Stew really come through. You've certainly earned the title Amateur Stew Chef.zts23461e	If you cook up some Terrapin Noodles for me, I'll grant you the title Professional Stew Chef.zts23463e	That's the perfect ratio of meat to noodles in these Terrapin Noodles. You've certainly earned the title Professional Stew Chef.zts23464e	If you brew up a Drunken Octopus Stew for me, I'll grant you the title Stew Masterchef.zts23466e	That's one thick and juicy Drunken Octopus Stew. You've certainly earned the title Stew Masterchef.zts23468e	If you stir up a spicy fried red sunfish for me, I'll grant you the title Amateur Stir Fry Chef.zts23470e	That's one nicely cooked Spicy Fried Red Sunfish! You've certainly earned the title Amateur Stir Fry Chef.zts23471e	If you splash together some Chilled Fried Noodles for me, I'll grant you the title Professional Stir Fry Chef.zts23473e	Those are some exceedingly well done Chilled Fried Noodles. You've certainly earned the title Professional Stir Fry Chef.zts23474e	If you whip up a Fried Lava Fish for me, I'll grant you the title Stir Fry Masterchef.zts23476e	Your stir-frying techniques really come into their own in this Fried Lava Fish. You've certainly earned the title Stir Fry Masterchef.zts23477e	If you use the Finish Cooking skill at just the right moment, you'll make a success of your cooking attempt.zts23478e	Eating meals prepared by a chef from the Kingdom of Savero will grant you Full Belly Buffs.zts23479e	Full Belly Buffs come in three levels: I, II and III.zts23480e	The first meal you eat will grant you Full Belly Buff I.zts23481e	You can reach Full Belly Buffs II and III by collecting fullness points.zts23482e	The maximum number of points is 5,000.zts23483e	Each meal has a level. You can eat low-level meals at Full Belly Buff I, medium-level meals at Full Belly Buff I and II, and high-level meals at any buff level.zts23484e	Make sure to pick the right meal for your satiety level.zts23485e	Backzts23486e	Bring me two stews that would be easy for a beginner like you.zts23487e	Bring me two stir fries that would be easy for a beginner like you.zts23488e	If you eat a Dodgy Dish, your fullness points could go up or down.zts23489e	It's up you whether you eat it or not. But if you don't want to take the risk, make sure you get good at cooking.zts23490e	Don't do anything unnecessary while the Full Belly Buff is active.zts23491e	Cooking for Expertszts23492e	You need to prepare your ingredients before starting cooking.zts23493e	Prepare a roast meal for me.zts23494e	Whip up a stew for me.zts23495e	Cook me up a stir fry.zts23509e	Searching for Ancient Heroeszts23510e	<pname>, could you come for a moment?zts23511e	I also wanted to thank you for helping us out with fighting Paimon. That demon has been after us for ages.zts23512e	Wow! I didn't realise he'd been making your lives a misery for so long.zts23513e	We only recently found out that the ancient demon is actually Paimon who once plagued us hundreds of years ago.zts23514e	I see.zts23515e	Back then, our forefathers managed to seal him away for hundreds of years. Those ancestors will be known as 'Ancient Heroes' for all time.zts23516e	But it looks as though Paimon is growing stronger. He's on the brink of making a return.zts23517e	Seriously? How did they even manage to seal him?zts23518e	No one knows exactly. There aren't any records of any sort.zts23519e	Pikidir might be able to tell you more about them. He seems to be very interested in this matter for some reason.zts23520e	That's fine, I'll talk to him.zts23522e	Hello <pname>. What can this humble old alchemist do for you today?zts23523e	Can you tell me anything about the Ancient Heroes?zts23524e	Ancient Heroes? Hm... I know lots of stories about their exploits. There are virtually no records concerning these fighters on the island, though.zts23525e	How can I find out more about them?zts23526e	As I said, there are few records on them... on this island, at least. They moved around a lot back then, though.zts23527e	You could also ask around in the village if anyone knows anything interesting.zts23528e	Thanks, I will.zts23530e	Oh! Hello <pname>. Long time no see! How's life as an adventurer treating you?zts23531e	Hi, Mimi. I can't complain. Say, have you ever heard of the Ancient Orc Heroes? Do you know anything about them?zts23532e	Hm, the Ancient Orc Heroes... Hm... No, I'm afraid I've never heard of them.zts23533e	Too bad...zts23534e	But they might have had something to do with those ancient, mysterious ruins that Fabian Frost and his team found in the Glacernon area.zts23535e	Mysterious ruins? I should probably take a look. Can you tell me anything else about them?zts23536e	Unfortunately, I can't remember any details. It's best if you ask him yourself.zts23537e	I'll do that.zts23538e	Good luck, <pname>!zts23540e	Hello, adventurer. How can I help?zts23541e	Hello! Mimi sent me. She told me you'd discovered some ancient ruins.zts23542e	Oh, word sure gets around fast. We have, in fact, made some new discoveries around the ancient ice formation in the Unknown Land. A crystal containing a mysterious message about an ancient demon was dug up there recently...zts23543e	How do I get there?zts23544e	Well, you'll have to travel to the Glacernon area first. I suggest you go and have a word with the chief there. He'll be able to tell you exactly where you need to go.zts23546e	Hello Aurelius. Do you know where I can find the ancient ruins?zts23547e	Hello <pname>. Are you really that keen on finding trouble again?zts23548e	Please tell me. I've got to find out whether the ruins have anything to do with the Ancient Orc Heroes.zts23549e	Hm, the Ancient Orc Heroes... Could they really...?zts23550e	What are you getting at?zts23551e	I seem to remember that we found some inscriptions in the ruins that refer to the Ancient Heroes. But I never would have thought these heroes could be orcs.zts23552e	What was written there exactly?zts23553e	Oh, sorry, but my memory isn't as good as it was. It's probably my age. It's best if you take a look at the inscriptions yourself. I'll make the place on your map for you.zts23554e	Be careful, <pname>. There are some dangerous monsters causing trouble in the area.zts23555e	I'll be careful.zts23556e	Looking for Clueszts23557e	Hm, the ruins should be around here somewhere. But it's crawling with monsters. I'll have to get rid of them before I can keep looking.zts23559e	So, let's hope that's all of them. Let's go and find these ruins...zts23561e	(You arrive at the ice formation. An ice-cold crystal ball is floating above you.)zts23562e	Was that there the whole time?zts23563e	(You can make out some characters on the ice formation. They look like ancient inscriptions.)zts23564e	I've never seen writing like this. But I can still read it. Insane!zts23565e	'Once upon a time, four brave heroes set out to strike down the demon lord Paimon. They fought courageously but were unable to counter Paimon's power. When the battle seemed lost ... strange ... fight ... overpower their opponent ...' (Some bits are illegible.)zts23566e	'And so the heroes eventually managed to defeat the demon lord. Only those who are deemed worthy may face these heroes and request their counsel.'zts23567e	(So I'll have to find them somehow. But how will that even be possible? They've been dead for a long time.)zts23568e	(I'd better let the chief know.)zts23569e	Heroes of the Pastzts23570e	Hello, Chief Tator.zts23571e	Hello <pname>. Did you find out anything on your travels?zts23572e	Yes, but...zts23573e	(You tell the chief everything.)zts23574e	I see... So, according to the inscription, you've now got to find these heroes.zts23575e	Yes, but how am I going to manage that? They've been dead for years, haven't they?zts23576e	As far as I know, yes.zts23577e	Hmm. Pikidir might have an idea. He is the village elder. If anyone can help you, he can.zts23578e	Do you really think so?zts23579e	It can't hurt to ask him at least, hm?zts23580e	Hm, if you think so. I'll go and see him, then.zts23582e	Hey, Pikidir. I'm back.zts23583e	Oh, you got back quicker than I thought. Tell me what you've found out.zts23584e	(You tell him about the inscriptions.)zts23585e	Do you know how I can make contact with them?zts23586e	Hm, so you want to talk to the Ancient Heroes... That's impossible... For as long as you're in that body, at least.zts23587e	So the situation is hopeless...zts23588e	Well, all I said was that you can't speak to them in your current form. But your soul can.zts23589e	And how do I manage that?zts23590e	We've been using a secret Ritual Brew for generations that allows us to expand our consciousness and undertake soul journeys. Perhaps that will be the solution.zts23591e	Wow! A Ritual Brew? What do I need to make it?zts23592e	I have the recipe somewhere, but I've got the majority of the ingredients in my head anyway. You go and look for the ingredients, and I'll find the recipe. Okay? I'll even write you a list.zts23593e	Be so kind as to collect these ingredients. You can find them all here on the island.zts23594e	Double Plagues, Stir and Sizzle...zts23595e	Phew, that took longer than I thought. And you can use all this to make that brew?zts23596e	The berries need to go in next, for flavour.zts23598e	Now I've got all the ingredients. I'd better take them to Pikidir now.zts23599e	... The Cauldron Bubbles, The Fires Fizzle!zts23600e	Ah, you're back. Do you have all the ingredients we need?zts23601e	Yes, here they are.zts23602e	(You show him the ingredients you've gathered.)zts23603e	Excellent! Right, it'll just take a moment. I'll now make you my famous Ritual Brew.zts23604e	(Pikidir stirs the brew and mutters a strange incantation over it.zts23605e	He finally seems satisfied.)zts23606e	Perfect! The Ritual Brew is ready.zts23608e	This is supposed to be a mystical potion? It's smells suspiciously like alcohol...zts23609e	Just take a sip first and then you can pass judgement.zts23610e	But be careful, little warrior. Everything in moderation...zts23611e	Hm, let's give it a try. Down the hatch!zts23612e	Drink the Ritual Brewzts23613e	Hero Dreamzts23614e	(You awaken from a deep sleep and suddenly feel utterly exhausted.)zts23615e	*yawn* ... What...?zts23616e	Are you all right, <pname>?zts23617e	Where am I? What happened?zts23618e	You fell unconscious after drinking the brew. Did it work? Did you see them?zts23619e	'Them'? I...zts23620e	Concentrate! It's important that you remember! Here, I'll give you a piece of parchment. But it'll cost you...zts23621e	The Aforementioned Alchemistzts23622e	(You hold the magic parchment in your hand, and words suddenly appear on it. It looks as though your memories are being transferred directly onto the paper.)zts23623e	What the...? Oh! Now I remember.zts23624e	Pikidir! I must go and see a certain alchemist. She was in touch with the Ancient Heroes! Do you know any women in Mortaz Desert who make a living as an alchemist?zts23625e	Hm, in Mortaz Desert? I'm afraid I haven't spent much time in that part of the world...zts23626e	Damn... Then who else could I ask? Hm, Malcolm Mix might know more.zts23627e	The Heroes and the Alchemistzts23628e	Hey, Malcolm.zts23629e	Oh, h... hello, <pname>! H-How can I help you?zts23630e	Do you know of a female alchemist who works in Mortaz Desert? She must be well over a hundred years old.zts23631e	A... An alchemist? Hm... I k-know an alchemist there, b-but she d-doesn't look all that old...zts23632e	Are you sure? Is there anyone else, maybe?zts23633e	N-No, I only know this alchemist. I'll m-mark where you can find her on your map.zts23634e	Hm, well it's a start at least... Thanks, Malcolm!zts23636e	Hm, according to Malcolm, she should be around here somewhere...zts23637e	(You suddenly hear a woman's voice calling you over.)zts23638e	Hngh? Who's there?zts23639e	Over here!zts23641e	Who are you?zts23642e	I'm the alchemist you're looking for.zts23643e	How do you know I'm looking for you?zts23644e	Pure intuition. You've got this spark in your eyes... You've met the Ancient Heroes, haven't you?zts23645e	How do you know about them? Didn't they die aeons ago?zts23646e	Well, put it this way... I've developed a special oil that preserves my looks.zts23647e	Don't tell me... You didn't use up all the Ice Flower Oil!zts23648e	Hehe! So... what can I do for you?zts23649e	I wanted to ask you about the Ancient Heroes. It's imperative that I meet with them again.zts23650e	Hmm. As I'm sure you already know, they died out over a hundred years ago.zts23651e	But there has to be a way to meet them, isn't there?zts23652e	Of course there is. But first you'll need to gather a few ingredients for me.zts23653e	What do you need?zts23654e	First of all, I'll need something that contains large amounts of fire energy. You can get materials like this from the powerful monsters in the Lava Region.zts23655e	Okay, I'll make my way over there.zts23656e	Ancient Fire Magiczts23657e	Will this be enough?zts23658e	Very good, this will do nicely. Next, I'll need some specific stones containing magic power. I heard that Sand Giants carry stones like this on them.zts23659e	Could you bring me some, please?zts23660e	I'll see what I can do.zts23661e	Ancient Elementszts23662e	(Okay, this should be enough. Back to the alchemist!)zts23663e	Heroes, Old and Newzts23664e	Are these the right stones?zts23665e	Yes, thank you! These should be enough. Wait a moment, I'll get everything ready.zts23666e	(She disappears into the building. A short time later, a light appears around the door frame.)zts23667e	Right, done.zts23668e	This is a Time-Space Shard. Use it to find what you're looking for.zts23669e	You're welcome. Give them my warmest regards!zts23671e	(So the Voodoo priestess was Pikidir's daughter? I need to talk to him.)zts23672e	Sealed Togetherzts23673e	Hello, adventurer. Did you find out any more?zts23674e	Yes. I managed to find out something very... interesting.zts23675e	Oh. And what's that?zts23676e	Is it true that the voodoo priestess is your daughter?zts23677e	Well... Yes, it's true.zts23678e	Why didn't you tell me in the first place?zts23679e	I didn't want you to think I was just using you to suit my own ends.zts23680e	Hm, it would have made things a lot easier if you had been honest from the start. Never mind, let's just forget about it...zts23681e	They told me something else. Do you still have her ring?zts23682e	Oh, yes. I always keep it with me. What about it?zts23683e	Her friend told me that the ring can lead me to Paimon. And that we can use it to defeat him. Could I borrow it?zts23684e	Well, it's very valuable to me. It's the only memento I have left of her...zts23685e	I'll let you take it on one condition... Promise me you'll do everything in your power to save her!zts23686e	I swear.zts23687e	Good luck on your journey, <pname>. May the loa guide you.zts23688e	One Last Battlezts23689e	(I couldn't save her...)zts23690e	(Is this really the end?)zts23691e	(No... I'll have to tell Pikidir.)zts23692e	The Heroes' Noble Soulszts23693e	Hello, Pikidir...zts23694e	I've been anxiously awaiting your return. So, what happened?zts23695e	I wasn't strong enough. I wanted to help them destroy Paimon, but... I was too weak...zts23696e	Do you really think so?zts23697e	What do you mean? Of course! It's my fault that...zts23698e	Listen to me, little warrior. There isn't a spell in the world that can bring the dead back to life. Even I know that.zts23699e	But you were able to speak with the dead. One last time...zts23700e	Isn't that in itself more than we'd hoped for?zts23701e	And besides, you have achieved something.zts23702e	After your return, a rift opened up in the Spirit Forest.zts23703e	A power flowed through it and into our world that we haven't felt for a long time.zts23704e	They gave their lives in this battle, but it wasn't in vain. It's still possible for you to banish Paimon once and for all.zts23705e	What can I do for you, Chief Tator?zts23706e	Hello <pname>. Pikidir already told me you were back. Did everything go the way you imagined?zts23707e	Well, not exactly... But I don't think it was all for nothing.zts23708e	A good attitude. It seems doing battle with the heroes by your side taught you something important.zts23709e	Thank you! I just wish I could get stronger.zts23710e	There's more within you than you know. Since you've been back, your aura is radiating much more brightly than usual. The energy you're giving out is overpowering. I knew right away that you had made contact with our ancestors.zts23711e	There's one more thing I have to give you. When our ancestors sacrificed themselves, they didn't just die. They transferred their power to you because they knew you would complete their mission.zts23712e	They've transferred their power over to me?zts23713e	That's right. Their powers are now your powers. With them, not even Paimon will stand a chance against you. I beg you, save our village! For us... and in the name of our ancestors!zts23715e	(You wake up with a splitting headache.)zts23716e	(Where am I? How did I get here?)zts23717e	(Wasn't I just in the village?)zts23718e	(Hm, then let's see where this road goes...)zts23720e	(You notice two orcs surrounded by a handful of dark mages.)zts23721e	(Have they been cursed?)zts23722e	Must... destroy... our enemies...zts23723e	We have to... stop them...zts23724e	H... Hey! Wait a minute! I need to talk to you!zts23725e	(It doesn't look like you'll be able to persuade them...)zts23727e	Argh... What happened?zts23728e	I feel as though I've just woken from a nightmare...zts23729e	Are you all right?zts23730e	Hey, you there! What are you doing here?zts23731e	Me? Er, I wanted to...zts23732e	Are you not aware of how dangerous it is around here? We found out about a ritual a few Black Coats were planning on performing here, and we dealt with the matter.zts23733e	A ritual? What sort of ritual?zts23734e	It looks like they intended to awaken an ancient god, a creature so powerful that it could obliterate our village in one fell swoop.zts23735e	We have to stop them! Where do we find these guys?zts23736e	The must be somewhere up ahead there. We've got to get out of this forest first.zts23737e	(You stand at a fork in the path.)zts23738e	(Which way will you choose?)zts23739e	I know my way around here. If we take the right path, we could avoid most of the monsters and go for their leader directly!zts23740e	That's nonsense. I used to wander these woods with my father when I was just a nipper, so I know it like the back of my hand. The left path is a shortcut. It'll take us straight to the enemy camp, and we can surprise those ratbags!zts23741e	Never! That way is far too dangerous. We shouldn't underestimate our enemies. If we take the right path, we can easily bypass them. We'll hardly encounter any resistance to speak of!zts23742e	You're not afraid of combat, are you?zts23743e	*sigh* ... It doesn't look like we're getting anywhere. Hey, stranger! You decide which path we should take.zts23744e	Me? But I don't know it around here at all...zts23745e	That doesn't matter. I trust you to make the right decision.zts23746e	Hm, I choose the...zts23748e	See? I told you this was a shortcut!zts23749e	Right, a shortcut... right into the arms of the enemy! Look out!zts23751e	Phew, that was a tough fight...zts23752e	We should have taken the right-hand fork! We nearly carked it back there! And all because numbskull here is spoiling for a fight.zts23753e	But we defeated them, didn't we? That's all that matters.zts23754e	Ugh, you're such a brute... Let's take a break before we go any further.zts23756e	Thanks for trusting me. I won't disappoint you.zts23757e	*mumble* What a total waste of time!zts23758e	Quiet! There are enemies nearby.zts23759e	We need to sneak past them and get into the enemy camp.zts23761e	I think we've avoided most of the enemies.zts23762e	Look out! Their leader's coming!zts23763e	Grrrrrrrrr! Take arms!zts23765e	Phew, we did it!zts23766e	Yes, it's child's play if you know your enemies' weak spots.zts23767e	Bah, I could've taken those few weaklings single handedly! That was just a warmup exercise.  Harharhar!zts23769e	(You now notice a few mages running to a hiding place.)zts23770e	Cowards! You'll be feeling the sharp end of my axe!zts23771e	Oh no! We've wasted too much time. They're getting away!zts23772e	Come on, let's follow them!zts23773e	Yes. Hurry up!zts23775e	(As you enter the room, you notice the air beginning to take on a blue shimmer.)zts23776e	We're too late. They've already started summoning an ancient beast.zts23777e	Ggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!zts23778e	Look out!zts23780e	(As you bring down the enormous beast, the ground begins to shake.)zts23781e	What's going on?zts23782e	Warrior! Warrior, wake up!zts23783e	No... not yet... too early... I must ask them...zts23784e	I'd like to see you again!zts23785e	'See us again'? Hahaha...zts23786e	You must have realised what's going on here by now, little warrior. We've never seen each other before, have we?zts23787e	This is all just a dream, after all.zts23788e	No, it can't be... There must be a way!zts23789e	We have no time. Don't keep him dangling in suspense.zts23790e	Well then... If you would like to meet us, find the Alchemist in Mortaz Desert.zts23791e	She's a friend who helped us with an important mission back then. If anyone knows a way of contacting us, she does.zts23792e	An alchemist? Where can I find her?zts23793e	You'll find a way. But for that, you'll have to remember us. If you don't, all our efforts will have been for nothing.zts23794e	He's right. You must remember us.zts23795e	(Their bodies fade as you slowly come round...)zts23797e	(You look around and see multiple small pools of lava. They are blocking some of the paths.)zts23798e	(Hm, what's the best way of getting through?)zts23800e	(As you move closer, you hear the clash of weapons and... a bear growling?!)zts23801e	*roar* Out of the way!zts23802e	Ggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!zts23803e	More are coming! That one there looks dangerous. Look out, you two!zts23804e	M-Me? Hey, I'm not your enemy!zts23805e	No mercy! Attack!zts23807e	*whimper*zts23808e	I told you I'm not your enemy!zts23809e	Then who are you? And why do you look so strange?zts23810e	Hehe, I could ask you the same thing...zts23811e	You mean my bear form? I use this form to protect myself and all those I hold dear.zts23812e	We should calm down a bit first. So, who are you? And what are you doing in such a dangerous area?zts23813e	I'm looking for the Ancient Heroes. An alchemist sent me here, but it doesn't look like the right place...zts23814e	Well, that's not entirely true.zts23815e	What do you mean?zts23816e	Well... We also belong to the Ancient Heroes. Hm, you look confused. Not quite what you were expecting?zts23817e	Or is my little wolf making you nervous? He won't do anything; he just wants to play.zts23818e	(The wolf pants at you expectantly and wags his tail happily.)zts23819e	I don't know... I actually thought I would find a hulk of an axeman with a huge axe, and a voodoo priestess with purple skin and ornate hair. That's how they appeared in my dream, at least.zts23820e	A dream? Did you hit your head in battle, maybe?zts23821e	No, the people from the village helped me. Pikidir, the village alchemist, prepared a special brew that will enable me to meet the heroes.zts23822e	Pikidir sent you?!zts23823e	Yes. Do you know him?zts23824e	Um, yes... But let's keep going a bit first. We still have a long road ahead of us. Let's go!zts23826e	There's a fork in the path here. If we want to get out of here, we'll have to clear these areas of monsters in a specific order.zts23827e	How do you know that?zts23828e	Well, I am a Flame Druid. I know this area well. We should head east and then...zts23829e	Okay. East it is, then.zts23831e	(An exit has opened in the south.)zts23833e	(An exit has opened in the north.)zts23835e	(An exit has opened in the west.)zts23837e	(An exit has opened in the east.)zts23839e	(An exit has opened in the north.)zts23841e	So...zts23842e	You said you met a voodoo priestess and an axeman, right?zts23843e	Yes, but only in a dream...zts23844e	I don't think it was just a dream. The people you mentioned are our friends. You appeared just as we were about to meet them.zts23845e	There was an emergency in our village, which is why I turned to my friend, the Flame Druid.zts23846e	Oh, he lives here?zts23847e	Of course! The heat here suits me down to the ground. Unfortunately, there aren't any places like it on our island.zts23848e	Why did Pikidir send you? Has something happened to the voodoo priestess?zts23849e	I don't think I need to tell you every last detail. But yes, it's possible she's in danger.zts23850e	Why do you ask about her?zts23851e	Because Pikidir sent you.zts23852e	And what's that got to do with the voodoo priestess?zts23853e	Pikidir is her father. You didn't know?zts23854e	!!! ... (Why didn't he tell me anything about it?)zts23855e	But tell me now... What's going on here? Do you know anything about Paimon?zts23856e	That's what I wanted to ask you about. Do you know how...zts23857e	Psst! Can you hear that?zts23858e	(You were about to ask your question when, suddenly, the ground beings to shake.)zts23859e	We can talk to later. We're running out of time! We need to get a move on!zts23861e	Uff... What did that ancient beast want here? And why did it attack us?zts23862e	I haven't the faintest idea. Perhaps it was summoned here by dark forces?zts23863e	Warriors, we don't have much time. We need to prepare for battle with Paimon.zts23864e	I'd like to help you. Is there anything I can do?zts23865e	You wouldn't be much help. We have to meet up with the other villagers first and plan our next move.zts23866e	I wanted to ask you another thing. Do you know how to seal away Paimon?zts23867e	I'm not sure if there's a way to seal him away for good. Many of our comrades have already paid with their lives to keep him far away from our village.zts23868e	To stave off a creature as mighty as he is, we'd honestly need a miracle.zts23869e	But I want to help you save the world!zts23870e	And you want to see the voodoo priestess again, right?zts23871e	Go and talk to her father.zts23872e	Because she was always losing things, she cast spells on her possessions. A sort of invisible string. So if you find something of hers, it will lead you to her.zts23873e	She was particularly fond of her ring - you'll definitely be able to use it to find her.zts23874e	Go now, little warrior. Our time here is up.zts23875e	Will we meet again?zts23876e	Haha, don't worry. If you find a way of contacting her, we'll be by her side.zts23877e	We're counting on you.zts23879e	Oh, look - our little warrior!zts23880e	Greetings, <pname>! My friend told me all about you.zts23881e	You seem familiar. Have we met before? No, that's not possible...zts23882e	It's good to see you again! We'll take all the help we can get.zts23883e	I'm so pleased to see you all again! How do we want to proceed?zts23884e	Well, our plan hasn't changed much. We were able to locate the places where the dark energy is coming from, and we're now planning on catching Paimon.zts23885e	If we combine our powers, he won't stand a chance!zts23886e	That might be true, but we can't afford to be careless. This will be our hardest battle.zts23887e	We'll give it our all. Don't disappoint us!zts23888e	We're counting on you, <pname>!zts23889e	We can do this! Now we'll show this Paimon what real heroes are made of!zts23891e	Wait! There's a dreadful smell over here.zts23892e	Grrrrrrrrrzts23893e	They're Paimon's elite troops.zts23894e	Bah, we'll butcher anything that gets in our way. Won't we, <pname>?zts23895e	We could go round them but then we'll be under attack from two sides. It's no use, we'll have to fight them.zts23896e	It's settled, then.zts23897e	Hurry!zts23899e	(The ground shakes with dark energy as your group draws closer to the enemy.)zts23900e	It's time! The moment we've all been waiting for for so long has finally come!zts23901e	Take arms, friends!zts23902e	You'll pay for what you've done, Paimon!zts23903e	The loa will never forgive you!zts23904e	(I have a bad feeling... As though something awful is about to happen.)zts23906e	My axe isn't having any effect on Paimon! This isn't right.zts23907e	Wait. This is strange... Where are we now?zts23908e	Stupid question! This is the dimensional rift Paimon caused.zts23909e	So we've made it.zts23910e	That sounds plausible. I was wondering why my powers were useless.zts23911e	Ha, you stupid orcs. This is my refuge where I can regain my powers.zts23912e	Hm? Heh, human! I know you. You took me down on the Celestial Spire. Welcome to my kingdom!zts23913e	(Paimon begins to cast a strange spell.)zts23914e	No! <pname>!zts23915e	Don't you dare lay a finger on my friends!zts23916e	We have no choice! We must escape before Paimon completes his spell.zts23917e	Where do we go?zts23918e	I'm sensing a portal behind Paimon. I'll distract him. Go, get moving!zts23919e	Run!zts23921e	Is everyone all right?zts23922e	Yes, everything's fine.zts23923e	My furry friend's all right, too.zts23924e	Luckily, nothing happened to my axe!zts23925e	Hm, this place seems familiar. Don't you think, my friends?zts23926e	Yes. We're somewhere in Moritius.zts23927e	If that portal leads to Moritius...zts23928e	... Then Paimon is intending to attack the island again!zts23929e	Ha, I can finally get my revenge!zts23930e	It won't be easy to defeat Paimon in his dimension.zts23931e	But if he dares to leave, we'll be in with a chance.zts23932e	Okay. We should warn the village that Paimon is on his way here.zts23933e	That's a good idea. Hurry!zts23938e	(As you enter the forest, the surroundings become more and more familiar.)zts23939e	Ha, this is the Spirit Forest!zts23940e	Paimon will start his invasion here. He'll corrupt the Spirit Forest again.zts23941e	We'll defend the sacred forest!zts23942e	We should prepare ourselves for Paimon's arrival.zts23943e	Indeed. Let's get to the village!zts23944e	I can feel his dark energy. He's close.zts23945e	Oh no! We're not too late, are we?zts23946e	Hm, the intensity of the dark energy hasn't increased. So he hasn't fully regained his power yet.zts23947e	My axes are thirsty for Paimon's blood!zts23954e	My powers have finally returned. You mortal maggots fancy your chances against me, do you? You buffoons! I'm invincible now!zts23955e	We don't have any other choice...zts23956e	Hm?zts23957e	You know what to do.zts23958e	(The wolf hangs his head and whines. He knows what fate awaits him...)zts23959e	To seal Paimon, we must...zts23960e	If we can detain Paimon in this dimension, he won't be able to harm our village. Use the time to escape, <pname>!zts23961e	What? But I want to stay with you!zts23962e	(She smiles.) We will meet again, I promise you.zts23963e	This is our destiny. But I still wish I could have told papa goodbye. Save yourself so our sacrifice isn't in vain.zts23964e	We will always be by your side, watching over you. For all eternity. The loa will protect you.zts23965e	Take care of yourself, little warrior. Now run to the portal in the forest!zts23966e	(Just as Paimon is ending his devastating spell, you are bathed in a blazing light. The light protects you like a shield.)zts23967e	Ancient Heroes' Questszts23968e	Select a quest.zts23969e	Searching for Ancient Heroes (Specialist Card Quest)zts23970e	Return of Evil (Daily)zts23971e	Paimon may have been defeated in the final battle... but he still lives!zts23972e	He's trying to conquer the Spirit Forest again.zts23973e	Use the power of the Ancient Heroes to seal him away.zts23974e	Yes.

However, according to the data from the tracking device, the stolen equipment is in a very dangerous area.zts24077e	Would you help us get our equipment back?zts24078e	Hey, <pname>. Due to the high number of monsters springing up, we lack the minerals we need to produce weapons.zts24079e	Would you eliminate the monsters?zts24082e	Supermarketzts24083e	Food Shortagezts24084e	Trouble at the Ranchzts24085e	A full stomach is the be-all and end-all for our soldiers.zts24086e	We're slowly running out of food, though. Would you get some food for us?zts24087e	Our ranch is being threatened by aggressive monsters.zts24088e	I need your help, <pname>.zts24090e	NosBazaarzts24091e	Accessory Shopzts24092e	Dangerous Transport Routezts24093e	Our convoy is in danger.zts24094e	Please help us, <pname>!zts24096e	Alchemist's Shopzts24097e	Punchy Potionzts24098e	Supplies of Anti-Venom Potionszts24099e	Supplies of Anti-Cold Potionszts24100e	Hey, <pname>. Could you give me a hand?zts24101e	Many soldiers were wounded in the fight against the dragons.zts24102e	We're short of medicine and the number of seriously wounded is steadily rising.zts24103e	We need some potent medicine to treat your wounds.zts24104e	I've developed a new remedy.zts24105e	Although I'm going to need some materials to make it. Would you get them for me, <pname>?zts24106e	We've sent soldiers to observe the Zombie Dragon. They'll need some Anti-Venom Potions for this task. Unfortunately, we don't have the necessary materials to make some.zts24107e	Could you bring me the materials?zts24108e	We've sent soldiers to observe the Ice Dragon. They'll need some Anti-Cold Potions for this task. Unfortunately, we don't have the necessary materials to make some.zts24110e	Teleportation Tower (Dragonveil)zts24111e	To Port Alveus Square (25,000)zts24112e	To NosVille (25,000)zts24113e	To Western Krem (25,000)zts24115e	Wow! Is that... a dragon? So that light that fell from the sky was a dragon.zts24116e	(You cautiously touch the dragon's body.)zts24117e	Hmm, no pulse. The dragon must have died from the fall.zts24118e	(You see a saddle on the dragon's back.)zts24119e	A saddle? That means someone was riding this dragon. But where are they?zts24120e	Hm? Wait a sec... Is that a person under its right wing?zts24121e	(You manage to lift the dragon's wing. A strange-looking girl is revealed.)zts24122e	Oh, she's got horns on her head. I've never seen anything like it. Hey, wake up!zts24123e	She must have been knocked out from the fall. I'd better take her to Carven. He'll take good care of her.zts24125e	Uncle Carven, I need your help!zts24126e	Who's that girl on your back? She's very pale. Quickly, lay her down here. I'll examine her.zts24127e	(You lay her on the bed and Carven starts examining her.)zts24128e	Her pulse is weak but she's alive.zts24129e	She doesn't seem to have any injuries.zts24130e	I don't know why she won't wake up. Did you find her in that area you mentioned? Was there anything else?zts24131e	She was lying under the wing of a dead dragon.zts24132e	I think she must have been riding the dragon.zts24133e	A horned girl and a dragon... Hmm... That light last night... So that was a dragon. Hmm, that makes sense.zts24134e	Well, we need to wake her up somehow. Maybe she has internal injuries. I can make something to take care of that. Would you fetch the necessary ingredients for me?zts24135e	Of course!zts24137e	(Right, that's everything. Hopefully the medicine will work.)zts24139e	Here. How is she doing?zts24140e	Her condition hasn't changed.zts24141e	I'll make the remedy now. Wait a moment.zts24142e	(Carven prepares the ingredients and then sets about making the remedy.)zts24143e	Right, done. Let's give her the medicine.zts24144e	I hope this works.zts24145e	(He carefully gives her the medicine.)zts24146e	It'll take a little while for the medicine to take effect. Come back a bit later.zts24147e	Understood. Hopefully the remedy will work.zts24149e	How is she, Uncle Carven?zts24150e	She's still unconscious.zts24151e	Her body seems unscathed. Perhaps her soul took some damage...zts24152e	Her soul? Oh, then I might know someone who can help!zts24153e	Really? That's lucky! Then go and find this person. But hurry before her condition gets any worse!zts24154e	I'm already on my way. See you later!zts24155e	(I've got to go to Moritius and visit Pikidir.)zts24157e	Pikidir, I need your help!zts24158e	Oh, long time no see, <pname>! To what do I owe the honour?zts24159e	Well, it concerns the following...zts24160e	(You tell Pikidir what happened at Mount Krem.)zts24161e	A dragon rider with horns? Interesting. I read of a people related to dragons in old records.zts24162e	Our ancestors once maintained good relations with these people, but then they disappeared all of a sudden.zts24163e	So you want to find a remedy that will heal her soul?zts24164e	Yes. Can you help?zts24165e	Quite! I know how we can help the girl.zts24166e	I know a spell that heals souls wounded by demons.zts24167e	You'll need some materials to cast the spell.zts24168e	Here's a list. Once you've brought me everything I need, I'll check the materials over and then teach you the spell.zts24169e	Sounds good. I'll bring everything to you!zts24171e	Here are the materials we need, Pikidir.zts24172e	Let me see. Hmm... Yes, everything that we need is here. Now pay attention!zts24173e	First we've got to grind up all the materials and mix them together. Then you'll need to sprinkle the powder around the girl and light it.zts24174e	Finally, you must recite the following spell:zts24175e	'Almighty Loa, this girl needs your help.zts24176e	Heal her soul and lead her out of the darkness onto the right path.'zts24177e	That's it. She should then be healed.zts24178e	That does sound easy. Is there anything else I need to be aware of?zts24179e	Well, this spell has only been used on orcs up until now.zts24180e	But the Loa certainly won't discriminate. As long as she's a good person, they'll stand by her.zts24181e	Hurry up and help this girl.zts24182e	Thank you! (I must get back to the girl and help her.)zts24184e	Wh... Where am I? Water... Please, give me some water!zts24185e	You're finally awake. Here, but drink slowly.zts24186e	*cough*... Thank you! That was good.zts24187e	I'm <pname>, and this is Carven. And what's your name?zts24188e	I'm Ain, <pname>. Where is my dragon?zts24189e	I'm sorry but... the dragon was already dead when we found you. You're not from here, are you? What happened to you both?zts24190e	Oh no... my poor, loyal Kurus! *sob* I'm a Draconian and come from another continent.zts24191e	You're bound to have lots of questions but I don't have time for this!zts24192e	My home is in great danger! I came here to find help.zts24193e	Please help me, <pname>! You've got to save my home, I'm begging you!zts24194e	What? Me?zts24195e	According to my Salutari detector, you're the chosen one.zts24196e	Er, Salu... What's that, then?zts24197e	This is a device that measures a being's energy. And your readings are off the charts... So much so the charts are dead and buried, so to speak! You truly are strong enough to save my homeland.zts24198e	Will you help me? Oh, what am I saying, you've GOT to help me! Come on!zts24199e	(She grabs you by the arm and pulls.)zts24200e	Hey, wait! Where are you going?zts24201e	I've got to go to Kurus, my dragon. Please take me to him.zts24202e	(Ain goes outside.)zts24203e	Come on, hurry up!zts24204e	Er, she might have a temper... But I can't very well let her go by herself. Uncle Carve, I'll accompany Ain.zts24205e	Okay. But take care of yourselves!zts24207e	So, I found you right here. What do we do now?zts24208e	I've got to find my things that Kurus was carrying on his back.zts24209e	Please wait here, <pname>.zts24210e	Poor Kurus... Rest in peace.zts24211e	(Ain searches for her belongings.)zts24212e	Ah, there they are.zts24213e	What sort of stones are these?zts24214e	They're not stones; they're dragon bones.zts24215e	Dragon bones?zts24216e	Yes. We call them 'Motus'. They possess a mystical power that links two places together.zts24217e	We can use this stone to travel to Celestial Lair.zts24218e	Isn't that dangerous?zts24219e	Not at all. However, we need certain materials for this.zts24220e	And what, exactly? Sick bags in case we get airsick?zts24221e	No. We're going to need gold coins.zts24222e	Gold coins?zts24223e	Yes. An large amount of energy is required for teleportation in order for it to work perfectly. This energy is extracted from gold. Ergo, we need gold coins.zts24224e	I don't really get why we need gold for this, but if you think... Shall we go?zts24225e	We'll be at danger's mercy during teleportation.zts24226e	So me must go through with it somewhere safe.zts24227e	We could do it in the Krem chief's house.zts24228e	That sounds good. I'll wait for you there. Let me know when you're ready.zts24229e	Okay. See you!zts24231e	This is Celestial Lair.zts24232e	(You look around.)zts24233e	Oh, we're above the clouds! Are we on top of a mountain?zts24234e	No. Celestial Lair is a continent that floats in the sky... As the name suggests.zts24235e	What? We're floating in the sky?!zts24236e	This continent was once an island in the sea. It used to be called 'Dracowall'.zts24237e	But how did the island end up in the sky all of a sudden?zts24238e	The island was attacked by demons a long time ago. Our ancestors and the dragons stood and faced them.zts24239e	We were able to push them back but we paid a high price for it. Many dragons and Draconians lost their lives.zts24240e	That's awful...zts24241e	We had to find a better way of protecting our homeland from attack. We combined our people's technology with dragon magic, through which we succeeded in lifting the whole island into the air.zts24242e	That's incredible!zts24243e	So Celestial Lair remained hidden away from the world for many centuries and we thought we were safe.zts24244e	Those were happy and peaceful times.zts24245e	The flip side was that we couldn't contact the outside world.zts24246e	We were only able to communicate with the dragons.zts24247e	Our isolation brought many problems along with it.zts24248e	That's why we tried to 're-land' the content.zts24249e	So your plan obviously didn't work, hm?zts24250e	Indeed. Asgobas, a powerful dragon lord, fed his magic into a huge machine that set the whole island floating in the air. This was the arrangement between the dragons and Draconians after the demon attack. And Asgobas swore never to break this pact.zts24251e	We believed we could slowly sink the island back down if we reversed Asgobas' magic power.zts24252e	I developed a machine that maintains a steady flow of magic but reverses it at the same time. That was the only way we could make sure our home was stable. I implanted this device into Asgobas' body. We had to trick Asgobas in order to do it. Unfortunately, it didn't really work as I'd imagined. Asgobas was beside himself with rage and completely lost it. In a furious temper, he started reducing our home to rubble. Not one stone remained untouched and many Draconians fell victim to the dragon.zts24253e	My goodness...zts24254e	Yes. And it was all my fault. We didn't know what to do. That's why I decided to seek help. But Asgobas guessed what I was up to and attacked me. Kurus was wounded and that's why we fell onto your continent... And then you found us.zts24255e	So you risked your life to find me... Well then, I'll do everything in my power to help you!zts24256e	Thank you, <pname>. From the bottom of my heart! We should go and see the mayor of my town next.zts24258e	Hello Mr Mayor!zts24259e	You have returned! I was very worried.zts24260e	Oh, who's this you've brought with you?zts24261e	Hello, I'm <pname>. I'm from a different continent.zts24262e	Pleased to meet you. I'm Mayor Caesar. Welcome to our town... Or what's left of it following the dragon attack.zts24263e	What's the situation?zts24264e	Things are only getting worse, I'm afraid.zts24265e	The animals and monsters in the area became more and more aggressive after the attack. Unpleasant incidents keep occurring.zts24266e	We can't deal with everything. We've got our hands full rebuilding the town and building defences against further dragon attacks.zts24267e	I think the priority would be to guarantee our town's stability so that we can bring in supplies from outside.zts24268e	I'd be happy to help you.zts24269e	Really? Thank you, I appreciate it. If Ain trusts you, then I do too.zts24270e	Where's the best place to start?zts24271e	There are three people needing help right now. Rancher Emily, Captain Enrico and Quartermaster Marto.zts24272e	You'll have to take care of that by yourself - I have something else to discuss with the mayor.zts24273e	No problem, I can manage. I'd better start with the ranch.zts24274e	Hey, wait! I have something for you here. It's an anti-gravity device.zts24275e	And what do you use it for?zts24276e	Celestial Lair consists of multiple floating islands. To get from one to the other, you need to use the Skytrails.zts24277e	Aren't there any bridges?zts24278e	Bridges wouldn't be stable enough.zts24279e	That's why we've developed this equipment.zts24280e	So I can use it to fly?zts24281e	Yes, but the devices only work at Celestial Lair.zts24282e	Too bad.zts24283e	You'll like it. The feeling you get when you run through the air is something else!zts24284e	I can hardly wait to try out the device!zts24286e	Are you Emily?zts24287e	That's me. You do look strange. Where are you from?zts24288e	I'm from a different continent. My name is <pname>.zts24289e	Ain brought me here. She asked me for help.zts24290e	Ah, it's you! Pleased to meet you. But what brings you to my ranch?zts24291e	(Ain seems to be well respected here.)zts24292e	The mayor asked me to help you with your problems. So what can I do for you?zts24293e	Oh, wonderful, you're just in time!zts24294e	To get to my ranch, you need to cross a gorge. The animals and monsters that live there always used to be placid. But now they're all extremely aggressive and are attacking travellers.zts24295e	So we're cut off from the outside world here. And our supplies are slowly running out.zts24296e	It would be wonderful if you could get rid of the monsters in the gorge.zts24297e	No problem! I'll take care of it. So where is this gorge?zts24298e	If you take the path out of town to the right, you'll come straight to the gorge. But be careful!zts24300e	That should be enough. There's hardly a dangerous monster anywhere to be seen. Time to go back to the ranch.zts24302e	I've dealt with most of the monsters in the gorge. You can cross it safely again now.zts24303e	Thank you so much! I'll see to the ranch now.zts24304e	Can I ask for your help again if the ranch comes under threat in the future?zts24305e	Of course, I'm happy to help!zts24306e	(Right, now I'm talking with the captain.)zts24308e	(That one looks rather like a captain.)zts24309e	Hey, stranger! Why are you staring at me like that?zts24310e	I'm <pname> and I come from NosVille. It's on another continent. Ain brought me here.zts24311e	Oh, so you're the stranger Ain risked her life to bring here. I'm very pleased to meet you!zts24312e	The mayor asked me to help you. What do you need?zts24313e	Hmm, are you experienced in combat?zts24314e	Well, I'm an adventurer. Defending one's own skin is part of the trade.zts24315e	Great! Since we've lived in peace for hundreds of years, we're rather short of capable fighters. Most of our soldiers are really hunters.zts24316e	Even I didn't have the luxury of combat training; I was a hunter myself before I was made captain.zts24317e	Lots of soldiers were killed or badly wounded in the last dragon attack.zts24318e	That's why we must now fill the ranks with new recruits.zts24319e	And they of course must be trained first, correct?zts24320e	Got it in one! Our veterans are busy fighting the aggressive monsters around the town. So we need someone with experience to teach the recruits everything they need.zts24321e	And what exactly should I teach them?zts24322e	Well, the most important thing is probably for them to learn how to handle a weapon. If an experienced adventurer like you shows them a trick or two, it'll strengthen their morale and make proper fighters out of them.zts24323e	Then we'll have an army of courageous soldiers in no time!zts24324e	I see. So where can I find the recruits?zts24325e	They're out on the Frozen Lake as we speak. You should definitely find a good spot for training there.zts24326e	All right. Would you tell me how to get to the lake?zts24327e	You need to head north out of the town. But bear in mind it's dreadfully cold there. Make sure you're well prepared before you set off.zts24328e	Thanks for the information. See you later!zts24330e	(Hmm, this is probably the place the captain meant. All right, let's go!)zts24332e	I should report to the captain about the training. Besides, I'm freezing my butt off! I'm already looking forward to getting warmed up in the town. *shiver*zts24334e	So, the training has been successfully completed.zts24335e	Well done. What do you think of my recruits?zts24336e	They were eager to get started and got the hang of things quickly.zts24337e	Haha, I knew it! All they needed was a little nudge.zts24338e	They just overdid it a bit and wore themselves out too fast.zts24339e	Yes, that's understandable. Many of them lost friends and family when the dragon attacked. They want to avenge the dead. But their overzealousness could be their downfall... Thanks for the advice and your commitment!zts24340e	My pleasure.zts24341e	You're going to see the quartermaster, right?zts24342e	Yes, that's right.zts24343e	Marto came by a short while ago to report to me. I've already informed him you'll be paying him a visit.zts24344e	Thank you! Bye for now!zts24346e	Hello, I'm...zts24347e	Ah, I've been waiting for you. The captain said you'd be coming to see me. Thank you in advance for your help, <pname>!zts24348e	Oh, don't mention it. How can I be of help?zts24349e	We need heaps of swords because our weapons always wear out so quickly fighting against dragons. Dragons have very thick, hard scales, you know.zts24350e	That's why we're constantly producing new blades.zts24351e	We're running out of materials, though. The reason for that, as I'm sure you've already guessed, is the increased presence of monsters in the area.zts24352e	So you need me to defeat the monsters and get the necessary materials. Is that right?zts24353e	Ooh, are you a mind reader or something? That's precisely what I wanted to ask you. The material we need for producing weapons - Dratanium, as it's known - can be found in the Gravel Gorge. Would you eliminate the monsters and collect the Dratanium for us?zts24354e	Of course. How do I get to the Gravel Gorge?zts24355e	Just take the left path out of town. That will take you straight to the Gravel Gorge.zts24357e	That should be enough. Now I'll take the Dratanium back to Marto.zts24359e	Here. Dratanium fresh from the Gravel Gorge! Is this enough or do you need more?zts24360e	This should be enough for now. Thank you!zts24361e	Oh, I heard something bad apparently happened at the ranch. A troop of soldiers has set off for there in a hurry. The captain asked me to tell you that you should get over to the ranch as quickly as possible.zts24362e	Hmm, then I'd better hurry. I'll set off now. See you later!zts24363e	Be careful! The captain sounded very worried.zts24365e	Hmm, it sounds like there's fighting nearby. I'd better get a move on!zts24367e	I didn't really expect the ranch to be such a dangerous place.zts24369e	Captain Enrico! What happened here?zts24370e	Thank you for coming so quickly.zts24371e	Do you remember those recruits you trained?zts24372e	Yes, of course. What about the soldiers?zts24373e	You did warn me that they were a bit hot-blooded. Some of them set off to hunt the dragons who have their family and friends on their conscience.zts24374e	Oh, that wasn't a good idea.zts24375e	Quite! I've already dispatched a few veterans to rescue the recruits but I don't think they'll arrive in time.zts24376e	That's why I'd like to ask you to go and look for the recruits.zts24377e	Don't worry, I'll sort it. I'll rescue the soldiers and bring them home safely.zts24378e	Thank you. They must have made it to the other side of the Frozen Lake by now and will probably reach the Ice Dungeon soon. Please leave at once.zts24380e	(Ah, there's one of the recruits over there. It's lucky I spotted him. I'll rescue him.)zts24382e	Hey, are you okay? Can you walk?zts24383e	Oh, Instructor <pname>! Have you come to rescue us?zts24384e	Yes, I can walk, thanks.zts24385e	Some of my comrades... They... didn't make it. And it's all my fault!zts24386e	Calm down! Let's just concentrate on staying alive first. Stay close to me. I'll get us out of here.zts24388e	We've got to escape from this dungeon.zts24390e	Careful, adventurer, there are a lot of monsters here.zts24391e	Don't worry. We can do this! Remember your training. Together, we'll give these monsters a run for their money!zts24393e	We've done it! Now we can go back to the town.zts24395e	Captain, I've brought the recruits back.zts24396e	I'm sorry, Captain...zts24397e	You truly are a great hero, <pname>! You've brought back most of the recruits without so much as a scratch.zts24398e	And, young man, it wasn't your fault! I take full responsibility. My failure is on me. But this incident has taught me an important lesson. Now go back to the barracks and get some rest. Dismissed, soldier!zts24399e	It's lucky that nearly all of the recruits have returned home.zts24400e	<pname>, I received a message from Ain while you were away.zts24401e	Oh, what is it?zts24402e	We're holding a meeting soon to discuss how we can defend the town from the next dragon attack. We also need to clarify how we're going to successfully pacify Asgobas. Would you come along, too?zts24403e	Hmm, that sounds like a very confidential meeting. I'm just a stranger.  Should I really take part?zts24404e	Of course! You were chosen by Ain. And we could really use your help and advice!zts24405e	Ain seems to hold a lot of respect among your people. Why is that?zts24406e	You don't know?zts24407e	Well, she is the world's best inventor! And besides, she's one of the most influential and leading researchers of the Draconian Academy.zts24408e	Wow! The fact that she's already achieved so much at such a tender age... That's really impressive!zts24409e	Haha, indeed! She's wonderful. Come on, let's go to the meeting.zts24411e	Hello Captain. And welcome, stranger!zts24412e	We have answered your call, Academy President.zts24413e	(The academy president is probably the leader of Dragonveil.)zts24414e	Thank you for inviting me.zts24415e	Please, take a seat. I hereby open the meeting. Would you like to start, Ain?zts24416e	Yes. Firstly, I'd like to report on the current situation.zts24417e	It seems impossible to counter Asgobas' powerful magic. The portal can only be maintained with great difficulty. That's also the reason why we cannot expect any reinforcements from the adventurer's world.zts24418e	Without reinforcements, we'll be helplessly at the dragons' mercy.zts24419e	You're right. But I might have a solution. We could destroy the magic reversal device, 'Gordio', in Asgobas' body.zts24420e	How can we destroy it?zts24421e	The device must be shut down manually. That's why we have no other choice but to penetrate Asgobas' body once we've defeated him.zts24422e	But our army doesn't stand a chance against Asgobas!zts24423e	Indeed. We couldn't even get through his skin.zts24424e	But the adventurer uses weapons that are different to ours. Maybe he will manage to wound Asgobas.zts24425e	And I've got another idea.zts24426e	And those would be?zts24427e	I'm about to make a breakthrough in developing new weapons which should be very effective against the dragons.zts24428e	That sounds good! When will these weapons be ready?zts24429e	I'm afraid I don't have the necessary materials right now.zts24430e	So what do you need?zts24431e	Dragon Skin, Dratanium and a few other things. And above all a gigantic, magical energy source!zts24432e	I'll need a large quantity of Dragon Crystals again to make it.zts24433e	These crystals are very rare, though, seeing as they're only to be found in dragons' lairs. It'll be next to impossible to get as many as we need.zts24434e	Yes, these caves are very dangerous. But you shouldn't underestimate <pname>!zts24435e	Hmm, what do you think, Enrico?zts24436e	The adventurer is stronger and bolder than you think! I believe he can do it with our support.zts24437e	This task sounds very risky but I don't think there's any way around it. I'll be expecting an appropriate reward for it, though! *wink*zts24438e	I wouldn't want that to be the reason this fails. I guarantee you'll be duly rewarded.zts24439e	Excellent! You are now officially my assistant, <pname>. Your first task is to get hold of the required materials for me.zts24441e	Right, I hereby end this meeting. Dismissed!zts24442e	We still need to talk about developing the new weapons, adventurer. Wait a moment.zts24444e	What do you need?zts24445e	You need to get the materials for making the new weapons.zts24446e	The first five materials you've got to get are Dragon Skin, Eternal Ice, Dratanium, Dragon Crystals and Dense Dragon's Breath.zts24447e	All right. Is that everything?zts24448e	No, but we'll get the rest.zts24449e	Okay. I'll be on my way, then.zts24450e	The Dragon Skin, Dratanium and Eternal Ice take priority. I'll use those to make the weapons' basic shape.zts24451e	You can loot Dragon Skin from the dragons near the town, and the Dratanium from the Gravel Gorge.zts24452e	Eternal Ice you can obtain as loot from defeated monsters in the Ice Dungeon.zts24453e	All right. I'll be back with the materials soon.zts24455e	I'm back. Here.zts24456e	Great! Just two more materials to get now. But they're hard to come by.zts24457e	You mean the Dragon Crystals and the Dense Dragon's Breath, right?zts24458e	That's right. The crystals and flowers are only found in places where dragons have stayed for a long time.zts24459e	Flowers?zts24460e	Yes. 'Dense Dragon's Breath' is a flower grown through dragon's breath... As the name suggests.zts24461e	Ah, now I understand. That makes sense.zts24462e	Yeah, this flower is really very beautiful.zts24463e	You'll find these rare materials in the Ancient Dragon's Lair connected to the other dragon lairs.zts24464e	Oho, there are bound to be lots of powerful dragons there.zts24465e	Indeed it is. Dragon Crystals and Dense Dragon's Breath can only arise from strong dragon magic.zts24466e	You must first defeat the guardians of the cave and capture special magic spheres to escape from the Ancient Dragon's Lair. Think of it as a kind of test.zts24467e	Ugh... That sounds like it would be really, really dangerous.zts24468e	Yes, it's not easy to find this place, let alone get inside.zts24469e	Here, I'll give you a tracking device, a so-called 'Lymor'. You can use it to find the lair. It shows you when powerful dragon magic is active close by.zts24470e	Okay, thank you. I might be feeling a bit queasy, but I'll do it.zts24471e	Be careful!zts24473e	Right, now I have all the guardians' magic spheres. Now I've just got to find locations where dragon magic is very strong. Luckily, I have the tracking device for that!zts24475e	Are these all the materials you need?zts24476e	Yes, thanks to your help I've got everything I need. I'll start producing the weapons now.zts24477e	And what should I do in the meantime?zts24478e	Oh, I almost forgot. Quartermaster Marto wanted to talk to you. Go and see him.zts24479e	Aha, I'm sure he's also going to be needing some materials. I'll be off to see Marto, then.zts24481e	Hellooo, Marto! You wanted to talk to me?zts24482e	Ah, hello adventurer. I've been waiting for you.zts24483e	What's going on?zts24484e	We're trying to get the materials for the new weapons - the ones you're not getting hold of - from the Gravel Gorge and dragon lairs. However, our wagon convoy was attacked by monsters. Ain doesn't know anything about it.zts24485e	Ooh, that doesn't sound good.zts24486e	That's what the reports are saying, at least. That's why I'd like to ask you to check with Pavio.zts24487e	He's responsible for the transport and will surely be able to tell you more.zts24488e	All right, I'll make my way over there now.zts24490e	Oh, I'm so glad you're here, adventurer.zts24491e	Pleased to meet you. So, where are these wagons then?zts24492e	All we know is that they're near the Gravel Gorge.zts24493e	They are under guard but the situation seems to have got out of control. Please help them!zts24494e	Gravel Gorge, you say? I'm already on my way!zts24496e	Right, done. I'd better get back to the town.zts24498e	I'm back, Pavio.zts24499e	Oh, hello there, adventurer! The wagon convoy has just arrived. Thank you so much.zts24500e	Unfortunately I wasn't able to save all the wagons carrying materials.zts24501e	Then we'll just have to collect some more.zts24502e	You've rescued my people, so the mission was a success.zts24503e	Yeah, you think so?zts24504e	I'd like to give you something as a token of my gratitude. Here.zts24505e	Oh, Captain Enrico is looking for you by the way. He said it was urgent.zts24506e	All right. Bye for now. (I hope nothing bad has happened...)zts24508e	Oh, <pname>! I've been waiting for you. We've got trouble.zts24509e	The new weapons Ain developed were stolen by strangers when we took them to the place we wanted to test them.zts24510e	Oh no! That's not good news.zts24511e	We're worried we've got a spy in our ranks. I did suspect Ain for a moment because she reacted so calmly when she found out.zts24512e	Impossible, that can't be right.zts24513e	Of course not. She said she knew this would happen. And that she already had a solution ready.zts24514e	Well that sounds promising. And what exactly is she suggesting?zts24515e	That you'll take care of the matter. Ain asked me to give you this device.zts24516e	(Enrico gives you a strange pole, to which a monitor and antennae are attached.)zts24517e	Ain said it's a tracking device. She called it... Hmm... I've forgotten the name. Anyway, it can track down the stolen weapons.zts24518e	Ah, I see. Something's flashing on the monitor.zts24519e	Very good. Ain said she'd built some kind of tracker into the weapons. The signal is transmitted to this device at regular intervals.zts24520e	This lets you see where the weapons have been taken.zts24521e	I see. A great piece! Oh, where is Ain actually?zts24522e	She's in her lab tinkering with other things that can provide support.zts24523e	All right. I'll do everything in my power to get the weapons back.zts24525e	Ah, the device is showing there's a weapon here. And the next one is...zts24527e	... In the dragon's lair. *gulp*zts24529e	Here's another one. I should defeat the monsters first before I keep looking.zts24531e	I've defeated all the monsters. Now I can look for the next weapon.zts24533e	(Oh, they're Draconians. They're guarding a large box. Ain's weapons must be inside.)zts24534e	(I wonder why the Draconians stole the weapons... Never mind, I just need to get them back.)zts24536e	I wanted to talk to them first but they attacked me straight away. If these soldiers are the captain's men, then they should actually know me. Hmm, strange. Let's look inside the box.zts24537e	(There are four strange weapons in the box.)zts24538e	These are undoubtedly weapons Ain made. I'd better take them back to the town.zts24540e	Here, I've got the stolen weapons.zts24541e	That's lucky! Have you checked the weapons for any damage?zts24542e	They don't look damaged at all. But I'm not sure since I don't know how to use them.zts24543e	I'll check them with this device.zts24544e	(She runs the elongated device over the weapons.)zts24545e	My goodness! Someone's modified the weapons!zts24546e	What exactly is the problem?zts24547e	The magic power in the weapons has been reversed, rendering them useless. I can repair them but it's going to take a while. I don't think I'll manage it before the next attack...zts24548e	Damn it! Can I help in any way?zts24549e	No, I've got to repair the weapons myself. But maybe there's another way you can help me...zts24550e	Did you see who stole the weapons?zts24551e	Yes. They weren't dragons; they were Draconians.zts24552e	Hmm... All Draconians should be in the town, actually. That means we've got traitors in our ranks.zts24553e	Shall I go and search for these rebels in the town?zts24554e	Yes. If they realise their plan to steal the weapons has failed, they might start keeping tabs on me.zts24555e	Then I should stay with you and protect you.zts24556e	Don't worry about me. My lab is protected by a nifty security system. And I've got bodyguards as well. I'd rather you track down the renegades with Captain Enrico.zts24557e	As you wish. I'll find these rebels. Oh, and Ain... Take care!zts24558e	I will. Best of luck!zts24560e	Captain!zts24561e	Oh, hello there, adventurer! Did you get the weapons back?zts24562e	Yes, I did. But the thieves modified the weapons so they no longer work.zts24563e	Oh no. Who were these theives?zts24564e	Draconians. Ain thinks we've got renegades here in the town.zts24565e	The thieves undoubtedly belong to this group. That's what I thought...zts24566e	I'll get my spy to find out as much as possible about the traitors. Maybe you can take care of some other things in the meantime, <pname>.zts24568e	Do you have a job for me?zts24569e	Yes, the rancher needs your help. Go and talk to Emily.zts24571e	Hello Emily.zts24572e	Oh, hello, <pname>. I was just going to send for you.zts24573e	Good timing, hehe. I wanted to ask if I can help you out.zts24574e	That's just as well. Please go to the Dragon Ranch right away, <pname>.zts24575e	Oh, are you having problems?zts24576e	My workers have asked me to send soldiers to the ranch. Something's not right there.zts24577e	Sounds like a job for me. I'm already on my way!zts24578e	Thank you very much. There'll be a reward waiting for you when you get back.zts24580e	Oh no, monsters are attacking the animals on the ranch!zts24581e	I've got to protect the triceratops from the monsters.zts24583e	A few of the farm's buildings have sustained damage but the animals seem to be okay.zts24584e	I'll report to Emily.zts24586e	The problems on the ranch have been dealt with.zts24587e	Thank you! Is the ranch safe now?zts24588e	Yes. It's all just fine, only a few fences need repairing.zts24589e	If that's everything. That can be fixed. Thanks again... Here, a reward for your efforts.zts24590e	You shouldn't have. But of course I'm pleased with the reward.zts24592e	I know why he's calling me. I'll be on my way.zts24594e	Oh, <pname>. At last, you're here.zts24595e	Did your spy find out anything?zts24596e	He discovered a strange place in the town.zts24597e	One of them is definitely the rebel headquarters.zts24598e	I think so, too. My soldiers are already patrolling the outer districts of the town. Could you inspect a few places inside the town in the meantime?zts24599e	Of course. Where should I go?zts24600e	Here. I've marked the locations on your map. Take a look around there.zts24601e	All right, I'm on it.zts24602e	(I'd better take a look at the nearest place first.)zts24604e	What an odd place... But there's nothing to find here.zts24605e	On to the next location!zts24607e	There's nothing here, either.zts24609e	Just a kids' hiding place.zts24611e	Hmm, this is the last place marked on the map.zts24613e	(You quietly open a secret door in the ground...... and see a group of armed Draconians!)zts24614e	(Ha, this is their HQ! I have to tell the captain.)zts24616e	Captain, I've found the rebel headquarters!zts24617e	That's just as well. My agents have found out who this group is.zts24618e	And?zts24619e	They're members of a religious sect known as the Drakov.zts24620e	And what's with these Drakov, exactly?zts24621e	Well, all Draconians have a particularly trusting relationship with dragons. But the Drakov take it one step further: they worship dragons as gods.zts24622e	Before Asgobas attacked, they were quiet and we tolerated them.zts24623e	But during the attacks, they proclaimed that people should accept the punishment of their gods and go joyfully to their deaths.zts24624e	But now they've completely lost it!zts24625e	These fanatics are responsible for the deaths of many a Draconian. After the attack, we defeated their leader, Eugene, in battle and killed him.zts24626e	I see.zts24627e	We suspect that the remaining members are after revenge. We've got to find them and hunt them down before Asgobas attacks again.zts24628e	I agree. I'll march into their headquarters and take care of things.zts24629e	Good, so be it. My best soldiers will go with you.zts24631e	The Drakov are finally history.  I'll report to the captain.zts24632e	Captain, we've captured the Drakov headquarters.zts24634e	Captain, we've captured the Drakov headquarters.zts24635e	Now we don't have to worry about traitors in our midst any more.zts24636e	Excellent! But now the next danger looms...zts24637e	I've just found out that Asgobas' army is gathering.zts24638e	Are they getting ready for another attack?zts24639e	Yes. The council has already gathered to discuss countermeasures.zts24640e	Then let's go!zts24642e	The command staff are assembled. Captain, please summarise the current situation for us briefly.zts24643e	Yes, sir! Asgobas' army is gathering... and both the Ice Dragon and the Zombie Dragon are on their way to join them.zts24644e	How far away from the town is the army?zts24645e	We estimate that the dragons should take about five days to cover the distance.zts24646e	How many soldiers do we have at our disposal?zts24647e	Only 80% of the soldiers are combat-ready following the last attack.zts24648e	The situation is serious. Ain, how are you getting on with the weapons?zts24649e	I'm doing what I can but the broken weapons aren't ready for use yet. I need more time.zts24650e	But we don't have any...zts24651e	Uh, I'd like to ask a question.zts24652e	Be my guest, <pname>.zts24653e	Are the Ice and Zombie dragons as strong as Asgobas?zts24654e	No, they're weaker. But still powerful enough! And they've both got their own armies.zts24655e	They we should attack those armies before they join Asgobas'. It might buy us some time and improve our chances.zts24656e	That's a good idea. But how are we supposed to defeat two dragons and their armies? Do you think you can do it, adventurer?zts24657e	Yes. I'll strike down the Ice and Zombie Dragons myself.zts24658e	You're incredibly brave, adventurer!zts24659e	I'll do my best. Ain, would you help me?zts24660e	Of course! I'll be there with advice and support.zts24661e	I'm afraid I don't know where exactly the dragons are.zts24662e	Hmm, I can modify the tracking device so that you can use it to detect dragons as well.zts24663e	Although I'm going to need some materials for that.zts24664e	No problem, I'll get you what you need.zts24665e	While the adventurer sees to the dragons, we'll get our defences ready, gather supplies for the soldiers and boost our troops' morale.zts24666e	And you keep working on the weapons, Ain.zts24668e	Next I'm going to modify the tracking device so that you can use it to detect the Zombie Dragon.zts24669e	Why should I go for the Zombie Dragon first?zts24670e	Quite simple: because that one's easier to detect.zts24671e	Which is why you should see to the Zombie Dragon first and defeat him as quickly as possible. Then the Ice Dragon will be in for it!zts24672e	That makes sense. Which materials do you need?zts24673e	What do you think is special about the Zombie Dragon, <pname>?zts24674e	Hmm, the his flesh hangs from his bones and he has a beastly stench?zts24675e	That's true, but that alone doesn't make him any different from the other undead.zts24676e	The Zombie Dragon is ancient and really should have turned to dust by now.zts24677e	Incredibly powerful, dark magic keeps him alive... or rather, 'unalive'.zts24678e	And this magic has an effect on any monsters in his vicinity.zts24679e	So there's something I need to take from these monsters, right?zts24680e	That's right. Please get me the monsters' belongings from the dragon graveyard.zts24681e	I'm on it. I'll just follow the stink of dead flesh.zts24683e	Phwoar, that smells really awful! I'll be glad when I've deposited these materials with Ain. *retch*zts24685e	Fantastic! I can use this to improve the device in no time!zts24686e	(Ain gets the materials ready and then integrates them into the tracking device.)zts24687e	Right, done. The device now shows you which direction the dragon is in. And when you get close, it'll show you its location.zts24688e	Wow, that's brilliant! A great piece of kit. Ah, it's already showing me where to go.zts24689e	This is my opus magnum... A masterpiece!zts24690e	Then I'll go and hunt down that Zombie Dragon now.zts24691e	Be careful! Don't underestimate him - he's the oldest dragon in the world.zts24693e	The device is leading me to this cave.zts24694e	Close your eyes and go!zts24696e	Oh no, the poisonous gas in the cave is too strong. I can't go any further.zts24697e	I'll turn around and talk to Ain first.zts24699e	Ain, I need your help.zts24700e	What can I do for you, <pname>?zts24701e	I've found the Zombie Dragon's hideout but I can't go inside because of the poisonous gas.zts24702e	Hmm, you'll need an Anti-Venom Potion.zts24703e	Oh, have you got one of those?zts24704e	I've got potions for fighting the undead, but in order to withstand the Zombie Dragon's poison we're going to need something stronger.zts24705e	Hmm, I can already see where this is going... So... what materials do you need to make an Anti-Venom Potion?zts24706e	I'll give you a list. You should find most of the materials near the Frozen Lake and in the Ice Dungeon.zts24708e	It's freezing cold here. *brrrr* I'm going to go and warm up.zts24710e	I've gathered everything together, Ain.zts24711e	Let's see... Yes, it's all there! I'll make the potion now.zts24712e	(Ain mixes everything together and then puts the materials into a strange machine that chops it all into little pieces.)zts24713e	Right, done. Poison won't be able to touch you with this potion. But it only works for a limited time!zts24714e	Thank you! I'll return when I've defeated the Zombie Dragon!zts24715e	Be careful! It's very strong.zts24717e	Ain, I did it! Not even the most skilled necromancers could bring the Zombie Dragon back to life now.zts24718e	Fantastic! You're a true hero, <pname>.zts24719e	We might have won this battle, but the war still rages on. Next, I'm going to turn up the heat on the Ice Dragon!zts24720e	But we'll need to track him down first.zts24721e	That's why we'll need to recalibrate your tracking device. The principle is the same as last time. Only, we need some strong cold energy this time.zts24722e	So I've got to go back into the cold again, hm? Hopefully I won't get the sniffles...zts24723e	Haha, if that happens, I'll nurse you back to health myself.zts24725e	Here.zts24726e	Great! Now I'm going to set the tracking device so that you can use it to detect the Ice Dragon.zts24727e	(Ain integrates the materials into the device.)zts24728e	Right, done. Now you can go and challenge the Ice Dragon.zts24729e	It works in the same way?zts24730e	Yes, same old.zts24731e	Okay. I'll start searching for the Ice Dragon.zts24733e	The tracking device is showing that the Ice Dragon is somewhere nearby.zts24735e	The Ice Dragon's servants were a challenge in themselves. How strong must the Ice Dragon himself be... Whatever, I MUST defeat him!zts24737e	Ain, I gave the Ice Dragon hell!zts24738e	I'm impressed, <pname>. Now we have a chance against Asgobas' army!zts24739e	Hmm, both dragons were very powerful. If Asgobas is the strongest one, I don't know whether we'll come out of this battle victorious.zts24740e	Don't lose heart. We'll do it together!zts24741e	Thank you, your words give me strength.zts24742e	Come, let's go and see the captain. I'm eager to see what sort of defence the town has got planned.zts24743e	Good idea.zts24745e	Captain, I've defeated both the Ice Dragon and the Zombie Dragon.zts24746e	What?! That's... excellent work, adventurer! You never cease to amaze me, <pname>.zts24747e	Haha, thank you! Now we've got to concentrate on Asgobas' army.zts24748e	According to our scouts, they stopped a little way from the town an hour ago.zts24749e	We need to get ready for their attack.zts24750e	How can I help?zts24751e	There are still a few things to take care of but it shouldn't be a problem for the dragon slayer!zts24752e	We have enough weapons and equipment. Though we're still missing materials for any eventual repairs. Could you go and lend Quarermaster Marto a hand with getting the materials?zts24753e	Consider it done, sir! I'll be back soon.zts24755e	Here are the materials you wanted, Marto.zts24756e	Oh, thank you, <pname>. I might not be fighting at your side, but I'll be supporting our troops.zts24757e	Haha, good man. I'll go and see the captain again now.zts24759e	I've taken everything that's needed to Marto, Captain.zts24760e	Very good. You're okay?zts24761e	Yes I'm fine, thanks for asking.zts24762e	That puts my mind at ease. You are our strongest weapon. We can't let anything happen to you.zts24763e	I've got one last job for you.zts24764e	What is it?zts24765e	You've already helped us get weapons and equipment. But we still don't have enough food.zts24766e	'No bite, no fight' as my soldiers always say.zts24767e	Are there any supplies left at the ranch, maybe?zts24768e	I'm afraid the ranch's storeroom was burned to the ground during the last attack. We'll have to hunt monsters and animals to get food.zts24769e	The meat from many of the monsters and animals around here is very nourishing. Hunt them and take their meat to Emily.zts24770e	Of course, I'm on it!zts24771e	Hey Emily. I heard that food supplies are running low, so I went hunting. Please, take this.zts24772e	Oh! Thank you, <pname>! We can use that to sustain our soldiers.zts24773e	I'll prepare a special dish for the upcoming battle.zts24774e	Oh, I can't wait! If it's really that tasty then we can't lose, hehe.zts24776e	Captain, I've completed this task as well.zts24777e	Excellent work!zts24778e	Is there any news on Asgobas' army?zts24779e	Apparently they're on the move again. So we're running out of time. Can you please ask Ain whether the weapons are now good to go?zts24780e	(I hope Ain manages to repair the weapons in time.)zts24782e	Ain, Asgobas' army is getting closer and closer.zts24783e	Yes, I know... Are you here about the weapons?zts24784e	Yes. Have you repaired them?zts24785e	I'm sorry, but something's not right with the control device calibration. We'll need to build a better device.zts24786e	But with the materials we've got, that won't be possible.zts24787e	That means...zts24788e	I'm sorry, <pname>. I've disappointed you...zts24789e	No, it's not your fault. Maybe we can think of something else. I'll buy you some more time.zts24791e	(The bells in the town ring out suddenly.)zts24792e	Why are the bells ringing?zts24793e	That's the alarm signal. Asgobas' army is at the gates.zts24794e	So today is finally the day...zts24796e	We were able to fend off the attack with great difficulty. As we didn't succeed in bringing Asgobas down, that won't be the last we see of him.zts24797e	I'll have a look around to see how badly the town has been damaged.zts24799e	Captain, are you all right? How's the town?zts24800e	Yes, I'm fine, <pname>. Thanks to your help, we were able to fend off the attack. The damage to the town is severe, however.zts24801e	Half of our soldiers have fallen. And most of our supplies have been destroyed. As for civilians... Many of them have been killed, too.zts24802e	But we're Draconians! We won't let this get us down. What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger!zts24803e	A good attitude, Captain! I hope you're right.zts24804e	Is there anything I can do?zts24805e	Indeed, <pname>. And thank you for your help! Ain was asking for you. Go and see her.zts24806e	I'm already on my way!zts24808e	You wanted to talk to me, Ain?zts24809e	Yes. I now know what we need in order to make the device.zts24810e	Oh, that is good news! What do you need?zts24811e	... Asgobas' Scales.zts24812e	The device I used was too weak for the weapons' magic.zts24813e	But Asgobas' Scales are so hard that even powerful magic barely touches them.zts24814e	The perfect material for the device!zts24815e	So once you have them, you'll be able to have the weapons ready soon?zts24816e	The problem will be getting the scales. I was able to collect a few after the last battle but they're not enough.zts24817e	Would you try to take a few scales the next time you fight Asgobas, <pname>?zts24818e	Sure, no problem! (... If he doesn't tear me to shreds beforehand...)zts24819e	(I should probably stay a while longer. The Draconians need my help.)zts24821e	Thank you for your help. We need diverse materials to produce this machine.zts24822e	What do you need?zts24823e	I'll divide them into two categories. The materials in the first category are the ones I'll need to make the cylinders and a stable frame.zts24824e	The second category of materials is used for making the fuel hoses and the tank.zts24825e	I've already put a list together. Please gather all these materials and bring them to me.zts24826e	Will do! (Oof, that's a long list... I hope I can find all the materials.)zts24828e	Great! Now I need the materials to make the fuel supply. Please bring them to me.zts24830e	Here, Ain. I've gathered all the materials that are on your list.zts24831e	You did it. Thank you!zts24832e	Now I can finish the Magic Mega-Machine. Once it's ready, I'd like to show it to you first, <pname>.zts24833e	I'm already getting excited. What an honour!zts24835e	Thank you for giving up your time, <pname>.zts24836e	My pleasure. And after all, I'll also benefit from this new remedy.zts24837e	Right again.zts24838e	So what do you need?zts24839e	The ingredients we need have a very strong effect, but they're also poisonous.zts24840e	I have developed a method of filtering out the toxins, though.zts24841e	I see.zts24842e	I need the following materials. Please bring them to me.zts24844e	Here. And you can make a strong remedy using these ingredients?zts24845e	Yes. Please wait here. I'll make the remedy now.zts24846e	(The Draconian alchemist proceeds to mix the ingredients together.)zts24847e	(In a strange-looking retort, the mixture turns into a sticky, viscous liquid.)zts24848e	(He finally adds some distilled water and the bluish mixture is ready at last.)zts24849e	Right, done.zts24850e	Do you want to taste the remedy?zts24851e	Uh... maybe not. Besides, I'm not even injured.zts24852e	Oh right, I see...zts24853e	Why don't you just give it to the badly wounded soldiers?zts24854e	Best not, seeing as we haven't tested it at all yet.zts24855e	Hmm, and if we test it on those who... are at death's door?zts24856e	Hmm, a good suggestion. We should present it to the captain.zts24859e	We need your approval, Captain.zts24860e	Oh, hello alchemist. What is it?zts24861e	I've developed a new remedy for the severely wounded.zts24862e	I haven't had a chance to test it yet, though. That's why I wanted to ask if...zts24863e	You want my permission to test it on those who aren't going to make it. Am I right?zts24864e	Yes. If there was any other way...zts24865e	Hmm. Well, there's nothing else we can do for these soldiers. And desperate times call for desperate measures...zts24866e	Permission granted!zts24867e	Thank you, Captain. Would you administer the remedy to the patient, <pname>?zts24868e	I'll do it. Hopefully the treatment will work...zts24870e	This soldier doesn't look too good...zts24871e	He's unconscious. I'll give him the remedy now.zts24872e	(You give the soldier the remedy.)zts24873e	Hmm, no reaction...zts24874e	It'll take a little while for it to kick in.zts24875e	We should check on him later.zts24877e	Captain, how's the patient?zts24878e	Surprisingly, the soldier is doing better.zts24879e	Yahoo! You did it, alchemist!zts24880e	I'm glad that my knowledge and skills are proving useful. What a relief!zts24881e	Thank you for everything. Can you make more of this remedy?zts24882e	You'd just need some more ingredients, right?zts24883e	Indeed. Would you go and sort it out?zts24884e	Of course! I'll bring you the ingredients.zts24886e	Here are the ingredients you need.zts24887e	Thank you! Now we can save even more soldiers.zts24888e	I'll take the remedy to the captain as soon as I've got it ready. Can I call on you again if I need any more ingredients?zts24889e	Of course!zts24890e	Take this remedy as a little reward for your efforts.zts24892e	Thank you! Here's the tracking device.zts24893e	The tracking device is indicating a spot in the dragon graveyard. We can't send our soldiers there, though. It's just too dangerous.zts24894e	You're right. The dragon graveyard is among the most dangerous places in the world.zts24896e	Hmm, they're Draconians. They must be the last of the Drakov. I actually thought we'd defeated them all.zts24897e	Hmm, I should deal with them and retrieve the stolen supplies.zts24899e	I've recovered the stolen supplies, Captain.zts24900e	However, we've got a little problem.zts24901e	Are the Drakov behind this?zts24902e	Yes, that's right.zts24903e	Our spies are reporting that they've appointed a new leader and are now recruiting members again.zts24904e	Who's their new leader?zts24905e	We don't know yet. But we should strike before the sect regroups.zts24906e	I agree. Do you know where their headquarters are?zts24907e	At least we know of one place where the Drakov are gathering. Would you take care of the matter for us?zts24908e	The place is in the dragon graveyard. The Drakov are assembling there.zts24909e	All right. You can rely on me.zts24911e	This is the place the captain said. Then I'll go and look for the Drakov.zts24913e	Phew, there were more than I'd expected. But what are they up to here, anyway?zts24914e	I'd better go back to the town and report to the captain.zts24915e	I've got the Drakov in their hideout, Captain.zts24916e	Great work, <pname>! Unfortunately, we haven't caught the leader yet.zts24917e	Then they'll probably meet again.zts24918e	That's highly likely. We have no other choice but to keep attacking their hideouts until we eventually find their headquarters.zts24919e	Good! That's how it goes... Please let me know when the next attack on the Drakov is going ahead.zts24921e	Uncle Carven, I know how we can heal the girl!zts24922e	I need lots of space for the ritual.zts24923e	Hmm, then I'd better take her outside.zts24924e	(Carven carries the unconscious girl in his arms as he steps out of the house.)zts24925e	Okay, I'll start the ritual now. (So, sprinkle the powder first, then light it... and now for the spell.)zts24926e	Almighty Loa, this girl needs your help.zts24927e	Heal her soul and lead her out of the darkness onto the right path.zts24928e	(Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blows the fire out.)zts24929e	What's going on?zts24930e	I don't know. I did what Pikidir asked of me. Oh, look!zts24931e	(Ain opens her eyes, confused.)zts24933e	Here are the materials you asked for.zts24934e	Great! Thank you!zts24935e	Can you make the new alloy now?zts24936e	Wait a minute, I'll give it a try.zts24937e	(Ain goes into her workshop and a short while later you hear strange machine sounds.)zts24938e	(It then goes quiet again.)zts24939e	(Ain enters the room looking disappointed.)zts24940e	Hmm, you don't look very enthusiastic.zts24941e	Yeah, it was nothing... The heat emanating from Asgobas' Scales was too much for the machine.zts24942e	Damn it! Are the materials still usable?zts24943e	Yes, luckily. Could you ask the Draconian alchemist if he's got any heat-resistant material? It might work with that.zts24944e	Sure, I'm on it.zts24945e	Oh, hello, <pname>. What brings you here?zts24946e	Ain needs some heat-resistant material. Do you have anything like that?zts24947e	I'm afraid not. I've used everything up.zts24948e	Hmm, I can maybe get some new material for you?zts24949e	If you give me some time, I can make it myself.zts24950e	Hmm, unfortunately time is running out.zts24951e	Then I guess you'll have to collect the materials. I'll give you a list. Take the stuff to Ain when you're done. She knows what to do with it.zts24952e	Okay.zts24953e	Did the alchemist have any heat-resistant material, <pname>?zts24954e	I'm afraid he didn't have anything in stock. But he did tell me where I can find the material we need.zts24955e	Anyway. Show me the list.zts24956e	(You show her the list the Draconian alchemist gave you.)zts24957e	Yes, I can make heat-resistant material from that. I'll get everything ready and you go and get the things.zts24958e	Let's do it. I won't be long!zts24959e	Here are the materials you asked for.zts24960e	Great! Wait a minute.zts24961e	(Ain goes into her workshop and a short while later you hear the machine again.)zts24962e	(It goes quiet again after a while.)zts24963e	(Oh no... Has something gone wrong again?)zts24964e	It worked! Finally!zts24965e	Fantastic! What's this mineral called?zts24966e	As I invented it, I deserve the honour of naming it.zts24967e	Oh, cool!zts24968e	And we only managed that thanks to my outstanding intellect and your drive, haha. I name this mineral... Draconium!zts24969e	Draconium... A great name!zts24970e	I'll be able to make new weapons to save our world using this mineral.zts24972e	This is the place the captain described to me. Ah, there's a scout.zts24973e	Hey, are you all right?zts24974e	<pname>! You saved me! Thank you!zts24975e	Do you know where the other soldiers are?zts24976e	I... I'm the only one who survived.zts24977e	Oh... Can you walk?zts24978e	Yes. I must report to the captain urgently.zts24979e	Then we should hurry back to the town.zts24980e	Yes, sir! But there are so many monsters here.zts24981e	Don't worry. I'll get us out of here.zts24982e	I've secured the path. Follow me.zts24983e	I knew you'd manage it, <pname>!zts24984e	Unfortunately I was too late and could only save the one soldier.zts24985e	Don't blame yourself, <pname>. There was nothing more you could do.zts24986e	What do you mean?zts24987e	<pname> had actually already defeated the Ice Dragon Alzanor, but we heard that a giant Ice Dragon was seen in his hideout. So we scouted out the Ice Dragon's hideout and eventually found him. Of course, we fled at once but... I was the only one who got away.zts24988e	My condolences, soldier.zts24989e	This dragon is most definitely the avatar of the Ice Dragon, Alzanor. Which means...zts24990e	... That the dragon's been revived!zts24991e	Some dragons have the power to resurrect themselves. Maybe Asgobas brought him back to life, too. Could you take a look around the dragon's hideout, <pname>?zts24992e	Yes. I'll set off now.zts24993e	There's no doubt that the Ice Dragon Alzanor has risen from the dead.zts24994e	That's not good news. If Alzanor joins Asgobas' army, we're doomed to meet our end.zts24995e	That's probably true. Then I'll just have to kill the Ice Dragon stone cold dead again!zts24996e	The Ice Dragon won't be causing us any more problems now.zts24997e	Excellent work, <pname>! It could be that Asgobas has revived the Ice Dragon again, of course. If that happens, I'll let you know.zts24999e	The captain was right. The number of monsters here really has increased sharply. I'd better deal with them.zts25000e	So, I've thinned out the monsters' ranks.zts25001e	You won't stand in our way! Die, infidel!zts25002e	Wow! What are the Drakov doing here? I'll show them!zts25003e	The Drakov are up to something here. I should report to the captain.zts25004e	Captain, I encountered members of the Drakov in the dragon's lair.zts25005e	Really? What are they doing there?zts25006e	They attacked me when I was fighting the monsters there.zts25007e	Hmm, they must be planning something. I will send my soldiers. They ought to take care of the Drakov. Can you scout out the Zombie Dragon's hideout in the meantime?zts25008e	I'm on it.zts25009e	It looks like the Drakov have resurrected the Zombie Dragon, Valehir.zts25010e	The Zombie Dragon has the power to resurrect himself. But it usually takes much longer. Obviously the Drakov have helped him and accelerated his resurrection.zts25011e	But he's not yet fully recovered. It's best if we strike quickly.zts25012e	I'll just have to break all the Zombie Dragon's rotten bones again!zts25013e	I've defeated the Zombie Dragon again.zts25014e	Excellent work, <pname>! It could be that Asgobas has revived the Zombie Dragon again, of course. If that happens, I'll let you know.zts25015e	Fine, do that.zts25017e	I'm here to help.zts25018e	Oh, <pname>. I've been waiting for you. We breed tame triceratops here.zts25019e	They actually have a gentle temperament, but they're very aggressive at the moment.zts25020e	And once a triceratops flies into a rage, it's impossible to calm it down again.zts25021e	Please defeat the angry triceratops before they can harm the others.zts25022e	I'll take care of it.zts25023e	Phew, that's a lot of angry triceratops. It's no use... Let's go!zts25024e	I've defeated all the angry triceratops. Everything's peaceful again at the Dragon Ranch.zts25025e	Thank you so much. Can I call on you again if the problem comes back?zts25026e	Of course.zts25028e	Pavio, do you need any help?zts25029e	Thank you for coming. We're running out of Dratanium.zts25030e	What's happened?zts25031e	The new shipment was held up in the Gravel Gorge. The monsters there are causing problems. Would you go and sort it out and get rid of the monsters?zts25032e	Sure, that's my speciality!zts25033e	Ugh, there really are tons of monsters here. The wagons would never have made it through.zts25034e	The transport route is safe again, Pavio.zts25035e	Thank you very much. Here's a little something for your efforts.zts25036e	You shouldn't have. Thank you!zts25038e	I've defeated them all.zts25039e	Thank you. Here's your reward.zts25041e	They're safe again now.zts25042e	Thank you! Here is your reward.zts25044e	I've got the materials.zts25045e	Thank you! Here, this is for you.zts25048e	I've trained the recruits.zts25049e	Thank you. Here is your reward.zts25051e	I've defeated the monsters at the Dragon Ranch. It's safe again there now.zts25052e	Thank you so much. Here's a little something for your efforts.zts25053e	To Dragonveil (25,000 Gold)zts25054e	This is the Magic Mega-Machine.zts25055e	Okay, then Ain and <pname> will concentrate on developing new weapons, and the captain will be responsible for defending the town.zts25056e	Oh, I almost forgot. Captain Enrico wants to see you, <pname>.zts25057e	(Phew, I almost became a guinea pig there.) Yes, sir!zts25058e	I am Alesio, President of the Dragon Academy.[n]zts25059e	I'm very busy at the moment. If you don't have anything important to discuss, I'd like to get back to my work.[n]zts25060e	(Hmm, the box looks odd.)zts25061e	Missing Soldierzts25062e	Because of me, my comrades are...zts25063e	You must first defeat the guardians of the cave and capture a special magic crystal to escape from the Ancient Dragon's Lair. Think of it as a kind of test.zts25064e	I'm taking these Dragon Crystals and Dense Dragon's Breath to Ain.zts25066e	This is where the recruits train.zts25067e	Let's get out of this cold!zts25069e	Thank you! Who are you anyway?zts25070e	My name is <pname>. The captain asked me to help with your training.zts25071e	Oh, so you're our new instructor. Always at your service!zts25072e	I hope we get along okay.zts25073e	We'll do our best!zts25075e	Oh, that should do it.zts25076e	Thank you so much. We have learnt a great deal thanks to you.zts25077e	(Oh, I just walloped a couple of monsters. Did they actually learn anything at all?)zts25078e	Glad to hear it. *winks*zts25079e	Would you be able to help with our training again very soon?zts25080e	Of course. But somewhere warmer than here, hehe.zts25082e	There seem to be a few issues at Dragon Ranch.zts25083e	I need to defeat the monsters at Dragon Ranch.zts25085e	Hmm, it sounds like there's fighting nearby. Let's go!zts25087e	This is the Drakov Headquarters.zts25088e	I need to be extremely careful.zts25090e	Why are there dragon eggs here?zts25091e	Are you breeding dragons here, or what? The Drakov are much more dangerous than I thought!zts25093e	You Drakovs, your evil schemes are at an end!zts25094e	I don't believe it.zts25095e	What do you mean?zts25096e	Hah, a foolish upstart! Asgobas will lead the Draconians into a new age.zts25097e	What nonsense! Asgobas brings only death and despair.zts25098e	Well, the weak must be weeded out so that our people can prosper. But Asgobas is bound to explain this to you in person soon.zts25099e	Our people will flourish anew!zts25100e	Shut your mouth!zts25101e	Oh, you halfwit... We'll do Asgobas' job for him and wipe you out right now.zts25102e	(These guys have a screw loose.)zts25103e	(These Drakovs are proper fanatics.)zts25105e	Is this the zombie dragon's lair?zts25106e	Hmm, the air here is filled with poison. I need to be careful.zts25108e	I defeated a huge dragon that looked like Valehir. But since then the toxic fog has only grown more dense.zts25109e	Then I guess it wasn't the real Valehir.zts25110e	The poisonous fog is stopping me from going any further. I'd better return to the city.zts25112e	Is this the ice dragon's lair?zts25113e	This has to be the coldest place in the entire world!zts25115e	I defeated a huge dragon here.zts25116e	It was less powerful than I'd expected.zts25117e	Then I guess it wasn't Alzanor.zts25118e	Alzanor is still holed up somewhere.zts25121e	Aaah... It hurts so bad...zts25122e	Can I help?zts25123e	Would you do me a favour? The New Year Magic White Tiger has stolen the Gift Bags and Lucky Charms I was planning to give to my neighbours.zts25124e	Could you keep a look out for the Stolen Gift Bags and Lucky Charms on your travels?zts25125e	Where will I find the New Year Magic White Tiger?zts25126e	You'll find the New Year Magic White Tiger while hunting monsters within your level range.zts25127e	But you'll have to be quick! Once it sees you, it'll turn tail and run rather than get dragged into a fight with you.zts25128e	If you bring me 5 Stolen Gift Bags and 5 Stolen Lucky Charms, I'll give you a New Year's Gift Box.zts25129e	Portal to the Land of Lifezts25130e	Enter the Land of Life (Champion Level: 30-59)zts25131e	Enter the Advanced Land of Life (Champion Level: 60-80)zts25132e	Check Remaining Land of Life Timezts25133e	Would you like to move to the Land of Life?

Upgrading your cards can give them random bonuses.zts25142e	Please tell me what materials I'll need.zts25143e	Please tell me how I can improve my partner.zts25144e	You need souls, gems, gold and another specialist partner card for the fusion.zts25145e	If you have another copy of the specialist partner card you want to upgrade and use this as the material, your partner will earn even more XP.zts25146e	Upgrading to certain levels even requires that you use a copy of the card you're upgrading, plus a gemstone of the same element.zts25147e	In that case you can't use other specialist partner cards for the upgrade.zts25148e	Remember though, if you use an upgraded specialist card as the material, only some of the experience points will be transferred, so choose wisely.zts25149e	If your specialist partner card increases level, it will gain skill points.zts25150e	When your partner gets skill points, it will also get a bonus at random.zts25151e	But there is also a limit to these bonuses.zts25152e	Once a bonus reaches its cap, it will not be included among the possible bonuses.zts25153e	If your specialist partner card gets two or more skill points at once, each bonus is randomly chosen separately.zts25154e	15th Anniversary Eventzts25155e	NosTale's celebrating its 15th anniversary and it's all thanks to you! *applause*zts25156e	That's why we have the best present ever for our 15th anniversary!zts25157e	If you bring me the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 15, I'll transform them into your gift.zts25158e	Exchange for 15th Anniversary Medalzts25159e	Exchange for 15th Anniversary Buffzts25160e	The 15th Anniversary Medal has many shop item functions.zts25161e	You need all the letters N, O, S, Y, E, A, R plus the number 15. Do you want to exchange them?zts25162e	The 15th Anniversary Buff increases your maximum HP and MP for 3,200 seconds.zts25163e	You need the letters Y, E, A, R plus the number 15. Do you want to receive the buff?zts25164e	Draconium Weapons (10th Specialist Quest)zts25165e	Soul Blessingzts25166e	<pname>, could you do me a favour?zts25167e	I have almost finished developing the new weapons for the fight against Asgobas. Unfortunately, there's a problem.zts25168e	What's the problem?zts25169e	The weapons' core material, Draconium, is a very lightweight but powerful material that contains dragon magic.zts25170e	However it does have one decisive weakness.zts25171e	The dragon magic is simply too strong! The bodies of the bearers of these weapons cannot withstand the energy. Many suffered severe physical harm, and some even died...zts25172e	Oh, well that's a problem indeed. What can we do about it?zts25173e	I've developed a new device to help counteract this effect. Although I'm going to need some special materials to make it.zts25174e	Ah, I see. Just tell me what you need.zts25175e	Sorry, I'm busy.zts25176e	(Apparently I cannot use the weapon properly due to the disharmony with the contender's soul. There's got to be a solution to this problem!)zts25177e	I should ask Ain how I can upgrade the specialist card that contains a piece of the contender's soul.zts25179e	Is there anywhere to train here?zts25180e	Yes. But where are the contenders? They supposedly arrived a while ago.zts25181e	Maybe they have already started training. Look, there are a lot of slain monsters over there.zts25182e	All right, I'll have a look.zts25184e	It sounds like there's fighting nearby.zts25185e	Look, <pname>. The contenders are fighting against monsters.zts25186e	Let's go help them.zts25188e	All enemies have been defeated.zts25189e	Haha, <pname> was there at the right moment! That could have ended badly.zts25190e	What happened here?zts25191e	The boy just started shooting willy-nilly. I was scared to death!zts25192e	That wasn't my fault. She was the one who charged at the enemies!zts25193e	Excuse me? I protected you and fought off the attacks! What exactly did I do wrong?zts25194e	My weapon is bloody powerful. That is why you should have attacked only after I thinned out the enemy's ranks.zts25195e	Nonsense! You could have shot at the enemies that I wasn't attacking.zts25196e	Now calm down for a second.zts25197e	Don't get involved! You hitting the monsters with your heavy robot arms didn't make the fight any easier.zts25198e	Only because you made the whole ground shake!zts25199e	You're really clueless...zts25200e	Calm down already!zts25201e	It's only natural we're not yet used to each other. After all we've never fought together before. We need to improve on our teamwork.zts25202e	Good point. We need to train more.zts25203e	Good, let's continue then.zts25205e	(The adventurer and the contenders step - without them noticing - into a strange magic circle.)zts25206e	(Suddenly they are forcibly teleported to an unknown place.)zts25207e	Where are we? Is everyone all right?zts25208e	I'm fine. But... where are the others?zts25209e	I can't see them. What happened? Is that part of the training?zts25210e	I don't think so.zts25211e	Surely it has something to do with this magic circle.zts25212e	Magic circle?zts25213e	Yes, I noticed it just before we landed here.zts25214e	That's impossible! I'm sure the Drakovs have a hand in it.zts25215e	Probably. I guess the aim was to separate us from the contenders.zts25216e	I'm afraid the contenders are in danger.zts25217e	We need to find them as soon as possible. Hurry!zts25219e	Where are the contenders?zts25220e	Wait a minute... Did you hear that?zts25221e	Yes. An explosion. That sounded like a cannon.zts25222e	I think so too. The contenders must be around here somewhere.zts25223e	Come on, let's go!zts25225e	You've already taken out a lot of enemies, but that's still too many.zts25226e	<pname>, just the two of us are left. The others are too badly injured.zts25227e	We should get out of here and take the wounded contenders to safety.zts25228e	Without question! But how are we going to do that?zts25229e	Hey, boss! There's a problem. We can't summon Valehir's Avatar because the summoners are too exhausted.zts25230e	There are only two enemies left. But they're wiping the floor with us! Retreat!zts25231e	Ha, they're retreating! This is our chance.zts25232e	Yes, <pname>. I will try to open a portal that will take us away from here.zts25233e	Done! Come on, let's get the wounded to safety.zts25234e	I'll take care of it. The contenders need urgent medical attention.zts25236e	The contenders are probably in that cave.zts25237e	We're here to support you, <pname>. Just tell us what to do.zts25238e	I will go into the cave. You'll guard the entrance and watch out for enemies.zts25239e	Yes, sir! Please save the contenders, <pname>.zts25241e	This is the last room. Still no sign of the contenders.zts25242e	(There are two big boxes by the opponents.)zts25243e	Maybe the contenders are in those boxes. Come on, let's take a look.zts25244e	Intruders!zts25245e	Guard the boxes! Crush these intruders!zts25246e	I guess we have to take care of the opponents first.zts25248e	(There is a moan from the box.)zts25249e	I'm certain the contenders are in these boxes.zts25250e	(You break open the boxes. Inside, bound and gagged, are Shania and Gail.)zts25251e	Are you all right? Can you walk?zts25252e	My legs are hurt. But it should be fine.zts25253e	I'm fine as well.zts25254e	Follow me. We have to get out of here quickly.zts25256e	Here are the materials you asked for.zts25257e	Thanks, <pname>. Now I can finish the device. Please wait here.zts25259e	Finally! The weapons are finished, <pname>.zts25260e	Ah, so you were finally able to finish the weapons for the fight against Asgobas.zts25261e	Yes. My brother had passed these blueprints on to me, but they required lots of very rare materials and the process turned out to be very elaborate. That's why I could only make one weapon of each kind.zts25262e	Can you explain to me how the weapons work?zts25263e	In total, I managed to make four different weapons:The first weapon is a lance that can even penetrate dragon scales. To go with it, I made a shield that can't be harmed by magic and can even withstand dragon's breath. The second weapon is a blaster which lets you launch various grenades and take down even the toughest enemies.The third weapon is the so-called Gravitational Sphere, which can be used to influence gravity.And last but not least, I created robotic arms, the Draconium Gloves. They are powered by a magical engine that gives them their destructive power.zts25264e	That sounds fantastic! And everyone can use these weapons?zts25265e	No, normal soldiers can't handle them. Every hero who was able to wield one fell during Asgobas' first attack on our city. That was also when the original weapons were lost.zts25266e	That's why I looked around for suitable contenders and adapted these new weapons especially for them.zts25267e	That makes sense. So all we have to do is give the weapons to these contenders?zts25268e	No, they're not ready yet. We must be really sure that these contenders are truly worthy to carry these weapons.zts25269e	I will have a look at them and see what they are made of. Will you accompany me?zts25270e	Of course! I'd like to know how the weapons work and what they can do.zts25271e	Well, let's have a look at the Dragonlance contender first.zts25272e	And where do we find her?zts25273e	We'll meet her on the way to the Dragon Ranch. She and I are good friends. Let's go.zts25275e	Is this the contender for the Dragonlance?zts25276e	Yes. She is the strongest and most loyal shepherdess here. Her name is Shania.zts25277e	Hello, Shania! How are you?zts25278e	Hello, Ain! Great to see you. Are you here to get your milk?zts25279e	And who is your companion? Oh, you're <pname>, the famous adventurer, aren't you? Pleased to meet you. I've heard much about you! Especially about your great strength.zts25280e	Haha, you're too kind!zts25281e	Today I am concerned with something more important than milk, Shania.zts25282e	Ah, I can guess why you're here. You finally finished the weapon, right?zts25283e	That's right. Are you ready?zts25284e	I can't wait to try out the weapon, but first I have to do my chores here. Can you wait a little longer?zts25285e	Of course. So? What do you think of Shania, <pname>?zts25286e	In any case I would rather help her than just sit around and wait. Can I lend you a hand?zts25287e	Of course, thanks! There's always a lot to do on a ranch, <pname>.zts25288e	Wonderful. What do you want me to do?zts25289e	You really mean it? I'm glad.zts25290e	First you'll have to defeat the dangerous monsters on the ranch. Afterwards, please bring me the milk and meat stolen by the gremlins.zts25291e	Nothing easier than that! Wait here, I'll be back soon.zts25293e	I've defeated all the monsters. Now I'll get you the stolen food.zts25295e	(Right, done. Let's go to Shania!)zts25297e	I have completed all the tasks. Are you ready now?zts25298e	Yes, I have also just finished my work. Good timing!zts25299e	Excellent! Then we can test the weapon now.zts25300e	(Ain opens a large chest. In it are a radiant white lance, a shield and armour.)zts25301e	Wow! This is truly the perfect equipment to bring down a dragon.zts25302e	This lance looks quite heavy. How do you fight with it?zts25303e	For ordinary mortals, it's impossible. But I believe Shania has what it takes.zts25304e	Haha, you're making me blush.zts25305e	(You eye Shania sceptically.) Are you sure you know how to use the weapon?zts25306e	I may not be as powerful as you, <pname>, but you shouldn't underestimate me. The work here on the ranch is hard. That's why you need to be physically fit.zts25307e	But I understand if you don't believe me. That's why I'm going to prove it to you.zts25308e	(Shania quickly grabs the lance and lifts it effortlessly with one hand.)zts25309e	W... Wow! That's...zts25310e	(Shania thrusts the lance into a large rock... leaving a gaping hole in the stone!)zts25311e	Well, do you believe me now?zts25312e	Su... Sure!zts25313e	I knew you would! But brute force alone is not enough. You should train with <pname>, Shania. In this way, I can collect data which will help me to further improve the weapon.zts25314e	I can start right away. You ready, <pname>?zts25315e	Absolutely! Where shall we train?zts25316e	I know just the place. Come on!zts25318e	You're really strong! If I wasn't so experienced, I would have lost.zts25319e	And I realised that strength alone is not enough to wield such a weapon. Practice is the key. Ain, were you able to collect useful data during our practice fight?zts25320e	Yes. It was really enlightening. I can improve the weapon with just a few twists and turns. Thank you for everything. I'll be back once I've done everything.zts25321e	Okay. I'm looking forward to it. See you!zts25322e	With which weapon do we continue?zts25323e	Next up: the blaster weapon. However, there is a problem with the contender.zts25324e	A few days ago we lost contact with him. The captain has already started a search, but so far it has been unsuccessful.zts25325e	Hm, then we should have a chat with the captain.zts25327e	Hello Captain.zts25328e	I was just about to send a soldier to give you the bad news.zts25329e	Oh dear... Is it about the contender?zts25330e	Sadly, yes. We've discovered his body in the Gravel Gorge. His arms and legs were tied. Someone murdered him.zts25331e	I can only think of one group that would be capable of such heinous deeds.zts25332e	I can imagine whom you mean, <pname>. And I agree.zts25333e	It must have been the Drakovs. I hate these guys!zts25334e	I think so too. We looked for their hideout, but had no luck. They use magic to hide the place.zts25335e	What do we do now? After all, we need a contender to wield the weapon.zts25336e	Since the weapon no longer has a bearer, I volunteer.zts25337e	Who's that?zts25338e	You again... This is Gail, an orphan boy who lost his family during the first invasion. Don't listen to him, the boy has no idea!zts25339e	Your name is Gail? And you want to wield this weapon?zts25340e	That's right. And I'm not a little child anymore. Stop treating me like one!zts25341e	Excuse me. But I cannot give you this weapon. It is far too heavy for you and not easy to use.zts25342e	But... I want to avenge my family and wipe out these terrible monsters!zts25343e	Is there another contender for the weapon?zts25344e	No. We have to find a new one. Wait a minute... You don't want to give the weapon to that child, do you?zts25345e	Of course such a decision must be well considered. It would take a lot of time to look for a new contender. But if the boy does well with this weapon, we might as well consider making *him* a contender. What do you think about that?zts25346e	I agree with you. However, the blaster weapon and its bearer should have a natural magical connection. And of course, the contender must also have the appropriate strength to wield the weapon.zts25347e	Can you check if Gail and the blaster have such a connection?zts25348e	Yes. I will scan his body.zts25349e	(Ain pulls a strange device out of his pocket and scans Gail from top to bottom.)zts25350e	Surprisingly, the device shows a strong connection. Most interesting.zts25351e	So I get to wield the blaster?zts25352e	Yes, but only on loan. If you prove yourself worthy and show that you can handle the weapon before we find another contender, it is yours.zts25353e	Great! I won't disappoint you!zts25354e	<pname>, do you really believe this boy is the one?zts25355e	He seems a little lanky, but his will is strong.zts25356e	Hm, alright then. But we should keep an eye on him.zts25357e	Of course. He also has to get used to the gun. In the meantime, we move on to the next weapon, the Draconium Gloves.zts25358e	Okay. (I'm curious to see who the next contender is.)zts25360e	Hm, isn't that your lab?zts25361e	Indeed it is. The next contender is in the laboratory.zts25362e	Wow! Is it one of your assistants?zts25363e	When you see him, you will know why I chose him. Come in.zts25364e	(The lab is in utter chaos.)zts25365e	A man with a wild mane is wielding robotic arms in a completely full room).zts25366e	Ah, Doctor Ain. I've been waiting for you. I need to show you something.zts25367e	(Hm, the guy doesn't look particularly strong. And he's supposed to use these heavy, unwieldy gloves?)zts25368e	Hello! Nice robotic arms.zts25369e	Uh... uhm... <pname>, what a surprise! Thanks for the compliment...zts25370e	Hello, Doctor Aldo.zts25371e	(He seems very introverted. My presence seems to make him nervous.)zts25372e	Sorry for disturbing. Shall I wait outside?zts25373e	No, Doctor Aldo is just a bit shy. He doesn't mean anything by it. Besides, I value your opinion very much, <pname>.zts25374e	That's right. I'm sorry, <pname>.zts25375e	No problem, I understand that. Does Aldo want to wear these gloves after helping you to rebuild them?zts25376e	Indeed he did. I am not familiar with these weapons, so Doctor Aldo's expertise is invaluable.zts25377e	You know martial arts, Doctor Aldo? That surprises me.zts25378e	Haha, only in theory. I have read many books about it.zts25379e	We Draconians are not particularly suited as martial artists, to be honest. But Aldo has really devoured all the books on the subject. I am convinced that he is the right one.zts25380e	Aldo, have you finished the Draconium Gloves?zts25381e	I thought I only had to recalibrate the stabilisers. But then another issue arose.zts25382e	What issue?zts25383e	As you know, the gloves are powered by magical energy. It is the fuel, so to speak. This allows them to unleash their incredible power. However, the fuel pipes cannot withstand this enormous force. We need different materials.zts25384e	Hm, what would be suitable for that... We are running out of time. We need to find out as soon as possible which materials are suitable for new fuel pipes.zts25385e	We'll discuss this briefly in private, <pname>.zts25386e	All right, go ahead.zts25387e	(Ain and Aldo put their heads together and discuss.)zts25388e	(Woah, there are a lot of books in this lab).zts25389e	(You look around at the bookshelves. Then you pull out a book and start reading.)zts25390e	('Destructive Martial Arts - by Doctor Aldo'. Aldo wrote this? I'll have to take a closer look.)zts25391e	(The book contains detailed descriptions and illustrations, all made by Aldo.)zts25392e	He really understood the martial arts at their core. No doubt about it, he's the one.zts25393e	(Suddenly Ain shouts enthusiastically.)zts25394e	Great! That's done. Surely <pname> will help us.zts25395e	(It seems the two have finally found the solution.)zts25396e	We now know which materials are needed to reinforce the fuel pipes. Would you help us and get the appropriate materials?zts25397e	Of course. I'll be back soon.zts25399e	I've got all the materials. Let's head to Ain!zts25401e	Here are the materials you asked for.zts25402e	Thank you! Wait a minute.zts25403e	Is it going to be quick to install the new fuel pipes?zts25404e	No, it will take a while.zts25405e	I see. In the meantime, shall we look at the last contender?zts25406e	That is not necessary.zts25407e	Why? Haven't you found a suitable contender yet? Or is the final weapon not yet finished?zts25408e	No, it's just that...zts25409e	Spit it out!zts25410e	The last contender... is me.zts25411e	The last weapon I made for myself.zts25412e	After all, it is my fault that Asgobas haunts us. I want to fix this.zts25413e	Every night I see the faces of those who lost their lives because of me. Including my dear brother Kai...zts25414e	It is my duty to see his work through to the end. That is why I will wield the last weapon.zts25415e	Well, I can understand that.zts25416e	Besides, the weapon is complicated to use, as you have to use an incredible amount of dragon power very precisely to manipulate gravity. That is not without danger.zts25417e	It is my responsibility to bear this risk.zts25418e	Fine. Is the weapon ready yet?zts25419e	Yes. It was the first weapon I finished. I have been training with it for a long time.  However, I haven't quite mastered it yet.zts25420e	What's the saying? Practice makes perfect, right?zts25421e	You're right. That is why I would like to ask for your help once again.zts25422e	I can already guess what it's about. You want me to train with you, right?zts25423e	Okay. Let's go and find a nice spot. I like to have peace and quiet when I train.zts25424e	That's exactly what I was about to ask you! You can read minds.zts25426e	As expected, I lost against <pname>.zts25427e	But it was close. This new weapon is really amazing.zts25428e	Ah, <pname> and Ain. Here you are.zts25429e	The Captain wants you to go to him immediately. It's very urgent.zts25430e	Hmm, I'm curious to see what's going on there. Let's go!zts25432e	Captain, what's wrong?zts25433e	I'm afraid I have some bad news... The contenders Shania and Gail have been missing since this morning.zts25434e	Oh dear, that's not good at all.zts25435e	Fortunately, we were able to catch one of the kidnappers.zts25436e	He provided us with some information.zts25437e	Did he say where they took them?zts25438e	Yes. He was scared to death and very cooperative.zts25439e	According to him, the remaining Drakovs and the two contenders are in the secret headquarters in the Dragon's Lair.zts25440e	So what are we waiting for? Let's go save them!zts25441e	I have already sent soldiers, but they were stopped by the Drakovs and their monsters.zts25442e	While our enemies are distracted by the soldiers, could you infiltrate the Drakov headquarters and rescue them before they are transferred? What do you say, <pname>?zts25443e	Of course I'll do it. I'll bring them back safe and sound.zts25444e	I'll go with you. My new weapon will come in handy, <pname>.zts25445e	The Drakovs seem to be targeting contenders. So I don't think it's a good idea.zts25446e	Aldo and you better stay here. Safe.zts25447e	I agree with you there. I'm sure <pname> can do it alone.zts25449e	I'm almost at headquarters. First off I should take care of the Drakovs in the area.zts25451e	Right, I've defeated all the enemies. Now I'll rescue the contenders.zts25453e	That's a relief! Follow me. We should get out of here.zts25455e	Captain, I have rescued the two contenders.zts25456e	Excellent work, <pname>! That's great news. Shania, Gail, are you all right?zts25457e	Thanks to <pname> I'm unharmed.zts25458e	I'm fine as well.zts25459e	Very good.zts25460e	Captain, the battle is not won yet. There are still Drakovs who make life difficult for us.zts25461e	Don't worry about that. Our brave soldiers will put an end to this plague once and for all. Leave it to us.zts25462e	Okay. How are Ain and Aldo doing?zts25463e	They are safe. Ah, here comes Ain.zts25464e	<pname>, you're back! I've been waiting for you.zts25465e	Great to see you. Any news?zts25466e	The Draconium Gloves are finally finished. Would you like to see them?zts25467e	With pleasure! Let's go to the lab!zts25469e	I understand you have completed the Draconium Gloves.zts25470e	Yes, <pname>. I finally succeeded.zts25471e	Thanks to Aldo's tireless efforts, the fuel pipes are now working properly.zts25472e	Yes, the material makes it more resistant and at the same time flexible enough to conduct the energy. And we only have Ain to thank for that.zts25473e	Are you going to show me what these gloves can do or keep complimenting each other?zts25474e	Of course, we'll show you. I have an idea... You probably already guessed it, <pname>... Would you like to have a little practice fight against me to put the gloves through their paces? Of course you don't have to if you don't want to.zts25475e	Sure! I'm really curious to see how powerful these things are. Let's try it out!zts25477e	Wow, these gloves are really powerful. An excellent weapon.zts25478e	Yes, our magnum opus, definitely.zts25479e	You're really strong, <pname>. I'm happy that I was able to apply my theoretical knowledge of martial arts in practice. Maybe one day we will have the opportunity for a rematch.zts25480e	That would be great. The fight was really fun.zts25481e	(Suddenly someone comes running.)zts25482e	Oh, someone's coming.zts25483e	Oh, no. Don't tell me the contenders have been kidnapped again.zts25484e	Haha, no, don't worry. I'm only bringing a letter, from a boy in the gorge.zts25485e	What boy?zts25486e	He must mean Gail.zts25487e	Thank you.zts25488e	My pleasure. Have a nice day!zts25489e	Let's see what he wrote then.zts25490e	(You read aloud.)zts25491e	'Hello, <pname> and Ain! How are you all?zts25492e	Firstly, I'd like to thank <pname>. During my rescue, everything happened so quickly that I didn't have the chance.zts25493e	By the way, I have completed my training with the blaster.zts25494e	Now I'd like to show you what I've learned. Let me prove to <pname> and Ain that I'm the rightful bearer of this weapon.zts25495e	I have marked my whereabouts on the map. See you soon!'zts25496e	I knew he would make it.zts25497e	Unbelievable. And in such a short time!zts25498e	Come on, let's see what he's learned.zts25499e	He has found himself a rather dangerous place to train. A really brave boy.zts25500e	Indeed it is. I'm curious to see this cannon's firepower.zts25502e	The firepower of this cannon is insane! This place looks like a battlefield!zts25503e	Of course it does! As expected, the blaster is the most devastating firearm I have ever made.zts25504e	Gail, you're a natural. I didn't think you were a match for the power of the blaster. I also like how well you're doing with the energy expander.zts25505e	Yes, it caused me a lot of problems at the beginning. But I trained hard in dangerous places and eventually I got the hang of it. So, did I pass your test?zts25506e	With flying colours! It's like this blaster was made just for you. I can't even imagine anyone else wielding the blaster anymore.zts25507e	Phew, that's a big weight off my chest! Let's go back to the village.zts25509e	Here we are.zts25510e	I already feel really at home here. So, we have met all the contenders. What do we do now?zts25511e	This is the beginning. The contenders should continue to train and prepare for the fight against Asgobas.zts25512e	Hmm, that makes sense.zts25513e	Please go to the Captain and find out if the training ground is ready.zts25514e	Yes, ma'am! I'll set off now.zts25515e	I'll come with you.zts25517e	Hello Captain. How are you?zts25518e	I've been expecting you. The training ground is now ready.zts25519e	Very good. Then we can train there with the contenders.zts25520e	But be careful. When we tried to smoke out the Drakovs the other day, some of their commanders managed to escape. We fear that they will attack at the training ground.zts25521e	I would advise you not to begin your training until my soldiers have secured the area.zts25522e	We can't wait that long. The contenders must start training immediately. The longer we wait, the more people are killed by Asgobas and his army.zts25523e	I don't see it that way. The safety of the contenders has the highest priority. If we lose them, all hope is gone.zts25524e	I'll have to disagree with you there. My task and that of the contenders is to destroy Asgobas. If the Drakovs attack the training ground, we will finish them off. Should we not succeed, we wouldn't stand a chance against Asgobas anyway.zts25525e	If the Drakovs venture here, it will be good practice for us.zts25526e	Hm... You've convinced me, <pname>.zts25527e	Okay. I trust you, <pname>. But be careful. The Drakovs should not be underestimated.zts25528e	No need to worry about that.zts25529e	Then go on to the training ground. I'll get the contenders.zts25530e	Thank you, Captain, and also to you, <pname>.zts25532e	Just because I insisted, three contenders are now...zts25533e	It's not your fault. I was also responsible and should have taken better care of them.zts25534e	Now the wounded should be cared for.zts25535e	Yes. You're right. Let's talk to the Captain.zts25537e	Captain, I'm sorry. Because of me...zts25538e	Calm down! I already know. Oh, this doesn't look good. Medics! Take care of the wounded! Quick!zts25539e	So, what happened exactly?zts25540e	As expected, the Drakovs attacked us.zts25541e	Their army was huge and they even had Valehir's Avatar in their ranks. We couldn't protect everyone... I am sorry.zts25542e	A whole army? Even I did not expect that. Even with the best preparation, you wouldn't have stood a chance against such an attack. So you are not to blame.zts25543e	We now have to think about how to proceed. How bad are the wounds? Can the contenders still wield their weapons once they are back on their feet? Or do we have to look for new contenders?zts25544e	The weapons are tailored to the contenders. We should focus on providing them with the best possible care so that they are quickly back on their feet.zts25545e	The problem is that they were exposed to the powerful dark magic of Valehir's avatar. It will take a while for them to fully recover.zts25546e	I can see that. It only worries me that we cannot use these weapons until the contenders are ready to fight again.zts25547e	Is there perhaps a way for others to wield these weapons?zts25548e	Hmm... Let me think...zts25549e	In the past, many heroes have passed over their souls to me, letting me acquire their special powers. They are stored in these 'specialist cards'.zts25550e	Hmm, very interesting. Well, the magic power originates in the soul, that's true. If we could find a way to extract a piece of their soul, maybe we could use it to create new specialist cards.zts25551e	Okay. Then we just have to figure out how to channel the souls into cards without harming anyone.zts25552e	Yes, I'll take care of that. I will research a method in my lab. I have all the relevant books there.zts25553e	All right. I'm coming with you, Ain.zts25554e	Please wait, <pname>. I have an important task for you.zts25555e	I fear that the successful attack may give the Drakovs a boost. They may even be making plans to attack our city. We have to beat them to it. Would you take care of it and destroy the remaining Drakovs once and for all?zts25556e	You can find them in the Gravel Gorge and in the Dragon's Lair. Please put an end to this.zts25557e	Of course! I will make them pay for their deeds.zts25558e	And I'll take care of the other problem in the meantime. Please come to my lab when you have completed your mission.zts25559e	I will. As soon as everything is done.zts25561e	Okay, I've got rid of loads of Drakovs. That should be enough. I'd better go back to the town and report to the captain.zts25563e	Hey, Captain! I have struck down a large number of Drakovs. The guys have thoroughly lost the desire to invade.zts25564e	Great work! Thanks to you we gained valuable time.zts25565e	I'm going to Ain's lab now.zts25566e	Go ahead. I hope Ain will find a solution to our problem.zts25568e	Ain, have you been successful?zts25569e	Fortunately, I discovered an ancient tome on soul research. And I found the solution to our problem.zts25570e	The magic that is inherent in us is linked to the soul. And every soul has its very own magical power. If we succeed in extracting only a small piece of the soul, the affected person will not come to any harm in the process.zts25571e	And then we can put this extract into the specialist card.  When you then transform with the weapon in your hand, it gives you all the traits of the contender and you can wield the weapon.zts25572e	The extraction process is of course far more complicated, but I'll spare you the details. Anyway, I have an idea for a device that could be used to extract the power. However, I'll need certain materials for its production.zts25573e	Could you get me those materials, <pname>?zts25574e	Yes. I'll take care of it.zts25576e	Here you go, Ain.zts25577e	Thank you. Now I can finish the device and add the extracted soul pieces of the contenders to the specialist cards. Come back when I'm done with it.zts25579e	Ain, are you ready?zts25580e	Yes. I did it. Here are the weapons.zts25581e	Oh...? This is the Gravitational Sphere. Why are you giving me your weapon?zts25582e	I've realised that I am not strong enough to fight Asgobas and his hordes. Besides, I still feel guilty because the contenders were wounded because of me.zts25583e	That is why I would rather devote myself entirely to caring for the wounded. I am convinced that the weapon is better off in your hands. Will you take it?zts25584e	I thought we would fight side by side...zts25585e	But of course I accept your decision. Let me take care of your weapon. You focus on the wounded.zts25587e	Hello, Ain. How are the contenders doing?zts25588e	Hello <pname>. They are not yet conscious, but their condition has improved.zts25589e	That's a relief. By the way... I need your help.zts25590e	What can I do for you?zts25591e	I know I can use the contenders' weapons when I transform. But I'm having some difficulty wielding the weapons. I simply cannot control their power.zts25592e	Perhaps the soul piece has been weakened over time. Can I see the specialist card?zts25593e	Here you are.zts25594e	(You give Ain the specialist card with the contender's soul.)zts25595e	(Ain checks the card with a special device.)zts25596e	Hmm. The soul has indeed become weaker. But that shouldn't be a problem if I get materials for the upgrade.zts25597e	Can you use these gems to upgrade the card?zts25598e	Gems? Show me.zts25599e	Just a moment.zts25601e	(You give Ain an Orc Soulstone.)zts25602e	This gemstone appears to be damaged but contains a strong soul.zts25603e	Yes. It contains the soul of a legendary Orc Hero. Can you use the stone?zts25604e	We may only extract the magic of the Orc soul from the stone. Otherwise the two souls negate each other in the card.zts25605e	Oh, then you can't use the gemstone?zts25606e	Only if we somehow manage to get the card with the contender's soul to accept the magical energy from the gemstone.zts25607e	Is that possible?zts25608e	I think so, yes. But I need some materials for that.zts25609e	No problem! Just tell me what you need. Ich werde dir alles besorgen.zts25611e	I have all the materials you asked for.zts25612e	Thank you. Give me the materials and then put the card on the machine.zts25613e	(You place the card on the device.)zts25614e	(Ain pushes some buttons. A mysterious sphere forms around the card.)zts25615e	Done! Now you can upgrade the card with the Orc Soulstone.zts25616e	Thank you. Now I can get even stronger!zts25617e	Shepherdess Shaniazts25618e	My name is Shania. I work with my twin sister Emily at the Dragon Ranch.zts25619e	I used to be a soldier, but now I help my sister.zts25620e	Ah, I'm so glad you're doing well. What brings you here?zts25622e	Would you do me a favour? The New Year Rabbit has stolen the Gift Bags and Lucky Charms I was planning to give to my neighbours.zts25623e	Could you keep a look out for the Stolen Gift Bags and Lucky Charms on your travels?zts25624e	Where can I find the New Year Rabbit?zts25625e	You'll find the New Year Rabbit while hunting monsters within your level range.zts25626e	But you'll have to be quick! Once it sees you, it'll turn tail and run rather than get dragged into a fight with you.zts25627e	If you bring me 5 Stolen Gift Bags and 5 Stolen Lucky Charms, I'll give you a New Year's Gift Box.zts25628e	Pet Trainer Lucyzts25629e	A Curious Rabbit (Pet Trainer Specialist Quest)zts25630e	Pet Trainer Side Questszts25631e	What Do Pet Trainers Do?zts25632e	Pet Trainer Shopzts25633e	(Hmm... a rabbit dressed like a ringmaster? Curious... I wonder what her name is...?)zts25634e	(I can hardly wait to talk to that bunny.)zts25635e	Hey, are you new around here? I don't think I've ever seen you before.zts25636e	Why hello! I'm Lucy, I travel around a lot.zts25637e	Oh, and what brings you here? (Accept)zts25638e	Ah, sorry... things to do, people to see! Bye for now! (Decline)zts25642e	Fish Fillet Supplieszts25643e	Practice Makes Perfectzts25644e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expertzts25645e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expert 2zts25646e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expert 3zts25647e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expert 4zts25648e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expert 5zts25649e	The Long Path to Becoming an Expert 6zts25650e	A Pet Trainer tames and trains specific animals and monsters.zts25651e	How to Tame Animalszts25652e	Training Levelzts25653e	Evolutionzts25657e	Give her the pet essence. (Accept)zts25658e	I don't have anything on me. (Decline)zts25665e	<pname>, can you bring me some Fish Fillets?zts25666e	I need to prepare some Bait for taming animals, but I don't have the ingredients I need.zts25667e	<pname>, taming animals looks easy, but there's a lot of practice involved before you can become a decent Pet Trainer.zts25668e	Why don't you try taming an animal every day?zts25670e	Sounds good, more practice can't hurt. (Accept)zts25671e	Sorry, but I have better things to do. (Decline)zts25672e	Animals that you can tame are marked with 1 to 6 stars. The more stars an animal has, the more valuable it is.zts25673e	Pet Trainers have two skills they can use to catch animals: Tame and Advanced Tame. Both skills need a particular item for you to use them: Bait.zts25674e	I can make it for you if you bring me the ingredients.zts25675e	With the Tame skill, you can capture 1-star pets, while Advanced Tame can capture 2-star pets.zts25676e	However, there are a couple of prerequisites. First, you must have a higher level than the animal you want to tame, and second, the target must have less than 50% HP.zts25677e	You can find the training level in your pet's info window.zts25678e	You can summon a Sparring Monster which will attack the animal so it earns experience. Once an animal has acquired enough training experience, it's training level increases.zts25679e	You need a Sparring Monster Cage to summon a Sparring Monster. You can buy those cages from me.zts25680e	When a pet's training level increases, its HP, attack power and defence increase as well. Plus at certain levels it can learn special skills.zts25681e	A pet can have a maximum of two skills, while any skills it has already learned can be upgraded at random.zts25682e	Pets either learn a new skill or upgrade an existing one after reaching the training levels 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60.zts25683e	When a pet reaches the maximum training level, you can increase its star rating with the Evolve skill.zts25684e	Pets can have 1 to 6 stars.zts25685e	You need an essence with the same star rating as the pet you want to upgrade. For example, if you want to upgrade a 2-star pet, you'll need Pet Essence (2 Star).zts25686e	When you increase a pet's star rating, it will forget all of its skills and the training level will be reset to 0, but at the same time its maximum training level and stats multiplier will be increased.zts25687e	Pet Trainer Quest 1zts25688e	Do you really want to hear my story? How nice!zts25689e	(Oh dear, what have I gotten myself in for now...?)zts25690e	I travel around the world, looking for animals and monsters to tame.zts25691e	Then I train them up and have them perform in my circus.zts25692e	Ah, that makes sense. Hmm... but you don't seem to have many animals in your circus.zts25693e	Haha, you're not wrong. But there's a reason for that. I used to have lots of animals until... until the incident. That was two years ago now.zts25694e	What happened?zts25695e	It was late at night and I was on my way to town to give a performance. I had a couple of mercenaries with me for protection from thieves and monsters.zts25696e	When we set up our tents in the mountains, I heard the howls of a creature I couldn't identify coming from somewhere nearby.zts25697e	So I called to the mercenaries and set off to investigate. And then we spotted it. I'd never seen anything like it: a huge monster with massive claws!zts25698e	A few of the mercenaries attacked, but it killed them in an instant, and the others fled in panic!zts25699e	I was overcome with terror, and released my animals, hoping the monster would be distracted by them.zts25700e	But what happened then came as an even bigger surprise. Instead of running away, the animals fought against the terrifying beast! I was so ashamed of my selfishness...zts25701e	That surprises me too. So what happened? Did they defeat the monster?zts25702e	Not exactly... you see, I train my animals for the circus ring, not the boxing ring. They all died senselessly. But they were at least able to injure it and send it running.zts25703e	Afterwards, I decided that was the last time I would ever hire a mercenary. My creatures were clearly so loyal that they would fight by my side, so it was only right that I should train them.zts25704e	I spent the next two years honing my skills, finding ways to train even more capable animals.zts25705e	Ah, so these ones have been trained with your new methods?zts25706e	Just so. Training them is hard work, that's why I only have a few. And there's another reason...zts25707e	Since that night, I've been plagued by nightmares. That monster is always in my thoughts, and I'm too terrified to go out at night.zts25708e	But now I've had enough! It's time to put an end to these nightmares, and the only way to do that is to get revenge on that beast.zts25709e	I see... well, good luck with that!zts25710e	Wait... I... need your help. You know my story now. Will you help me?zts25711e	I'm kinda busy...zts25712e	It won't take long! Please, find the creature for me. I haven't been able to track it down.zts25713e	Sorry, I don't have the time.zts25714e	Hmm... maybe an irresistible reward could change your mind? I'll teach you everything I know about training pets. You'll be able to make your pets more powerful than you can even imagine! How does that offer sound? Tempting?zts25715e	Very tempting... okay. I'll help you.zts25716e	Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Right, we'd best start by searching for clues. I was attacked in the mountains, so that would seem the logical place to start, that's probably where it lives. Are there any mountains near here?zts25717e	Sure, let's go!zts25718e	Pet Trainer Quest 2zts25719e	Where are we?zts25720e	This is Mount Krem, quite close to NosVille.zts25721e	Do you think the monster could be hiding here?zts25722e	Hmm... well the place where we discovered it was definitely very... rocky.zts25723e	Sounds about right! There's a decent chance we'll find it here.zts25724e	That's true. So what do we do now?zts25725e	Follow me, I know someone who always knows exactly what's going on in these parts.zts25726e	Pet Trainer Quest 3zts25727e	Hey, Uncle Carven!zts25728e	Ah, hello there! Long time no see. I see you've brought a guest with you...zts25729e	Yes, this is...zts25730e	Hi, I'm Lucy. Have you seen a terrifying creature around here? About five times the size of a human, long, sharp claws...zts25731e	A monster with long claws? Are you perhaps thinking of a Warepard?zts25732e	But Warepards aren't *that* big, are they?zts25733e	No, that's true, but the rest of the description fits. Aaah! Just a moment. There have indeed been rumours about an unusually large Warepard. The Koaren Sword Fighter at the entrance might know more. Go and ask him.zts25734e	Thank you! Let's go, <pname>!zts25735e	Pet Trainer Quest 4zts25736e	Hello! I'd like to ask you something.zts25737e	Oh, it's you <pname>! I remember the help you gave us. Go on, ask away, I'll do what I can.zts25738e	Have you heard anything about a Giant Warepard?zts25739e	Heard anything? Ha! More than that, I've *seen* the beast with my own eyes.zts25740e	What, really?! Tell us everything!zts25741e	A few days back I was on night patrol and spotted a few monsters running away from something. That already seemed strange... after all, it's usually them doing the chasing!zts25742e	But then I saw what they were running from. A gigantic shadow! It caught up with them and... devoured them all! It was a blood-curdling sight.zts25743e	That must be the shadow of the beast we're trying to track down.zts25744e	I tell you, I ran away in panic. When I returned to the place in daylight, I found claw marks in the rocks. That's when I realised the shadow must have been a Giant Warepard. But no one has ever seen a Warepard of that size before. And I'm still not entirely convinced it really wasn't something else.zts25745e	Can you show us the location? We'd like to search for clues.zts25746e	Are you helping us again, <pname>? Great, thank you! Sure, I'll tell you everything I know.zts25747e	Pet Trainer Quest 5zts25748e	This is the place he told us about.zts25749e	Look there! Huge scratch marks.zts25750e	Do you think they're from your monster?zts25751e	Yes, judging by the size of these tracks. We're really close, I can feel it!zts25752e	Excellent! Then we know it was here recently. Now we just need to work out which way it went.zts25753e	Leave that to me. My animals will be able to track it.zts25754e	(Lucy has her animals pick up the scent.)zts25755e	They've picked up the trail. Follow me!zts25756e	Pet Trainer Quest 6zts25757e	It's run away, come on, let's chase after it!zts25758e	That won't be easy, but we can't give up now.zts25759e	Pet Trainer Quest 7zts25760e	Revenge at last! Thank you.zts25761e	Very happy for you.zts25762e	As promised, I'll now teach you everything I know about training animals, <pname>. Let's head back to NosVille.zts25763e	Pet Trainer Quest 8zts25764e	So, are you ready? The first lesson is how to improve your pet.zts25765e	Yes, I'm ready! Tell me more...zts25766e	Here, take this specialist card first.zts25767e	Pet Trainer Quest 9zts25768e	So if I use this card to transform, I can improve my pets?zts25769e	Exactly, this card transforms you into a Pet Trainer specialist.zts25770e	After transforming, you'll be able to understand the principles of training better.zts25771e	There are three important things when it comes to training animals: taming, training and evolving.zts25772e	Hmm... can you explain more?zts25773e	Sure, let's start with taming. Pet Trainers have two taming skills available to them, both of which require the use of Bait.zts25774e	What's the difference between Tame and Advanced Tame?zts25775e	Animals that you can tame are marked with 1 to 6 stars. The more stars an animal has, the more valuable it is.zts25776e	You can only tame 1 and 2-star creatures with skills. The Tame skill can be used for 1-star animals, while Advanced Tame is needed for 2-star animals.zts25777e	There are a couple of requirements you need to fulfil too. You must have a higher level than the animal you want to tame, and the target must have less than 50% HP.zts25778e	Right, I get it. But how do I get animals with more than 2 stars?zts25779e	An excellent question! You need to train your pets to increase their stars.zts25780e	You can find the training level in your pet's info window, <pname>.zts25781e	You need to summon Sparring Monsters to train your pets. You can find them in Sparring Monster Cages which you can buy from me.zts25782e	What happens when I increase the training level?zts25783e	When a pet's training level increases, its HP, attack power and defence increase as well. Plus at certain levels it can learn special skills.zts25784e	What? Pets have special skills?zts25785e	Absolutely! A pet can have a maximum of two skills.zts25786e	If your pet already has two skills, then one of them will be improved at random.zts25787e	What do you mean by evolving?zts25788e	When a pet reaches the maximum training level, you can increase its star rating with the Evolve skill.zts25789e	When you increase a pet's star rating, it will forget all of its skills and the training level will be reset to 0, but at the same time its maximum training level and stats multiplier will be increased.zts25790e	Okay, I think I get it. Do I need anything else to increase the star rating?zts25791e	You need an essence with the same star rating as the pet you want to upgrade. For example, if you want to upgrade a 2-star pet, you'll need Pet Essence (2 Star). You can extract this essence from pets, but when you do, the pet will be released and you will lose it.zts25792e	That's all for now. The rest you'll learn over time.zts25793e	I'll give you some materials so you can practice. Here you go.zts25794e	Oh, thank you!zts25795e	Pet Trainer Time-Space 1zts25796e	Yuck, it stinks in here! That monster can't be far.zts25797e	You're right, we should proceed with caution.zts25798e	Pet Trainer Time-Space 2zts25799e	(It seems to be badly injured and must have fled through another exit.)zts25800e	Pet Trainer Time-Space 3zts25801e	Do you think the monster is here?zts25802e	Definitely, believe me!zts25803e	Do you want to become a capable Pet Trainer, <pname>?zts25804e	I do! Will you show me what I have to do?zts25805e	Sure, I'll give you a set of tasks to do. After that, your training will be complete. Are you ready? It isn't difficult.zts25806e	Sure, I think I'll manage.zts25808e	That was easy! I'll head back to Lucy.zts25809e	Well done, <pname>! How did it go?zts25810e	It was easier than I expected.zts25811e	You have taken your first steps in a whole new world. Come and visit me when you have time, and I'll give you your next task.zts25812e	Hey <pname>, ready for your next task?zts25813e	I certainly am! What do I have to do this time?zts25815e	So this time I have to tame a higher-level animal?zts25816e	Indeed you do! This time you'll have to use the Advanced Tame skill.zts25817e	Just take your time, be methodical, and you'll manage.zts25818e	I did it! That wasn't quite as easy. I'll go back to Lucy now.zts25819e	Good job, <pname>. I bet that took a bit more effort, huh?zts25821e	Either way, you managed it. In reward, let me give you a new title.zts25822e	Next time you pay me a visit, I'll give you another task.zts25823e	The most important duty of any Pet Trainer is of course training their animals.zts25825e	Alright, I'll try.zts25826e	You did it! Not that I ever doubted it. Your pet's stronger now, isn't it?zts25827e	Yes, that really made a difference.zts25828e	You've done an excellent job.zts25829e	When you're ready, I'll give you your next task.zts25830e	And after that, you'll be ready to train your pets.zts25834e	That was the last task. You're a capable trainer now.

The captain will be able to tell me what the situation is.zts25945e	*zts25946e	Hello <pname>! Great to see you.zts25947e	What's going on here?zts25948e	Our enemies have taken the mine.zts25949e	It happened so fast, we couldn't even get the workers out in time.zts25950e	Now we're doing our best to protect the town.zts25951e	But it's not looking good. The attackers are using powerful weapons.zts25952e	Which is why we need your help, <pname>.zts25953e	I see. What should I do?zts25954e	Your task is clear: We need time to gather our forces. But the enemy is gaining ground too quickly. <pname>, can you stop the assault in Western Mine 1 to buy us some time?zts25955e	*zts25956e	There's the entrance to the mine. But there are too many enemies around. They've got to go!zts25957e	They looked like frogs... Or have I drunk something I shouldn't have?zts25958e	*zts25959e	Good. Into the mine we go.zts25960e	*zts25961e	That should do it. Let's get out of here before I'm surrounded.zts25962e	*zts25963e	I must go and see the captain. Hopefully he'll have good news.zts25964e	*zts25965e	I've defeated a lot of enemies in the mine. But more will come.zts25966e	Thank you! That might have bought us the time we need to assemble our army, <pname>.zts25967e	By the way: While you were gone, some foreigners surrendered to us.zts25968e	Foreigners?zts25969e	Yes. But we can't understand a word they say. They speak a completely different language. We've looked for a translator but there don't seem to be any.zts25970e	Hmm. I think I might know someone who could solve that problem.zts25971e	Really? Someone who speaks this language? Can you bring them here?zts25972e	Haha, no, she isn't a linguistic genius, she's an inventor! I'm sure she'll be able to build you a translation machine.zts25973e	Excellent! Please hurry, we need this machine as quickly as possible. The prisoners seem very anxious.zts25974e	Of course. I'll be back soon. (I must visit Ain in Dragonveil.)zts25975e	*zts25976e	Hello, Ain.zts25977e	Oh, <pname>. Great to see you! What brings you here?zts25978e	Well, it concerns the following...zts25979e	(You tell Ain about the invasion and the prisoners.)zts25980e	But we don't understand their language. Is there something you can do?zts25981e	Hmm, yes, I once worked on a translation machine.zts25982e	Based on the languages the listener speaks, it transforms language signals into magic waves that they can understand.zts25983e	Wow! That's perfect! Could you lend me the device?zts25984e	Unfortunately, I never finished it because I was missing some materials.zts25985e	And if I bring them to you?zts25986e	Then I'll get to work right away.zts25987e	Wonderful. Tell me what you need.zts25988e	*zts25989e	Here, Ain, I hope that's everything.zts25990e	Thank you! Wait a moment. It'll just take a minute.zts25991e	(Ain uses the materials to make the last component for her translation machine.)zts25992e	Done! There you go. I hope the device will serve you well.zts25993e	Thank you! I hope so too, this foreign language is supposed to be... really foreign. See you later!zts25994e	*zts25995e	I've got the translation machine.zts25996e	Thanks, <pname>. Come, I'll take you to the prisoners.zts25997e	Let's go, then. I'm eager to hear what they have to say.zts25998e	*zts25999e	Er, hello... Can you understand me?zts26000e	Oh! Yes, I can understand what you're saying. Finally! We've no time to lose. Please help us!zts26001e	(Ha! Ain is a genius. It really works.)zts26002e	Wait, you're going to answer my questions first! What's your name? Why are you attacking us? And why should I help you?! Tell the truth!zts26003e	My name is Mullang. I belong to the Berum Rebels.zts26004e	My name is <pname>.zts26005e	Who are the Berum Rebels?zts26006e	We're a group of Mullans committed to the truth. We're working against a dictator, Biaron, who's seized power.zts26007e	Aha. So your people are called "Mullans".zts26008e	And why have you attacked us? I don't have anything to do with that!zts26009e	I'll explain the reason for this war to you, and why you've got to help...zts26010e	I'm listening.zts26011e	We, the Mullans, live underground and have built a city there; Undercity.zts26012e	We dig for various minerals and found an energy source that we call 'Ordophy'. This energy brought us some very rapid developments.zts26013e	But there is also a dark side to the Ordophy.zts26014e	When it's converted into energy, toxic substances are produced that make us sick and contaminate our water.zts26015e	A lot of Mullans became ill, and the animals and plants underground mutated.zts26016e	In the face of our crisis, our president, Biaron, and our best inventor, Techron, led an expedition to find a new energy source.zts26017e	But they couldn't find anything. This was right at the end of Biaron's term in office, and he urged Techron to find something quickly so that he would be re-elected.zts26018e	But Techron's report...zts26019e	What about it?zts26020e	The report said that there weren't any other energy sources underground. The only option would be to search above ground.zts26021e	I see. And you didn't want to do that?zts26022e	We have a legend that says our ancestors visited the surface a long time ago - and caused an invasion of surface monsters. So the surface is taboo for us.zts26023e	But Biaron was determined to win the election, so he decided to explore the surface on his own, without the council's approval. Techron climbed up and found an energy source: the Photostone.zts26024e	(Photostone? I've never heard of anything like it.)zts26025e	Techron brought the Photostone to us and studied its unknown power.zts26026e	He found out that the stone radiated a lot of energy, but without causing any harmful side effects.zts26027e	So Biaron insisted that more Photostones should be fetched from the surface.zts26028e	But Techron had other plans. The more he discovered about the stone, the more obvious its dark side became.zts26029e	A dark side? What does that mean?zts26030e	I have no idea. It was kept top secret.zts26031e	Techron demanded further investigations and refused to obey Biaron.zts26032e	Biaron, on the other hand, labelled Techron a traitor with connections to the surface. When the council disagreed, he dissolved it just like that. He then declared himself president for life.zts26033e	Techron disappeared, no one knows where.zts26034e	Biaron didn't waste any time and prepared to invade the surface, but a few Mullans, myself among others, doubted whether this was the right path.zts26035e	Tieclo was our leader.zts26036e	He used to sit on the council.zts26037e	Now he's the founder of the Berum Rebels. I'm his right hand.zts26038e	We built a hideout on the surface, and from there we tried to disrupt Biaron's operations and find Techron.zts26039e	Unfortunately, without success. Biaron started his invasion.zts26040e	I see. That explains our current situation.zts26041e	Our hideout was discovered by Biaron's army, and attacked.zts26042e	Tieclo and his comrades put up a fight but didn't stand a chance against the army. Everyone apart from me was arrested. I know where they've taken them. They'll probably be executed soon.zts26043e	Hmm... Then I'm guessing you want me to rescue them, right?zts26044e	Yes. If you rescue them, we'll help you to end this war. Believe me, you're going to be in dire need of our knowledge.zts26045e	I'm sure we will be. Okay, I'll rescue your friends.zts26046e	Thank you, thank you so much. Follow me.zts26047e	Do you believe him, <pname>?zts26048e	Do we have a choice? We don't know anything about the enemy.zts26049e	That's just it. What if it's a trap? Please be careful, <pname>.zts26050e	I always am. Don't worry.zts26051e	*zts26052e	This is where I last saw my comrades.zts26053e	Then we should search in the forest.zts26054e	Okay. Let's go.zts26055e	*zts26056e	They've already moved on.zts26057e	This report says... Ah, I know. Follow me.zts26058e	*zts26059e	This is the place mentioned in the report.zts26060e	I hope we'll find them here.zts26061e	*zts26062e	We've got to lose the ones on our tail!zts26063e	Then let's defeat the enemies blocking our way.zts26064e	*zts26065e	Okay, I've defeated all our opponents. What about our pursuers?zts26066e	No one in sight. Let's get out of here quickly.zts26067e	*zts26068e	We're safe.zts26069e	Thanks, <pname>. May I introduce: Tieclo, leader of the Berum Rebels.zts26070e	Pleased to meet you.zts26071e	The pleasure is all mine. Thank you very much for your efforts in rescuing us.zts26072e	So you're the leader of the Berum Rebels? Welcome. I'm responsible for the defence here.zts26073e	What's the situation at the front?zts26074e	It's at a standstill. The enemy hasn't received any more reinforcements, so we've been able to hold the line. As soon as our own reinforcements arrive, we'll begin the counter offensive.zts26075e	A moment, please! You know how the enemy army is organised?zts26076e	Have you seen robots in their ranks?zts26077e	Uh, no? What sort of robots?zts26078e	Then you should throw everything you've got at pushing the enemy back into the mines as quickly as possible.zts26079e	The Mullan army is made up of two groups: first comes the regular infantry, then come the robots.zts26080e	Up until now, I've only seen the infantry. The drilling probably hasn't yet got far enough to...zts26081e	Wait, wait! Robots? You mean... Combat robots?zts26082e	Yes, advanced technology. Each robot is as strong as ten soldiers.zts26083e	Oh.zts26084e	And what happens once the drilling has finished?zts26085e	Then the robots will come through and rip you to shreds.zts26086e	Then... we've got to stop the drilling!zts26087e	Right, it's our best chance. We have to get to the mine and put a stop to the work going on there.zts26088e	Hmm. Can we break through there?zts26089e	Not without reinforcements.zts26090e	But I have some special forces I could lend you.zts26091e	Great, I'll take them. Together, we'll hopefully make it to the mine.zts26092e	And you'll follow with your troops once the reinforcements arrive?zts26093e	I will, you have my word!zts26094e	The Berum Rebels are with you too!zts26095e	Thanks. Let's be having those special forces. I need to go.zts26096e	I'll get right to it. Good luck!zts26097e	*zts26098e	This is the cave where the enemy is digging. Quite a lot of enemies here.zts26099e	Indeed. Come on, let's finish them.zts26100e	*zts26101e	The excavation work has stopped. Are we done here?zts26102e	This won't stop them for long. We Mullans can be quite stubborn. They'll send new soldiers soon, or dig somewhere else.zts26103e	We need a more permanent solution. Let's talk to the captain.zts26104e	*zts26105e	There you are, <pname>. How did it go?zts26106e	We've blocked off the entrance to the cave, the enemy can't get out. But it won't hold them off for long.zts26107e	Right then. Anyway, we now have enough time to gather our forces.zts26108e	Since Biaron's army won't give up...zts26109e	... We need more drastic measures.zts26110e	Such as?zts26111e	A ceasefire.zts26112e	What?! Er... I don't think Biaron would agree to that. It would make him look weak and he'd lose power.zts26113e	The Mullans don't want a war, they want the energy source: Photostones.zts26114e	You think we should give them some?zts26115e	Exactly. Or is there a reason not to?zts26116e	Well, there's just a small problem.zts26117e	We don't know what Photostones are. Can you describe them in a bit more detail?zts26118e	They're everywhere here! Maybe you call them something else...zts26119e	You've seen the stones?zts26120e	Yes, of course.zts26121e	Can you take us to them?zts26122e	Of course. Come with me!zts26123e	*zts26124e	Here, this is a Photostone.zts26125e	Ah! You mean Time-Space Stones! We don't use them as an energy source.zts26126e	A... Time-Space...?zts26127e	Yes. Very unstable and dangerous. They're connected to other dimensions. No one can predict what will happen if you use one.zts26128e	Maybe that was the reason why Techron warned against using them.zts26129e	Perhaps he entered a different Time-Space.zts26130e	Hmm... Nothing good can come of it if Biaron gets his hands on these stones.zts26131e	But what should we do?zts26132e	(A soldier approaches.)zts26133e	<pname>! The captain is looking for you. We've got a big problem!zts26134e	All right, I'm coming.zts26135e	*zts26136e	We've got an urgent matter, <pname>.zts26137e	The enemy is digging in Western Mine 2. The hole is still small but a few soldiers are already getting through.zts26138e	Damn, already?zts26139e	We have to recapture Western Mine 2, <pname>.zts26140e	Can you go there and defeat the enemy?zts26141e	Don't worry, they won't get past me.zts26142e	Until you get back, <pname>, I'll have a think about how we can end the war.zts26143e	*zts26144e	(Enemies have reached even this far already. I'll show 'em!)zts26145e	*zts26146e	(Done. On to the mine!)zts26147e	*zts26148e	(More opponents. I've got to defeat them if I want to get to the mine.)zts26149e	*zts26150e	*zts26151e	*zts26152e	(There are more than I thought. But I'll destroy them!)zts26153e	*zts26154e	(I think that'll do. I'll go back first.)zts26155e	(Hopefully Tieclo has found a solution in the meantime.)zts26156e	*zts26157e	I've defeated the opponents in Western Mine 2! It should be safe there for a while.zts26158e	Thank you, <pname>! Unfortunately it still doesn't look good for us. Headquarters has reported that we can't expect any reinforcements.zts26159e	On top of that, many of our soldiers are wounded and they're all exhausted.zts26160e	Damn it. Any suggestions?zts26161e	<pname>, I can only see one way to end the war.zts26162e	We must advance into Undercity with our remaining forces.zts26163e	Impossible! We're barely holding the front as it is!zts26164e	Maybe, but even if that works, you'll lose eventually. Or do you see things differently?zts26165e	I... That... No.zts26166e	Hence my suggestion: a quick, direct advance into the enemy's headquarters.zts26167e	A handful of veterans could manage it.zts26168e	The Berum Rebels and <pname> will lead them. We'll concentrate solely on pushing forward.zts26169e	The key is to reach Undercity as quickly as possible.zts26170e	Tricky. But worth a try.zts26171e	However, we need equipment for this.zts26172e	The rebels barely have any weapons, and even less ammunition.zts26173e	<pname>, can you get your hands on weapons and bullets from the enemy for us? Even broken ones are good. We can repair them.zts26174e	In the meantime, I'll search for volunteers among the veterans for this suicide mission.zts26175e	Okay, I'll get something together for you. See you in a bit!zts26176e	*zts26177e	I've brought what I could find. Is this enough?zts26178e	Yes, thank you! We can work with it.zts26179e	Captain, are the veterans ready?zts26180e	Yes, ready and waiting.zts26181e	Fantastic! Let's go!zts26182e	*zts26183e	Is this the way to Undercity?zts26184e	Yes. But the enemy is everywhere, how are we supposed to...zts26185e	You're right. I'll take care of it.zts26186e	*zts26187e	All enemies have been defeated. Shall we go?zts26188e	The rebels and I are ready, <pname>.zts26189e	*zts26190e	The enemy's headquarters...zts26191e	Yes. And the whole place is full of soldiers.zts26192e	Are they expecting us?zts26193e	It doesn't matter, we'll deal with them and press on. Follow me!zts26194e	*zts26195e	Oof, there were a lot. Are you all okay?zts26196e	A few of us are injured but we're all still standing.zts26197e	Undercity isn't far now.zts26198e	Good. Let's move.zts26199e	*zts26200e	We're quite a way down, how much longer will it take us to get to Undercity?zts26201e	We'll see the city as soon as we get past this area.zts26202e	The army is stationed here, though... Hopefully everything will go well.zts26203e	*zts26204e	The army is based in this area. Good luck to all of us.zts26205e	*zts26206e	Biaron's soldiers are nowhere to be seen. And where is Biaron?zts26207e	He must be in the VIP Bunker.zts26208e	I know where that is. This way!zts26209e	*zts26210e	Biaron is gone.zts26211e	But only just. Come on, let's follow that monster!zts26212e	Our informants say that he wants to get to another bunker.zts26213e	*zts26214e	*zts26215e	Is this the bunker where Biaron is hiding?zts26216e	Yes. Now we've got him!zts26217e	*zts26218e	We did it!zts26219e	Now we've just got to get him into prison.zts26220e	Heh, Tieclo, Biaron's entourage will try to free him.zts26221e	Then I guess we'll have to get them to unfollow him.zts26222e	*zts26223e	Done! It's this way to the prison.zts26224e	The end of the war is now in sight. What will you do afterwards?zts26225e	Oh, I still have lots to do.zts26226e	All the problems caused by the war...zts26227e	It'll take quite some time to sort it all out.zts26228e	Can I still count on you, <pname>?zts26229e	We need to stabilise Undercity and we don't have enough people.zts26230e	Of course, I'm happy to help!zts26231e	*zts26232e	<pname>, I have a first mission for you.zts26233e	A few royals fled to the area east of the Power Plant.zts26234e	They want to occupy the Power Plant and have taken workers hostage to blackmail us into releasing Biaron.zts26235e	According to our informants, they're hiding in a bunker near the Power Plant.zts26236e	Can you deal with them?zts26237e	Of course, such a threat cannot go unanswered.zts26238e	*zts26239e	This way is east. It looks kind of eerie.zts26240e	*zts26241e	Is the Power Plant in this area? I can hardly breathe!zts26242e	As soon as the royals have been dealt with, I'm out of here.zts26243e	*zts26244e	The royals could have me right where they want me.zts26245e	I'd better clear the area first before entering their hideout.zts26246e	*zts26247e	Ha, I found your hideout! Brace yourselves!zts26248e	*zts26249e	You're safe. My name is <pname>, I'm from the surface. Who are you and what are you doing here?zts26250e	I'm Techron's AI assistant, Allos. Thank you for saving me. They wanted to shut me down.zts26251e	I came here to get a sample of the Photostone for Techron's research.zts26252e	But Biaron's soldiers caught me.zts26253e	Oh, are you the famous Techron's assistant?zts26254e	Yes. I've established a connection with him. He'd like to talk to you.zts26255e	(It clicks, chatters and squeals, then Allos' voice changes.)zts26256e	Uh, hello? Can you hear me, <pname>?zts26257e	Yes, I can hear you. Is that Techron?zts26258e	Yes, this is Techron.zts26259e	Great. Listen: Wherever you are, you can come back.zts26260e	The war is over. Biaron is in prison. You don't have to hide anymore.zts26261e	I know. But I can't come back yet.zts26262e	For the Mullans' future, I have to keep researching the Photostones. But the stones are dangerous, so I'd rather stay away and keep hidden.zts26263e	Besides, there are still a lot of people who are loyal to Biaron. If they caught me, they could demand Biaron's release in exchange for me.zts26264e	So I won't be returning to Undercity for now. But I can trust you, <pname> from the surface.zts26265e	I'm sorry to trouble you, <pname>... Can I ask you a favour?zts26266e	I've come up with a theory about how to control the Photostones' energy, but I don't have the right test materials. My assistant did try to help me but he's too weak to go to dangerous places.zts26267e	Could you bring me the materials for my research?zts26268e	That would be fantastic. Then I'll contact you via Allos. You'll find him in the area around the Power Plant.zts26269e	And if you return to Undercity, please don't tell anyone that we've talked or where Allos is, okay?zts26270e	(It clicks, chatters and squeals, and the connection ends.)zts26271e	*zts26272e	I've done it.zts26273e	Great work!zts26274e	What happens now?zts26275e	Hmm, let me think...zts26276e	Ah, please go and see the Power Plant Manager. He wanted something.zts26277e	You'll find him between the east and south gates of the city.zts26278e	*zts26279e	Hello. I heard you need help?zts26280e	Oh, aren't you the adventurer from the surface? Welcome.zts26281e	I'm responsible for the areas to the east and south of the Power Plant.zts26282e	Everything is fine in the east, but there are problems in the south.zts26283e	What's happened in the south?zts26284e	We built our first power plant in the south.zts26285e	Accordingly, everything there is contaminated. Since then, the power plant has been shut down.zts26286e	A guard usually patrols in the area so that no one goes near the contaminated water - and so that the mutants contaminated by the water don't come near us.zts26287e	But the soldier hasn't returned from duty. It's been months.zts26288e	We don't expect that he's still alive. But maybe you can at least collect his remains so that his family can give him a proper burial.zts26289e	Oh, I'm sorry for those he's left behind. I'll look for the guard and bring back what I find.zts26290e	Thanks. Please make a start in Polluted Area 1. You can reach it via the Southern Basement Path.zts26291e	*zts26292e	There's the Southern Basement Path. Pooh, something here smells a bit off.zts26293e	*zts26294e	The missing soldier was posted here.zts26295e	I'll get rid of the monsters first, before I look for him.zts26296e	*zts26297e	That's it. Onwards into the cave!zts26298e	*zts26299e	It's hard to believe but he's still alive, even if he's unconscious.zts26300e	He won't be of any help to me like this. Well, I got here, so I can get back again too.zts26301e	*zts26302e	I've found the missing soldier! He's unconscious, though.zts26303e	I'm so relieved! We'll take care of him.zts26304e	Thanks. Is there anything else you want me to do?zts26305e	Hmm... No, not right now. But please come back once he's regained consciousness.zts26306e	We need to ask what happened to him.zts26307e	Oh, the Railway Manager was asking for you while you were away.zts26308e	Please go and see him.zts26309e	I will. Let me know when the soldier wakes up!zts26310e	*zts26311e	Hello! Are you the Railway Manager who was asking for me?zts26312e	Yes, that's me. Pleased to meet you. I'm responsible for Undercity's rail network and...zts26313e	... and there's a problem with it.zts26314e	Yes, to be more precise, in the northern part.zts26315e	Truth be told, the tracks were built for the invasion, but now the war's over, they could greatly facilitate trade between our peoples.zts26316e	If Biaron's supporters weren't there, blocking the way.zts26317e	Some damage also needs to be repaired.zts26318e	So my question would be: Can you get the royals off the tracks, and gather the materials for the repairs while you're there?zts26319e	Of course. I'll take care of it.zts26321e	Someone's got to explain the new world order to those old reactionaries, anyway.zts26322e	*zts26323e	Up here.zts26324e	*zts26325e	Aha, I've found the royals.zts26326e	*zts26327e	I still need the materials for repairing the tracks.zts26328e	*zts26329e	Right, the royals are out of the way and I have the materials for the train tracks.zts26330e	Thank you! In the meantime, the soldier that you rescued has woken up.zts26331e	I'm glad to hear it! Then I'll go and see the Power Plant Manager.zts26332e	*zts26333e	I heard that the soldier has woken up?zts26334e	Yes, he has. Welcome back, <pname>.zts26335e	You saved me, <pname>. Thank you, thank you so much.zts26336e	My pleasure. How are you doing?zts26337e	Getting better, slowly.zts26338e	Can you tell me what happened to you in the Polluted Area?zts26339e	I can try... as far as I know.zts26340e	It started with rumours of strange sounds coming from the Polluted Area.zts26341e	Not long after that, a few guards disappeared.zts26342e	Not a nice feeling when you've been assigned there yourself!zts26343e	Then I heard a strange howling while on patrol.zts26344e	My buddy and I egged each other on and we went for it.zts26345e	When we reached Polluted Area 2, we saw a large shadow.zts26346e	Large shadow?zts26347e	Yes. Even bigger than the giant mushrooms you often encounter in the Polluted Area.zts26348e	We ran.zts26349e	Hid in a cave in Area 1.zts26350e	From there, we could hear something running around outside.zts26351e	The heavy footsteps disappeared at some point and we wanted to get out.zts26352e	But the there were lots of creatures at the entrance.zts26353e	They looked just like the big shadow, only much smaller.zts26354e	We tried to fight our way through but there were too many. They knocked us unconscious.zts26355e	I don't know why they didn't kill us.zts26356e	Woah, you've been through a lot.zts26357e	Thanks for the information, it's very helpful. I should go and look around the cave and Polluted Area 2.zts26358e	*zts26359e	(Hmm... These footprints and green lumps remind me of Mother Cuby...)zts26360e	*zts26361e	(There's a lot of slime here. This must be the cave.)zts26362e	*zts26363e	(Phew, that was close. I won't manage it alone.)zts26364e	(Maybe the Power Plant Manager will have an idea.)zts26365e	*zts26366e	I've found the monster's hiding place.zts26367e	Have you seen it? What are we dealing with?zts26368e	It's a giant made out of moss and slime. He doesn't smell too great.zts26369e	And is bloody strong. I had to make a run for it.zts26370e	I see. You need the army. You're best off asking the acting president, Tieclo, for support.zts26371e	Okay. Wait, "acting president"?zts26372e	Yes, Tieclo has proclaimed himself interim president, until the city is back on its feet.zts26373e	Riiight. Well, I'll go and see him then.zts26374e	(Tieclo has appointed himself acting president? Hopefully he won't become the next dictator...)zts26375e	*zts26376e	<pname>, what brings you to me?zts26377e	There's a serious problem. I need your help.zts26378e	What's happened? Is it Biaron's supporters?zts26379e	Did you hear about the guards who disappeared in the Polluted Area to the south?zts26380e	Yes, why?zts26381e	I found out what happened to them: a Moss Giant.zts26382e	Even I couldn't defeat him. We need the army.zts26383e	Hmm. You've come at a bad time; the army is rounding up the rest of Biaron's followers at the moment.zts26384e	I'm afraid I can't give you any troops.zts26385e	You seem to have changed since you've become president. Don't forget that this is about your people. This Moss Giant must be defeated!zts26386e	What are you trying to say? I'm only doing this job temporarily. As soon as Biaron's supporters are history, I will of course call an election.zts26387e	And for peace in Undercity, Biaron's supporters are simply a more pressing issue than the Moss Giant at the moment.zts26388e	It would cost us too much to worry about such a trivial matter now of all times.zts26389e	You seem to be enjoying the power of command, Tieclo. Mind that you don't suddenly become lifetime president.zts26390e	I'll take care of the Moss Giant in the meantime. I'll do it, somehow.zts26391e	*zts26392e	I've finally defeated the Moss Giant. The area is safe now.zts26393e	Thank you, <pname>!zts26394e	Here's a little something for your efforts.zts26395e	(I need to speak to someone sensible about Tieclo's change of attitude.)zts26396e	(Maybe Techron? His AI assistant is in the Power Plant.)zts26397e	*zts26398e	(I should get rid of the monsters in this area to be on the safe side.)zts26399e	*zts26400e	Hello <pname>.zts26401e	Hello! Can you contact Techron for me?zts26402e	Just a moment please.zts26403e	(It clicks, chatters and squeals.)zts26404e	Hello? <pname>? What do you want?zts26405e	I have a request.zts26406e	It looks to me like Tieclo is well on his way to becoming a dictator after declaring himself acting president.zts26407e	Someone should have a serious talk with him before we end up with a second Biaron on our hands.zts26408e	And so I thought of you, Techron. Don't you want to come back to Undercity?zts26409e	No. I'm a scientist, not a sordid politician.zts26410e	But your people are on a course to another crisis.zts26411e	Hmph. Okay fine, <pname>, let's make a deal.zts26412e	What sort of deal would that be?zts26413e	I can only come back once I've fully investigated the Photostone.zts26414e	Nothing is more important to me.zts26415e	If you help me stabilise the stone, I'll return to Undercity and make sure that Tieclo doesn't snap, okay?zts26416e	Fine. What exactly do you need me to do?zts26417e	We'll start with something simple: I need wires and circuits.zts26418e	They were installed into all the war machinery.zts26419e	So you need to scrap the war machines, pull all the wires and circuits out of them, and take the whole lot to Allos, okay?zts26420e	*zts26421e	Here are the materials you wanted.zts26422e	Thanks. I'm establishing a connection to Techron...zts26423e	Thank you. This all looks quite usable.zts26424e	But I'm guessing that's not everything?zts26425e	Correct, now comes the hard part.zts26426e	We Mullans don't use magic, there's a lack of minerals down here.zts26427e	The Photostone, though, is radiating a great deal of magic power and I'm having difficulty controlling it.zts26428e	You don't happen to know of a mineral on the surface that can absorb magic power?zts26429e	Absorb magic... Yes, I might have an idea.zts26430e	Really?! Great, then bring it to me, otherwise I won't be able to continue my research.zts26431e	Okay. Then I'll take the mineral to Allos.zts26432e	*zts26433e	*zts26434e	Here: Dratanium and a Guardian's Magic Orb.zts26435e	Wow, you really have some remarkable minerals up there.zts26436e	Yes, but even higher up. In the sky.zts26437e	In the sky? How can there be minerals in the sky?zts26438e	You absolutely have to explain it to me when we have more time.zts26439e	Haha, with pleasure.zts26440e	Excellent. Now for the last materials that I still need.zts26441e	I'm listening. What should I bring?zts26442e	*zts26443e	There you go. Is that it?zts26444e	Yes. I'm taking all the materials to Techron now.zts26445e	This is going to take a while, so be prepared for a bit of a wait.zts26446e	Okay, got it.zts26447e	(Then I might as well go back to Undercity to kill some time.)zts26448e	*zts26449e	(That's strange, the city is crawling with Mullan soldiers.)zts26450e	(What's happened?)zts26451e	Hey, can you tell me what's going on here?zts26452e	Biaron and his supporters have broken out of prison.zts26453e	Martial law has been declared while we look for them.zts26454e	Talk to Mullang if you want to know more.zts26455e	I've got to go.zts26456e	(Huh, then I should go and see Mullang.)zts26457e	*zts26458e	Mullang! Biaron's broken out of prison?zts26459e	Yes. The royals' spies were working together with traitors at the prison.zts26460e	Damn it. Do you know where Biaron is?zts26461e	They were last seen on the Western Basement Path.zts26462e	It leads to Techron's old laboratory, but that's been sealed since Techron was exiled.zts26463e	Okay, understood.zts26464e	I need your help, <pname>. If Biaron is amassing his entire entourage around him, he can muster considerable fighting power. Our position, on the other hand, is anything but secure.zts26465e	All right, I'll go west.zts26466e	Thanks. Our soldiers will follow you.zts26467e	*zts26468e	(This is the way to the lab. The soldiers here are searching for Biaron.)zts26469e	*zts26470e	I've found the royals. Biaron must be very close.zts26471e	Let's break through!zts26472e	*zts26473e	Good, they're all taken care of.zts26474e	(A soldier approaches.)zts26475e	<pname>, we've found Biaron's hideout. But they're too strong for us, we can't get inside.zts26476e	He's on the Lower Laboratory Level. Can you support our advance?zts26477e	Okay, we'll go together.zts26478e	*zts26479e	Lots of royals on the move here. Not for much longer.zts26480e	*zts26481e	So, the royals are defeated. Let's go.zts26482e	*zts26483e	Hmm, a gate. Biaron must be on the other side.zts26484e	*zts26485e	<pname>, great to see you! Have you defeated Biaron?zts26486e	Yes, he won't be troubling us anymore. Although he said something very strange before he died...zts26487e	(You repeat to Tieclo what Biaron said to you.)zts26488e	That's ridiculous.zts26489e	If you consider how dangerous the stone is, it could be.zts26490e	But Techron is a hero to us! I'm not giving any orders without proof!zts26491e	Understandable. I'll go and look for evidence in the lab.zts26492e	*zts26493e	Hmm, where haven't I been yet... Maybe I'll find something upstairs.zts26494e	*zts26495e	Oh, are they Techron's AI robots?zts26496e	They've got to go.zts26497e	*zts26498e	Wait, maybe I can find some proof in these AIs.zts26499e	*zts26500e	Hello! Do you know what this is?zts26501e	Hello. Looks like a memory chip.zts26502e	Memory chip?zts26503e	Yes, for saving information.zts26504e	Can you read this information?zts26505e	Of course. Won't take long.zts26506e	(The engineer fiddles with a machine, which then spits out multiple sheets of paper.)zts26507e	Here, this is what was saved on the chip.zts26508e	Let me see... Hmm... No, that's no use. Oh, wait! My name is on here!zts26509e	<Research Journal 1>zts26510e	Day.Month.Yearzts26511e	With the materials <pname> brought me, I was finally able to build the device that should be able to control the Photostone's magic power.zts26512e	Hopefully my theory is correct.zts26513e	I'm about to test it.zts26514e	<Research Journal 2>zts26515e	I've connected the device to the Photostone.zts26516e	The values are stable.zts26517e	But it's still too early to make any concrete assertions.zts26518e	I'll keep observing it.zts26519e	<Research Journal 3>zts26520e	Something is wrong with the device. The stone's magic power seems to be getting stronger.zts26521e	That shouldn't be happening.zts26522e	I need a different measuring device...zts26523e	<Research Journal 4>zts26524e	The magic power is increasing at an alarming rate. My researchers and engineers are going crazy and can't think about anything else.zts26525e	I have a headache and keep hearing strange noises.zts26526e	The Photostone... I must... Photostone...zts26527e	<Research Journal 5>zts26528e	We need ALL the Photostones! They will make the Mullans invincible.zts26529e	I should go through with it and open the gate...zts26530e	All the Photostones...zts26531e	Biaron was right. Here are the coordinates for Techron's Lab.zts26532e	I'll probably have to pay the secret lab a visit.zts26533e	*zts26534e	(Oh, this gate is new to me. I think it wants me to go through.)zts26535e	*zts26536e	(They must be the engineers and researchers Techron mentioned in his journal. I can't do anything for those poor souls, except redeem them.)zts26537e	*zts26538e	(What machinery makes that noise...? Never mind, it's the right direction at least.)zts26539e	*zts26540e	(Another gate. The noises are coming from the other side. I'll have a look.)zts26541e	*zts26542e	(I only just made it. If this thing attacks Undercity, we're all done for. I have to inform Tieclo immediately.)zts26543e	*zts26544e	Tieclo, Biaron was right. Techron had a dark plan.zts26545e	Here, this is information from Techron's AI robots.zts26546e	(You show him the research journal that was extracted from the memory chip.)zts26547e	That's...zts26548e	And I found a dangerous machine in the Secret Lab.zts26549e	A monster of a robot that calls itself Giant Arma. I couldn't defeat him.zts26550e	If you don't send the army, he'll flatten Undercity like a pancake.zts26551e	The situation is serious. But I can't send the army - the fight against the royals has cost us too much power and too many materials.zts26552e	<pname>, I need your help to get the army ready for action again.zts26553e	I'm at your disposal. After all, this concerns every single Mullan living in Undercity.zts26554e	Thank you. Please talk to the Undercity Engineer, he handles our ammunition supplies.zts26555e	*zts26556e	Hello, Tieclo sent me. He said you need help?zts26557e	Ah, good that you're here.zts26558e	I make ammunition for our soldiers but I'm missing some materials.zts26559e	Can you get me everything I need?zts26560e	That would be great. You'll get the materials from the machine soldiers.zts26561e	And I don't want to rush you, but... The quicker the better.zts26562e	*zts26563e	Here are the materials you wanted.zts26564e	And in such good condition! Thank you.zts26565e	I'm glad you're happy.zts26566e	Can you also have a word with the cook while I get to work on the ammunition? She was complaining that she didn't have some ingredients.zts26567e	*zts26568e	*zts26569e	Oh, how wonderful, that looks really fresh! Thank you!zts26570e	Very nice, I can really...zts26571e	Oh, and drop in on the engineer, would you? He's been grumbling to himself the whole time. I can't stand it any longer!zts26572e	*zts26573e	Hello. Do you maybe need a helping hand?zts26574e	A hand? Why not, but I'd prefer two hands with at least two legs attached. With a body in between, even, if it can't be avoided.zts26575e	Haha, I can help you there. What do you want me to do?zts26576e	I'm supposed to produce armour plating and communication devices for the army, but I'm missing some materials.zts26577e	No problem, I can get you what you need.zts26578e	Excellent! Just take the machine soldiers apart, they contain everything I need.zts26579e	*zts26580e	Yup, these materials should be enough. Thank you.zts26581e	It was my pleasure. Now I can...zts26582e	... go and see Tieclo, he's looking for you. Good luck!zts26583e	*zts26584e	Hello Tieclo. You wanted to talk to me?zts26585e	Yes, <pname>. Thanks to your help, our army is now adequately equipped.zts26586e	I will give the order to attack Giant Arma immediately.zts26587e	<pname>, can you support them in defeating Giant Arma?zts26588e	Of course.zts26589e	But just so we're clear: I'm fight for the Mullan people, not for you.zts26590e	If that makes you feel better, fine. Your motivations are irrelevant to me as long as Giant Arma disappears.zts26591e	*zts26592e	Welcome back! You did it. Is it all over?zts26593e	Not quite. I thought Techron would be controlling Giant Arma, but he wasn't inside.zts26594e	Are you sure? Hmm, then Giant Arma was probably AI controlled.zts26595e	Right. I've defeated Giant Arma but Techron was nowhere to be seen.zts26596e	We've got to find him before he causes any more chaos.zts26597e	I can assure you: my informants are working around the clock. And I'll dispatch soldiers to patrol the area and take a look around.zts26598e	Okay. But keep an eye on the rest of Techron's army too!zts26599e	Above all, we need a cure for Techron. Without him, it'll get dark in Undercity.zts26600e	It's imperative that we find him, and in one piece at that.zts26601e	<pname>, can you continue to help us?zts26602e	Why not. Solving problems is my speciality.zts26603e	*zts26604e	You're not particularly bright, are you? You're supposed to be locking Techron up, not me.zts26605e	Don't talk rubbish. You've done enough to put you behind bars for quite a while.zts26606e	All that sun on the surface obviously hasn't done your brain much good. Let me give you a hand.zts26607e	Oh, with what, exactly?zts26608e	Why do you think I'm here?zts26609e	Because Techron thwarted your despotic plans?zts26610e	Nonsense with a side-serving of more nonsense. He's a researcher in body and soul. And was, incidentally, responsible for my escape.zts26611e	You don't believe me? I made a deal with him.zts26612e	A... What are you talking about?zts26613e	Stop interrupting me and listen, I don't like repeating myself!zts26614e	While I was sitting in jail, Techron's AI robot came to me.zts26615e	We talked - Techron and I.zts26616e	He said he could arrange for my escape, and we should rule over Undercity together. His only condition was that he received all the Photostones on the surface.zts26617e	(That's hard to believe. Did Techron really do that?)zts26618e	Did I have a choice? Of course I took him up on his offer. That's how I got out of prison.zts26619e	However, I didn't feel the need to share my power with Techron. As a free man with a lot of supporters, it was easy for me to become sole ruler again.zts26620e	So you're here to kill Techron, right?zts26621e	For the sake of the Photostones, no! He's too valuable as a researcher. I just wanted to - control him, oppress him, enslave him - you know. As you do, when you're in power.zts26622e	I did meet him in the lab, though, and...zts26623e	Well, he looked pretty deranged.zts26624e	He was completely obsessed with the Photostones and had this kind of dark aura. Really chilling!zts26625e	He probably wouldn't even stop at destroying Undercity if it served his goals.zts26626e	You can't control someone like that. Someone like that has to be stopped.zts26627e	So... I shot him. Stupidly, it wasn't him at all.zts26628e	He'd created an AI robot in his own image.zts26629e	My supporters and I fought against the robots and the mad scientists, but we had to retreat here.zts26630e	Do you get it now? Techron is more dangerous than me!zts26631e	Assuming you're telling the truth...zts26632e	Techron would do anything to get the Photostones. First occupying Undercity, and then taking the surface.zts26633e	It's possible, but I'll only believe you if you give me proof.zts26634e	Argh! If you don't believe me, he will destroy EVERYTHING!! You've got to...zts26635e	(Shots fire. Biaron falls down dead.)zts26636e	Oh my!zts26637e	(An unknown robot charges off.)zts26638e	That must have been one of Techron's robots. I've got to talk to Tieclo about this.zts26639e	*zts26640e	Do you know where your companions are being held captive?zts26641e	Yes, they should be here.zts26642e	Then let's go and release them.zts26643e	*zts26644e	The prisoners aren't here.zts26645e	They must have been moved.zts26646e	Mullang! I've found a document that was left behind.zts26647e	Ah, it says here where they're going. Come on, let's go after them!zts26648e	*zts26649e	The prisoners must be somewhere here. We'll save them!zts26650e	Yes. Hurry!zts26651e	*zts26652e	Over there, they're the prisoners.zts26653e	Yes, those are my companions. Free them quickly, before more enemies come.zts26654e	Mullang, we have many wounded but none of them critically. And Tieclo is fine.zts26655e	Mullang! I knew you would rescue me. Who's this you've brought with you?zts26656e	(In the distance, there's the sound of approaching enemies.)zts26657e	We should save the talking for later. Can you walk?zts26658e	Yes, I'm fine. Let's get out of here quickly.zts26659e	This way!zts26660e	*zts26661e	Biaron! It's over! Give yourself up!zts26662e	And why should I do that?zts26663e	You're surrounded.zts26664e	Oh really? It doesn't look that way to me!zts26665e	(Biaron pushes a button. Smoke fills the room and a machine starts up.)zts26666e	Damn it! I can't see anything. Biaron!zts26667e	It's far from over yet, you traitors!zts26668e	(Biaron is riding a machine that carries him out of the bunker.)zts26669e	Biaron is getting away from us. He's too fast.zts26670e	Arrrgh!zts26671e	Let's go.zts26672e	*zts26673e	There are a lot of footprints here. He must be close by.zts26674e	Then let's go, let's catch Biaron and end this war.zts26675e	*zts26676e	We've got you this time, Biaron!zts26677e	Your hunger for power ends here!zts26678e	Hmph. I'm afraid I'll have to agree with you.zts26679e	Excellent work. Arrest me.zts26680e	Uh, really? You're not pulling one last toad out of your sleeve?zts26681e	Me?! Whatever are you thinking of.zts26682e	I'm completely harmless and obedient. There's no reason to kill me.zts26683e	But you will be sentenced by law.zts26684e	At least the law won't kill me. Get on with it then, send me to prison.zts26685e	I won't tell anyone how stupid you look right now, dictator's word of honour.zts26686e	(Biaron's supporters approach.)zts26687e	All right. We should imprison him first and then think about what he's planning.zts26688e	*zts26689e	I've defeated all the royals. What's that robot that they attacked?zts26690e	Thank you for saving me.zts26691e	Oh, you're alive... er, still functioning.zts26692e	It's still dangerous, there are enemies all over the place here.zts26693e	Get yourself to safety. I'll follow when the rest have been dealt with.zts26694e	I... check... result: to be done.zts26695e	Okay. Then I'll see you outside. (The voice sounded a little strange...)zts26696e	*zts26697e	Phew, defeating those monsters wasn't easy. Hopefully I'll find the missing people here.zts26698e	(You find a Mullan in a hole on the corner.)zts26699e	Someone's here!zts26700e	(Hmm, he's not moving.zts26701e	But luckily he's still breathing. I'll get him out.)zts26702e	*zts26703e	(Pollutus' body had disintegrated into several parts, but they are reassembling.)zts26704e	He just won't die! I need help.zts26705e	Let's get out of here quickly before he completely reassembles himself.zts26706e	*zts26707e	Oh, who would've thought there would be such a big, hidden area here.zts26708e	I'm going to get Biaron this time!zts26709e	*zts26710e	The ground is shaking...zts26711e	What's going on here?zts26712e	*zts26713e	Phew, that big robot is finally defeated.zts26714e	Beep! Beep!zts26715e	(A speaker in the room comes to life.)zts26716e	What's that sound?zts26717e	Giant Arma test... complete.zts26718e	Saving data... complete.zts26719e	Analysing weaknesses... complete.zts26720e	Giant Arma is being redesigned based on the test results.zts26721e	So it's not over yet? Who are you? Why are you building the big robot?zts26722e	To collect all the Photostones on the surface.zts26723e	Are you serious? That robot will kill a lot of people!zts26724e	Where is the robot being constructed? Tell me!zts26725e	Access to this information is protected by a security code.zts26726e	What is the code?zts26727e	I don't know.zts26728e	That code is incorrect.zts26729e	I won't be able to beat an even stronger robot by myself. I've got to go back to the city.zts26730e	Thank you for your input. You have been placed on the blacklist.zts26731e	Dispatching army to eliminate <pname>.zts26732e	Time remaining to target...zts26733e	Damn it, they're after me. Let's get out of here.zts26734e	*zts26735e	Have those who were missing returned?zts26736e	Unfortunately, not a single one.zts26737e	Then I'll have to take a look around the area.zts26738e	I would be very grateful if you would. But be careful. Don't you go disappearing too, <pname>.zts26739e	Thanks, but I'll be all right.zts26740e	(I've got to look for clues in the Polluted Area. Maybe it's got something to do with the big monster.)zts26741e	I'll defeat the monsters nearby first.zts26742e	(A lump of goo. So has the monster really returned? Let's see if I find any more.)zts26743e	(Another lump of goo. So the Moss Giant really is back. How can I stop him from being reborn?)zts26744e	(I'd better take this slime back to the city. Maybe someone there will have an idea.)zts26745e	You're back safe and well! I'm so relieved.zts26746e	I said I would, didn't I? By the way, it looks like the Moss Giant is back.zts26747e	Really? But you defeated him! And now he's come back to life?zts26748e	I think so.zts26749e	We must find a way to stop him from being reborn. I've brought some of his slime with me. Do you know anything about it?zts26750e	(The Power Plant Manager looks at the slime, nauseated.)zts26751e	No, I'm not the right person to ask. Try the inventor, maybe he'll know something.zts26752e	Hello <pname>. What brings you to me?zts26753e	The Moss Giant I killed has come back to life.zts26754e	I think I can beat him again, but first we need to find a way of stopping him from being reborn.zts26755e	Can you do anything with this lump of slime from the Moss Giant?zts26756e	(The inventor looks at the slime with interest.)zts26757e	Hmm, it looks like jelly made from contaminated water. I've got no idea whether I can get any meaningful information from it.zts26758e	But I'll do my best.zts26759e	(And in the meantime, I'll go and deal with the Moss Giant again.)zts26760e	I've defeated the Moss Giant.zts26761e	Thank you. So he really had returned. Have you managed to find out how to stop him from being reborn?zts26762e	I'm afraid not. The inventor is studying the slime but it doesn't look particularly promising...zts26763e	I'll probably have to keep killing the Moss Giant again and again.zts26764e	*zts26765e	I'm sorry. Techron won't give up.zts26766e	Yes, that was to be expected.zts26767e	Giant Arma is probably being reconstructed. <pname>, can you please go and check in the lab?zts26768e	I will. I'll go and look for evidence in the lab.zts26769e	(There are too many enemies. I'll see to it that there are less of them first.)zts26770e	(The ground is really shaking. Giant Arma must have been rebuilt.)zts26771e	You were right, Giant Arma was reconstructed.zts26772e	But you defeated him again before he could be improved. Thank you, <pname>!zts26773e	Well, it's not really much help, the next one will come soon.zts26774e	We've got to find Techron and free him from his madness, or this will never be over.zts26775e	Yes, we have to find him. In the meantime, please make sure Giant Arma can't cause any damage, <pname>.zts26776e	*zts26777e	Is it true that the royals are gatheirng?zts26778e	Yes, and more keep coming.zts26779e	If no one deals with them, they'll become a danger to the city.zts26780e	I can take a hint. Where can I find them?zts26781e	We're currently gathering more information. They're not easy to track down, they keep changing their location.zts26782e	Then I'll find them myself.zts26783e	The must be somewhere on the east side of the Power Plant. My soldiers are guarding the exits, so they can't escape.zts26784e	Understood. I'll go to the Power Plant.zts26785e	In fact, there are a lot of royals hanging around here. But not for much longer.zts26786e	Done. Now what?zts26787e	(Some mechanical components are lying on the floor.)zts26788e	Oh, that must have belonged to the royals.zts26789e	I'll take it with me to the city.zts26790e	There you are! Did you find their hideout?zts26791e	Not yet. But I've brought something.zts26792e	(You pass the mechanical parts you gathered to Mullang.)zts26793e	Do you know what this is?zts26794e	Yes, communication devices and circuits from the machine soldiers. They could give us some clues, thank you.zts26795e	I'll ask my engineers.zts26796e	Please wait a moment.zts26797e	(The engineers tinker and whisper among themselves.)zts26798e	(Shortly afterwards, Mullang returns looking extremely pleased.)zts26799e	We were able to extract the coordinates of their hiding place from the circuits you gathered.zts26800e	Ha! Where is it?zts26801e	I'll show you on the map. Can you take care of it?zts26802e	(I know where that is. I'll go and clear the place up, then.)zts26803e	(Done. I should return to Mullang.)zts26804e	I've defeated them all.zts26805e	What a relief! They can't attack the city now.zts26806e	We have nothing to fear from them for the time being.zts26807e	But we'll need to keep an eye out for the remaining royals all the same.zts26808e	Just give me a shout if you have any more problems.zts26809e	*zts26810e	Where can I find the cave?zts26811e	In the Polluted Area.zts26812e	I'll give you the coordinates.zts26813e	Be careful. There are a lot of monsters in the cave.zts26814e	(I've found the cave. I'm curious to see what it's like inside.)zts26815e	(I've defeated enough monsters. Now I just need to tell the Power Plant Manager.)zts26816e	I've defeated the monsters in the cave.zts26817e	Thank you very much. Now we have a moment's peace.zts26818e	But in time, new monsters will appear.zts26819e	Can you help out again if it gets too dangerous for us again?zts26820e	Of course. Just let me know if you need help.zts26821e	Yes. No problem. Is that Techron?zts26822e	Okay. Listen: Wherever you are, you can come back.zts26823e	The war is over. Biaron is in prison. You don't have to hide anymore.zts26824e	You saved me, <pname>. Thank you very much.zts26825e	Conversation with Tieclozts26826e	I'm Tieclo, the new interim president.zts26827e	If you don't cause any problems, you're welcome to stay.zts26828e	Conversation with the Undercity Powerplant Managerzts26829e	Conversation with Alloszts26830e	I can't talk to people who don't have authorisation.zts26831e	NosBazaar of the Undercityzts26832e	This is the Undercity, our capital.zts26833e	Oh! Who would have thought that such a large city was hiding here?zts26834e	I fear that the nearby enemies are unfortunately very aware of this.zts26835e	Is there anything I can help you with?zts26836e	As a matter of fact, yes. I'm supposed to provide all these soldiers with food.zts26837e	But I need some ingredients.zts26838e	You don't happen to have a bit of time to get me some?zts26839e	If you kill monsters in the Polluted Area, you're sure to find something edible.zts26840e	Uhm, I'm supposed to get something edible from the Polluted Area? It's called Polluted Area because... well... it's polluted?!zts26841e	Oh, don't you worry about that. I have a fantastic recipe, you won't notice a thing.zts26842e	Alright, as you wish.

Hopefully she knows what she's doing).zts26843e	To Undercity under Biaron's rulezts26844e	Enter the Advanced Land of Life (Champion Level: 60-90)zts26845e	Would you like to move to the Advanced Land of Life?
